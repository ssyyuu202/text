Background
The tax was implemented with the stated intention of raising funds for the English state lottery to monitor the circulation of newspapers and other periodicals and to restrict publication of writing intended to excite hatred and contempt of the Government and holy religion All periodicals were already required by law to state the address and name of the owner making taxation easily enforced on publishers and allowing the government to see where legally printed publications were coming from In order to exempt themselves from the tax periodical authors pledged their patronage to members of the Parliament of Great Britain leading to publications rising and falling based on the party in power and a general distrust in periodicals of the time
British essayists were critical of the tax and the effect it had on British literature According to English writer Samuel Johnson A news-writer is a man without virtue who writes lies at home for his own profit To these compositions is required neither genius nor knowledge neither industry nor sprightliness but contempt of shame and indifference to truth are absolutely necessary These essayists often saw retribution for their published words Henry Hetherington a prominent radical was imprisoned for claiming the tax was a tax on knowledge and his printing presses were ordered to be destroyed Many others greeted the arrival of the stamps with outrage and violence Most called for a boycott and some organized attacks on the customhouses and homes of tax collectors After months of protest and an appeal before the British House of Commons Parliament voted to repeal the Stamp Act in March 1766

Spiropyran

A spiropyran is a type of organic chemical compound known for photochromic properties that provide this molecule with the ability of being used in medical and technological areas Spiropyrans were discovered in the early twentieth century However it was in the middle twenties when Fisher and Hirshbergin observed their photochromic characteristics and reversible reaction In 1952 Fisher and co-workers announced for the first time photochromism in spiropyrans Since then there have been many studies on photochromic compounds that have continued up to the present
Synthesis
There are two methods for the production of spiropyrans The first one can be by condensation of methylene bases with o-hydroxy aromatic aldehydes or the condensation of the precursor of methylene bases Spiropyrans generally could be obtained by boiling the aldehyde and the respective benzazolium salts in presence of pyridine or piperidine The general formula of the synthesis of spiropyrans is shown in the Figure 1
The second way is by condensation of o-hydroxy aromatic aldehydes with the salts of heterocyclic cations which contains active methylene groups and isolation of the intermediate styryl salts This second procedure is followed by the removal of the elements of the acid from the obtained styryl salt such as perchloric acid with organic bases gaseous ammonia or amines
Structure
A spiropyran is a 2H-pyran isomer that has the hydrogen atom at position two replaced by a second ring system linked to the carbon atom at position two of the pyran molecule in a spiro way So there is a carbon atom which is common on both rings the pyran ring and the replaced ring The second ring the replaced one is usually heterocyclic but there are exceptions
When the spiropyran is in a solution with polar solvents or when it receives heating thermochromism or radiation photochromism it becomes coloured because its structure has changed and it has been transformed into the merocyanine form
The structural differences between spiropyran and merocyanine form is that while in the first one the ring is in the closed form in the other one the ring is opened The photochromism is due to electrocyclic cleavage of the C-spiro-O bond with photoexcitation
Photochromism in spiropyrans
Photochromism is the phenomenon that produces a change of colour in a substance by incident radiation In other words Photochromism is a light induced change of colour of a chemical substance The spiropyrans are one of the photochromatic molecules that have raised more interest lately These molecules consist of two heterocyclic functional groups in orthogonal planes bound by a carbon atom Spiropyrans are one of the oldest families of photochromism As solids the spiropyrans do not present photochromism It is possible in solution and in the dry state that radiation between 250?nm and 380?nm approximately is able to by breaking the C-O binding transform the spiropyrans into its colour emitting merocyanin-form The structure of the colourless molecules the substract of the reaction N is more thermodynamically stable than the product - depending on the solvent in which it is stored For example in NMP the equelibrium could be switched more toward the merocyanin form solvatochromic effects The photoisomers of the spiropyrans have a structure similar to cyaninesÅfs even though it is not symmetric about the center of the polymethine chain and it is classified as a merocyanine Figure 2
Once the irradiation has stopped the merocyanine in solution starts to discolourate and to revert to its original form the spiropyran N
Procedure
Applications
Photochromic thermochromic solvatochromic and electrochromic characteristics of spiropyrans make them especially important in the technology area Most of their applications are based on their photochromic properties
Photochromic compounds based on spiropyrans spirooxazines and chromenes are being investigated because of their silver-free light-sensitive properties that could be used for optical recording data including thin films photoswitches sensors that discern light of certain wavelength light filters with modulated transmission and miniature hybrid multifunctional materials
Thanks to the creation of novel media sensitive to IR radiation and the potential of spiropyrans for optical recording data semiconductor lasers as activating source of radiation are possible
Spiropyrans with ion complexes and spiropyran copolymers which are part of powdered and film materials have been used too to record optical data and increase the length of time of its storage
Another group of spiropyrans which contain indoline or nitrogen heterocycles and the indolinospirothiapyrans found their application in film forms of photochromic materials using polyester resins Those resins with a high refractive index were used to make photochromic lenses Moreover spiropyrans are being used in cosmetics
New types of modified spiropyrans polymers contained in photochromic compounds found their use in the creation of photoreceptors The ones with rhodopsin as a compound are adopted to raise the level of the photosignal
Another collection of spiropyrans characterized for their sensitivity to UV radiation are detectors for the protection of organs for the production of light filters with modulated transmission or photochromic lenses
The determination of peroxidase activity and NO2 levels in the atmosphere are applications of carboxylated spiropyrans
Today spiropyrans are most used as molecular logic devices photochromic and electrooptical devices molecular and supramolecular logic switches photoswitches and multifunctional artificial receptors


Aman Futures Group

Aman Futures Group simply referred as Aman Futures was an investment and privately held company based in Malaysia with branches in the Philippines It has also been allegedly engaged in a pyramid scheme The group was founded by Manuel K Amalilio a Filipino of Malaysian descent
Controversy
Aman Futures was reported as a pyramid scheme by the National Bureau of Investigation of the Philippines that duped some 15,000 people in Mindanao and the Visayas of P12 billion US$ 295,000,000 est Authorities from the Philippines have set a manhunt for Manuel K Amalilio the founder of the company who left the Philippines for Sabah Malaysia The double-your-money was a phrase being pitched to join the network NBI has said that there is about 8,000 complaints filed against the company and over 100,000 Filipino families were victimized Irate victims of Aman Futures have ransacked an office rented by the company in Pagadian City
After the manhunt for the brain behind the scam was launched two of the company's employees surrendered Maria Donna Coyme who is reportedly the chief finance officer of Aman Futures and Jacob Razuman one of the firmÅfs top brokers are currently being investigated for their role in the scam said the National Bureau of Investigation and the Philippine National Police
Twenty one Filipino police officers and two fire officers filed syndicated estafa complaint against the company They said they were promised a return of their investment within eight days and a 50 percent to 80 percent profit for 17 to 20 days
The Malacanang Palace has assured that the victims of Aman Futures should not take matters of their own as authorities are doing their work to put to jail those responsible for the pyramid scam that duped thousands in the Visayas and Mindanao area
Gunmen related to the 14 December 2012 gunshot in Zamboanga City were possible employees from Aman Futures Investigators said it was possible that the attack may be linked to the Aman Futures that is known to have victimized thousands including many policemen
In 2013 the founder of Aman Futures Manuel K Amalilio was caught in Malaysia after pleading guilty to charges of holding false travel documents He was then supposed to be deported to Manila on Friday 25 January at estimated time of 19:45 PST to be jailed the NBI siad However the Malaysian authorities stopped Amalilio's deportation and was sentenced a two-year imprisonment in Malaysia Some of the members of the Malaysian opposition in the Philippines disagreed in the Malaysian authorities stopping of Amalilio's deportation during an interview at ANC They also have questioned the jail sentence handed down to him in Malaysia


Medicine in Azerbaijan

Medicine in Azerbaijan serves for protecting health and prosperity of citizens of the Republic of Azerbaijan Reforms in the sphere of medical care and direction of health care system are parts of a global strategic development program of economic and social infrastructure This program is based on principles of establishment of high life democratic society with market economy
Early history
History of medicine in Azerbaijan has deep roots Ancient people believed in sorcery for struggle against various sicknesses Carvings and painted signs in Azykh Cave dated from the Stone Age evidence about it
Early people used medicinal plants for treatment of different sicknesses Their experience has developed and became a traditional medicine Development of oral and written branches of traditional medicine was dividing with origination of writing
Rich flora of Azerbaijan attracted attention of doctors and scientists from ancient times A lot of medicinal plants were used for prophylaxis and treatment Seeds roots flowers and leaves of these plants were used in treatment Women easily observed the influence fruits vegetables and medicinal tea upon organism and their influence upon cough bleeding ache diarrhea and other illnesses
From ancient manuscripts it is known that they used not only plants but were also acquainted with surgery treatment of tumors and setting of broken bones For instance Nariman Narimanov found a human skull dated from the 4th millennium BC Eneolithic with traces of trepanning on it in Erefli village of Agdam Rayon In 1971 archeologist H.Kesemenli found out a skull dated from the late Bronze and early Iron Ages on which a trepanation was performed in Khachbulag village of Dashkasan Rayon R.Gasimova who investigated the skull said that Ågartificial trepanation was performed near junction of parietal and frontal bonesÅh
In 1958 pitchers dated from the 6th century BC with burned rues which were used as medicine for treatment of rheumatism fever and prophylactics of various illnesses were found out in Garakepektepe village of Mugan plain during archeological excavations
Aromatherapy was also broadly spread It was believed that smell of a quince strengthens bodyÅfs energy Lemon was used for adjusting of nervous system and apple for stimulation of brainÅfs work
In ancient times there was an active cultural interchange between Azerbaijanis and residents of Mesopotamia Sesame oil and crocus were imported from Sumer There is information about medicinal drugs and medicine in Avesta a sacred book of fire worshippers and the ancient monument of people of Azerbaijan and Iran There is also written that Åga doctor has three weapons word herbs and a knifeÅh A doctor curing by words and suggestion was considered as the best at that time
Medicine of Caucasian Albania descendants of which are considered Azerbaijanis was also developing Medicinal plants were planted there from the Roman Empire Works by Hippocrates and Claudius Galenus were popular there because of spreading of Christianity and Greek language Some knowledge about medicine was taught in religious schools and churches
Development of medicine in the Middle Ages
In this period medicine was quickly developing which is evidenced by archeological findings For instance polished marble vessels for antimony and golden brushes for applying it which was used as anti-cough and antiemetic medicine in the Middle Ages were found out Sick men drunk wine from these made of antimony cups Various glass vessels used for preparation and storage of medicines which were used by alchemists both in traditional medicine and pharmacology were found out in Shamakhi during excavations These findings confirm that people in Azerbaijan were engaged in pharmaceutics in the Middle Ages
According to Farid Alakbarli a historian Turkish traditional medicine which was called ÅgTurkachareÅh and was similar to shamanism and treatment by wizardry and herbs began to be spread in the 4th century AD with entering of Turkic tribes into Azerbaijan In Turkish doctors were called gam which meant ÅgshamanÅh or otachi which meant ÅgherbalistÅh Herbals were called ota ot is herb in translation from Turkic Goddess Oleng was considered as the patroness of doctors
In VIII Shirvan where mainly Albanians and Iranians lived was occupied by Arabs Sciences and culture developed due to mutual influence of cultures as a part of single Caliphate Universities observatories libraries mosques and hospitals were built Progress of medicine is observed namely in Islamic period At that time madrasa where Arabic and Persian languages religion math calligraphy history and literature were taught functioned in Azerbaijan Medicine and alchemy were also taught there ÅgMalhamÅh madrasa in Shamakhi was one of the most famous madrasaÅfs of that time Eminent scientist and doctor Kafiyaddin Omar ibn Osman ? uncle of eminent Azerbaijani poet Khagani Shirvani ? led this educational institution
Copy of ÅgThe Canon of MedicineÅh work written in Arabic in 1030 by doctor Ibn Sina famed in Europe as ÅgAvicennaÅh and who also was in Azerbaijan where he collected information about medicine was found out in Azerbaijan among other manuscripts about medicine In his work Ibn Sina wrote about Saburkhast settlement in Azerbaijan This copy of ÅgThe CanonÅh was made in Baghdad in 1143 and is considered one of the most ancient manuscripts in the sphere of pharmacology and medicine in the world and the most ancient in Azerbaijan which was broadly used both in whole Muslim world and also in Christian Europe and which had a great influence upon development of medicine There are descriptions of hundreds of medicines in it
Bahmanyar al Azerbaijani died in 1067 a student of Ibn Sina also famed among scientists of the 11th century Bahmanyar touched upon issues in medicine in his philosophic work called Ågat-TahsilÅh ÅgUnderstandingÅh
Manuscript copy of ÅgAl-Magala as-SalasunÅh ÅgThe thirteenth treatiseÅh written in the 13th century by Abu al-Gasim al-Zahravi an eminent scientist from Andalusia who famed in Europe as Abulgasis died in 1013 also came from Azerbaijan It is one of the most ancient manuscripts of this book About 200 surgery instruments had been mentioned in this book Their assignments also had been explained there The work influenced upon development of surgery both in the East and also in Europe Professor Ziya Bunyadov translated it into Russian and after it was published in Moscow in 1983
Medieval doctors warned sick people against tiredness For example Mahmud inb Ilyas a doctor lived in the 12th century advised nervous people to listen to mugham
Medicine was strongly developing in the 13th century in the Great Seljuq Empire of Azerbaijani Atabegs Almost every eastern scientist and philosopher had a work in medicine Residents from different oblasts of Azerbaijan compiled rewrote and investigated books in medicine including monuments of the 14th-18th centuries There are more than four hundred manuscripts in medicine in Azerbaijani Arabic Persian and Turkish languages both written in the territory of modern Azerbaijan and brought from different oblasts in the Muhammad Fuzuli Institute of Manuscripts of Azerbaijan of Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences in Baku According to K?ichir? Matsuura the former Director-General of UNESCO Ågthis collection shows the role of Azerbaijan in development of world medicineÅh
ÅgZahirai NizamshahiÅh written by Rustam Jurjani in the 13th century was also partly investigated in Azerbaijan Its manuscript had been copied in the 16th century is saved in Baku Institute of Manuscripts There were descriptions of pharmaceutical herbs substances of animal origin minerals and some difficult medicines are included into it The manuscript hasnÅft been found in any other storage of the world and exists in only exemplar in Azerbaijan
ÅgAbout treatment scienceÅh work by Mahmud ibn Ilyas the 14th century in which fundamental ideas of medicine symptoms and reasons of specific illnesses are described also famed
Yusif Garabaghi an Azerbaijani doctor of the 16th century who came from Karabakh wrote many medicine treatises and also ÅgExplanations and interpretations of ÅgThe Canon of MedicineÅh by Ibn SinaÅh He lived in Central Asia for a long time and taught in Samarkand
Mir Muhammad Momin palatial figure at Suleyman the Safavid wrote several instructive works in Persian including ÅgTohfat al MomininÅh in 1669 Descriptions of more than 4000 plants animals minerals and other ingredients used in medicine were written in the work Momin described each plant its specific characteristic where it can be picked other oblasts where it is used and its name in other languages such as Chinese and Hindi in detail
In 1712 Muhammad Yusif Shirvani wrote ÅgTibbnameÅh in Azerbaijani language Being a palatial doctor Shirvani advised to use natural minerals for treatment for example rubbing of orange peel while tiredness in neck In this work itÅfs also written that resting place of sick men should be decorated with flowers in light-blue green and white tints It means that even the color had a great importance in works of medieval healers
Generally in the 17th-18th centuries number of works had been written in the sphere of medicine and pharmacology by Azerbaijani scientists such as Murtuzagulu Shamlu sexual pathologist Abdulhasan Maraghai pharmacologists such as Hasan Rza oglu Shirvani Haji Suleyman Iravani and others 724 kinds of medicinal plants were described
Development of medicine in the 19th and early 20th century
In the early 19th century when northern khanates of Azerbaijan Shirvan Baku Nakhchivan Quba Talysh Karabakh Shaki Derbend and other were joined to Russia and the southern Tabriz Khoy Ardabil and others ones to Iran Azerbaijani community in Iran continued to exist under the influence of Persian and generally the whole Islamic culture but Azerbaijani community in the Russian Empire later the USSR was developing under the influence of Europeanized secular Russian culture mainly in the Soviet times Medicine in two regions was developing in two different ways
There wasnÅft any European like pharmacy in Azerbaijan until 1828 During the reign of the Russian such hospitals and pharmacies were established in Azerbaijan as in the whole South Caucasus where Russian doctors applied their skills
Abdulkhalig Akhundov founded basis of scientific investigation in the history of medicine in Azerbaijan Abdulkhalig studied and translated famous pharmaceutics encyclopedia written by Abu Mansur Kharavi in the 9th century from Persian into German After the book was published in Germany Abdulkhalig Akhundov also defended a dissertation in the history of medicine at the University of Tartu In 1895 Dr.Mammad Rza Vakilov Dr.Kerimbey Mehmandarov and others established Baku Union of Medicine
Hasan bey Zardabi and Mirza Fatali Akhundov used knowledge in medicine in their works for expression of philosophical ideas Akhundov was one of the firsts who acted against traditional healers He was the author of works about hygiene and sanitary Zardabi also had an important role in development of medicine He was the first Azerbaijani in the sphere of natural history and Social Darwinism
Being the author of ÅgAkinchiÅh ? the first Azerbaijani newspaper in the Russian Empire ? Zardabi together with Akhundov worked upon works about malaria devastated the country at that time His ÅgHygieneÅh book is the first scientific research work about medicine in the sphere of hygiene in Azerbaijan It was published in 1914 in Azerbaijan
Sometimes doctors gave gratuitous help to sick men During cholera devastation in Nakhchivan in 1847 Mirza Nasrulla Mirza Ali oglu gratuitously treated both Azerbaijani and Armenian sick men due to which he was respected among people
Alongside all these pharmacies where herbs imported from Iran and India were sold were also functioning at that time Such pharmacies were in every city of Azerbaijan ? Baku Shamakhi Shusha Agdam Nakhchivan Lahij Ordubad Salyan Lankaran and etc Mir-Baba Mir-Abdulla oglu father of eminent Azerbaijani literary man Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli had a pharmacy in Aghdam 142 kinds of medicines more than 100 of which were made of herbs were sold in his pharmacy Chamanzaminli himself being the son of the pharmacist described everyday life and practices of Azerbaijani healers of the 19th century in his narrative called ÅgThe DoctorÅh
Such pharmacies were mainly in Iranian Southern Azerbaijan At the beginning of the 20th century treatment by herbs was enough spread method of treatment in Azerbaijan But healers perceived appearance of new modern medicines as something strange
ÅgMolla NasraddinÅh ? popular Azerbaijani magazine of that time which was of great importance in medicine education criticized such kinds of remains of the past ridiculed backwardness of healers-evils of that time their ignorant treatment of modern knowledge in medicine For instance a caricature called ÅgHoly BukharaÅh painted by Azim Azimzade was given in the 20th issue of the magazine 1911 Here the image of Bukhara emir doubtfully treating recommendations of the doctor about a new medicine
Medicine in Azerbaijan Democratic Republic
In 1918 Ministry of health-care led by Dr.Rafiyev was established in independent Azerbaijan Democratic Republic Dozens of new pharmacies and hospitals were opened in Baku and Ganja at that time
Many students of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic sent for educating abroad mainly to Germany Saint Petersburg Moscow Kiev and other cities learned medicine there
In 1919 Baku State University with a medicine faculty was established in Baku Professor V.I.Razumovskiy an eminent surgeon became its first chairman until 1920 History of medicine was also taught there Razumovskiy established the First Preparatory Commission for a short period of time Admission examinations were held in August of the same year and so the first course of students ? future doctors ? was collected
On August 2 1922 there were only three Azerbaijanis ? A.Alakbarov Jeyran Sultanova and Adliya Shahtakhtinskaya-Babayeva who became the Doctor of Sciences and Professor ? among the first 29 alumni of medicine faculty
Medicine in the Azerbaijan SSR
After establishment of the Soviet Power during the 1920s pharmacies where herbs were sold were closed and manuscripts written with Arabic alphabet were burned It was a part of the Soviet PowerÅfs policy carried out against Islam mainly in Azerbaijan and Central Asia
Nariman Narimanov who also was a doctor was the leader of a newly established administration From 1920 to 1921 Aghahuseyn Kazimov and then in 1935 Mir Movsum Gadirly were national commissars of health-care in the Azerbaijan SSR
In 1930 Azerbaijan State Medical Institute was established and M.N.Gadirly was its first rector Eminent scientists and professors such as I.Shirokorogov S.Davidenkov F.Ilyin Lev Levin N.Ushinkiy k.Malinovskiy and others had a great contribution on development of the institute Scientists such as M.Mirgasimov M.A.Topchubashov A.M.Aliyev I.M.Ismayilzade and others graduated from this institute who then brought Azerbaijani medical science fame
Generally from 1920 to 1940 hundreds of polyclinics hospitals and pharmacies were established in Azerbaijan Academicians such as Mirasadulla Mirgasimov and Mustafa Topchubashov and professors such as Alibey Alibeyov Kamil Balakishiyev and others were world-famous scientists and doctors of Azerbaijan
Medicine in the Republic of Azerbaijan
New stage in development of medicine began after Azerbaijan acquired independence More than 10 laws were established in the sphere of health-care In March 1998 Heydar Aliyev former president of Azerbaijan signed a direction ÅgAbout establishment of State Committee of reforms in the sphere of health-careÅh Unique state policy was established in the country and quality of medical service of the population was also improved Today medical centers and modern pharmaceutics industry of Azerbaijan is created at a level of world standards A national plan against illnesses such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis is developed in the country In 2001 a direction about celebration of June 17 as a holiday of health-care employers was signed In 2004 Azerbaijani Association of Medicine Historians which was included into International Union of the History of Medicine headquartered in Paris in 2005 was established The First National Conference of the Association was held on February 1?2 of the same year in Baku
Since February 1 2008 governmental medical institutions show a gratuitous medical aid to population by a direction signed by Ogtay Shirinov a minister of health-hare of Azerbaijan In November 2009 Azerbaijani doctors performed the first operation in heart for prevention of arrhythmia
43 new hospitals and diagnostic centers 46 outpatient polyclinics 4 restoration centers for disabled persons and 12 diagnostics and health centers were put into operation during the last years 30 medical institutions and 5 polyclinics are to be constructed in 2013 Indicators of longevity and birth rate have improved because of the development of the medicine in the country


Sacred Heart of Jesus Church Cleveland Ohio

Sacred Heart of Jesus was a Catholic parish church in Cleveland Ohio and part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland It was located at the north-west corner of intersection of East 71st St and Kazimier St in a part of the South Broadway neighborhood previously known in Polish as and nicknamed Goosetown
Both the church building and the school building are GNIS named features The church school and rectory buildings are listed together as a Cleveland Designated Landmark
The church was closed
History
Between 1885 and 1889 a large number of Poles settled in South Cleveland in the area of East 71st St and Harvard Ave They lived too far away from St Stanislaus church for them to conveniently either attend Mass or for their children to attend the parish school They petitioned Bishop Richard Gilmour for permission to form a new parish and build a church for their own use
Founding
The petition to form a new parish and build a church was granted and the parish was founded in ??about 42 years after the Diocese of Cleveland was erected by Pope Pius IX
19th Century
Father the pastor of St Stanislaus was authorized to secure a church site which he did in the summer of 1889 although the deed was given a few months later??? The property by was secured at a cost of $2,500 It was located at the corner of East 71st St and Krakow St Shortly after the property was secured a combination frame church and school was begun the cornerstone for which was laid on Sunday by Monsignor Felix M Boff V.G In December of the same year the church was used for the first time It was dedicated on Sunday by Boff who also blessed the church bell on the same day The church with pews altars etc cost about $15,000 The upper story is used for divine worship and the lower story serves as a parochial school divided into three rooms The school was attended by two hundred pupils taught by Felician Sisters of Detroit who have had charge since its opening in the spring of 1890 The church was attended from St Stanislaus as a mission until the appointment of Father M F Orzechowski as first resident pastor During that year a pastoral residence was built at a cost of about $2,000 and in 1892 a fence was put around the entire property Orzechowski left in July 1893 The parish was attended from St Stanislaus Church until when Father James Kula was appointed Kula became discouraged owing to the parish debt and a want of correspondence with his well-intended efforts on the part of some of his parishioners Kula left and was immediately succeeded by Father Paul Cwiakala who in a very short time gained the love and confidence of his people During 1896 an organ and an elegant baptismal font were secured???the former the gift of a church society the latter donated by a parishioner The pews were also repainted and a good supply of church vestments etc was bought As Cwiakala's health was failing Bishop Ignatius Frederick Horstmann permitted him to go to Europe for three months?July to September 1896 during which time his place was supplied by Father L Kisielewiecz a professor in the Polish seminary at Detroit On his return from Europe Cwiakala reassumed pastoral charge of the parish For nearly three years?till July 1899?he labored faithfully and zealously for the best interests of the people and in consequence overtaxed his strength Again he was obliged to ask for a period of rest to recuperate He was granted a leave of absence and left for Europe and Rome in July 1899
20th Century
Father Francis Wegrsznowski was given temporary charge of the parish and in July 1900 was succeeded by Father Victor Szyrocki In 1903 the parish was in excellent condition George Francis Houck then the Chancellor wrote in 1903 that its members are entirely of the laboring class they contribute generously of their earnings to the support of church and school
Architecture
The property by was secured at a cost of $2,500
Original Church
Shortly after the property was secured a combination frame church and school was begun the cornerstone for which was laid on Sunday by Mgr Felix M Boff V G in December of the same year the church was used for the first time It was dedicated on Sunday by Boff who also blessed the church bell on the same day The church with pews altars etc cost about $15,000 The upper story was used for divine worship and the lower story served as a parochial school divided into three rooms
Records
The records of this church and all churches closed after 1975 can be found in the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland Archives Diocesan policy is to keep all archive records closed


Smothering food

Smothering meat seafood or vegetables is a cooking technique used in both Cajun and Creole cuisines of Louisiana The technique involves cooking in a covered pan over low heat with a small amount of liquid and can be seen as a form of stove-top braising The meat dishes cooked in this fashion are typically served over boiled or steamed white rice as a rice and gravy while the vegetables are typically served as side dishes
Description
This method of food preparation involves using the Maillard reaction to brown the meat or vegetables and then deglazing with stock or water and simmering the mixture over low heat for an extended period of time It is often done in a cast iron pot or dutch oven so the heat can be evenly applied and distributed
Meat
A large variety of meats are smothered in South Louisiana cuisine including both domestic animals and wild game Domestic animals cooked in this fashion include chicken domestic duck pork beef including such organs as the liver and domestic rabbit Wild game commonly cooked in this fashion include squirrel rabbit nutria rat feral pig woodcock wild duck and venison Originally a dish made from cheap cuts of meat favored by farmers and laborers popular versions of the dish such as smothered steak and smothered pork roast are served throughout Acadiana at local plate lunch houses Raised on Rice and Gravy a 2009 documentary film by Conni Castille and Allison Bohl chronicles the prevalence of the dish at local plate lunch houses and its enduring popularity in local cuisine
Shellfish
In French the word etouffee means smothered Etouffee can be made using different shellfish the most popular version of the dish being Crawfish Etouffee although shrimp is also used Originally etouffee was a popular dish in the Acadiana area surrounding Breaux Bridge In the late twentieth century a waiter at the popular Bourbon Street restaurant Galatoire's brought the dish in to his employer to try The dish was added to their menu and other restaurants in the city soon followed with the dish gaining in popularity with locals and tourists alike Many Cajun restaurant owners claim that etouffee is the most popular dish on their menus
Vegetables
Varieties of vegetables cooked by smothering include cabbage okra potatoes and corn The vegetables are kept from burning by the addition of animal fats or oils or the addition of meat products such as salt pork or andouille


Kiss a Little Longer

Kiss a Little Longer was an advertising slogan used by the William Wrigley Jr Corporation to market their gum products in the late 1970s
Overview
In 1976 Big Red joined the Wm Wrigley Jr Company the largest American manufacturer of chewing gum The Wrigley family at the time also included Doublemint Wrigley's Spearmint Juicy Fruit and Freedent Seeing a need in the cinnamon gum market for a full-sizes stick Wrigley launched the campaign in 1979 The advertising campaign's jingle and refrain Kiss a Little Longer became familiar to viewers across the United States in the years afterwards when it was used
Target Market
Since its creation Big Red's Kiss a Little Longer campaign targeted teens and young adults This age group consumed half the chewing gum in the United States at the time Big Red's other major target had been consumers of competitor cinnamon gums especially Dentyne
Marketing Strategy
In 1979 three years after Big Red was introduced the brand's marketing strategy was re-positioned on the concept of long lasting fresh breath The Little Longer campaign was developed to communicate Big Red's product superiority and the benefits it conferred on those who wanted to stay close longer The marketing situation and conclusions that led to the Little Longer campaign began with an awareness that the use and market share of Big Red were declining At the time Big Red was only weakly perceived as a cinnamon gum compared to Dentyne a leader in the national market The advertising agency BBDO identified two problems that many cinnamon gum chewers faced that Wrigley's could exploit with Big Red First the gum did not keep a chewer's breath fresh for a long enough time and second many brands of cinnamon gum were too small Big Red was superior to its competitors in both of these senses and the marketing statement No little cinnamon gum freshens breath longer than Big Red was developed in response and had appeared in many advertisements since then
This approach was used to show the end benefit of longer lasting fresh breath primarily the emotional rewards of being closer to others a little longer The tone was meant to be fun a lively Lighthearted humor and wholesomeness formed the creative base on which Big Red advertising was created The popular Little Longer campaign showed consumers that many pleasurable situations in which to chew Big Red gum Throughout its history the advertising slogan was used primarily in television advertising In 1991 radio spots were introduced relying on what had become a familiar theme with familiar music For a brief time from 1987 to 1990 print ads also appeared
Outcome
The Little Longer campaign drove Big Red market share growth for 15 consecutive years When Big Red was introduced in 1976 Dentyne was the cinnamon gum leader but by 1987 backed by the Little Longer campaign Big Red became the number one cinnamon gum and remained so for years In recent years Wrigley's and Big Red have moved away from the Kiss a Little Longer line in attempts to focus consumers on a new formula that results in even more longer lasting flavor

Bonnee Buttered Beef Steaks

Bonnee Buttered Beef Steaks were the flagship product of the Bonnee Frozen Products Company which also produced frozen tamales and cubed steaks Bonnee Buttered Beef Steaks consisted of Ågfinely chopped beef molded frozen sliced and buttered.Åh They were sold in packages which each contained four frozen 2-ounce beef patties and four frozen pats of 94-score butter
Bonnee Buttered Beef Steaks cost 58 cents a pound in 1956 which at that time was 10 cents a pound more than smoked ham The beef steak patties were slim so they could be cooked to perfection in about two minutes using an iron skillet on a gas stove Bonnee's were meat from the entire steer and once ground and blended they were meat reconstituted under pressure so they would not crumble like burgers but would need to be cut with a knife or torn like a thin steak Bonnee Buttered Beef Steaks co-sponsored the St Louis Hop television show the St Louis version of PhiladelphiaÅfs American Bandstand The dance contest winners were provided with the products of the show's sponsors Bonne Belle Cosmetics Bonnee Buttered Beef Steaks and Pepsi-Cola
Bonnee Buttered Beef Steaks were originated by businessman Sam Brown 1913?1996 President of Bonnee Frozen Products Co and produced from the mid-1940s to the early 1960s at the company plant at 8144 Olive Boulevard in University City Missouri Sam Brown had conceived the idea while working as a traveling salesman He had observed that the food quality in small town restaurants was hit-or-miss and concluded that restaurant owners would welcome a meat course which had consistently-high quality and was nationally distributed Starting with $125 of borrowed capital within ten years Sam Brown had a multi-million dollar business manufacturing and distributing Bonnee Buttered Beef Steaks to grocery stores restaurants and military commissaries in 38 states in the United States and in eight foreign countries
The turning point for the success of Bonnee Buttered Beef Steaks may have been a repeat sales call that Sam Brown made to the owner of a combination drug store/restaurant Even though the initial order of ten packages had sold out quickly the customer refused to re-order because he did not like them personally and he didn't sell anything that he did not like personally Looking around the store Sam said You sell castor oil in your store don't you mister Mean to tell me you like it It was a sale Sam never forgot
Sam Brown was born and raised in Kansas City Missouri He owned the Bonnee Frozen Products Co for about twenty years After he sold the business in the early 1960s he worked as a consultant retiring in the late 1970s He was a founder and the first chairman of the St Louis chapter of the Young President's Organization His father Isadore Brown had emigrated to Kansas City from Russia and built a successful scrap steel business from an initial contract to remove old railroad track

Turn-taking

Turn-taking refers to the process by which people in a conversation decide who is to speak next It depends on both cultural factors and subtle cues
Overview
The steps involved in the conversational process occur in order to maintain two important elements of conversation one person speaking at a time and the space in which one person stops talking and another begins Turn-taking is a part of the structure and systematic organization of conversation Turn-taking in conversation is not stereotypical of any type of person conversation or language Turn-taking is done in most settings by any type of person and is not reliant on a set amount of participants Turn-taking is not optimized for fairness or efficiency resulting in variations in how turn-taking occurs
Turn-taking and gender
Turn-taking in male-female interactions is highly salient Male interlocutors systematically interrupt females and tend to dominate conversations and women are frequently treated in much the same way as children are in conversations This interruption however is not due to female interlocutorsÅf failure to pursue the floor ÅgDeepÅh interruption or interruption at least two syllables before a potential utterance boundary is perpetuated more frequently by men towards women regardless of ways that women negotiate them
Language and conversation are primary ways in which social interaction is organized Unequal conversational patterns are therefore reflective of larger power disparities between men and women One study by Zimmerman and West found that in same-sex pair conversations overlap and interruption tend to be equally distributed between the two interlocutors and interruptions are clustered ? that is only a couple of the pairs did all of the interrupting For opposite sex pairs male interlocutors interrupt much more and interruptions are much more widely distributed ? that is most men did it
Gender differences in turn-taking are not invariable however and are related to the conditions and context of the speech Gendered aspects of speech and turn-taking must be recognized as being reflective of the cultures in which they exist
Questions have been raised about the correlation between interruption and dominance and its importance to gender as opposed to other social categories Studies done by Beattie find status difference more important than gender difference in predicting which speakers interrupted more
Cultural variation
Turn-taking is developed from very early on ? the first instances of it in a personÅfs life are the interactions between mother and child ? but it can still be thought of as a skill rather than an attribute The way in which turn-taking occurs is greatly affected by culture For instance Japanese culture is group-oriented and highly focused on the importance of social structure and ritual harmony in interaction This is reflected in the negotiation of turns in Japanese discourse During a news interview Japanese moderators incorporate many backchannels and reactive tokens whereas US interlocutors use hardly any For instance this exchange from the television show ÅgSunday PressÅh between the moderator and Kiichi Miyazawa a former Prime Minister is typical of a Japanese news interview
Miyazawa dakara kore wa dekimasen to iu tameniwa koredankeno koto wa deki masu to
Moderator un
Miyazawa iu koto wo kichinto shinai ikenaindanaa tu iu koto wo watakushi wa tukuzuku kangaeta mondesukara
Moderator un un un huh un huh
This demonstrates culturally different floor management strategies In Japan interlocutors invite backchannels in order to legitimize their right to speak and in the US interlocutors rush through completion points in order to maintain the floor Difference in use of backchannels could also be explained by the syntactic structures of the two languages English word order is subject-verb-object SVO whereas Japanese is subject-object-verb SOV For example the sentence ÅgWhere are you from Fumi?Åh is rendered in Japanese as
Fumi san te doko kara dakke
Fumi Ms QP question particle where from is
Therefore in English conversation it is easier for interlocutors to predict and anticipate the transition relevance points This demonstrates the interdependency of cultural and linguistic factors in turn-taking
Additionally turn-taking can vary in aspects such as time overlap and perception of silence in different cultures but can however have universal similarities as well Stivers et al 2009 cross-examined ten various languages across the globe to see if there were any similar underlying foundation in turn-taking In analyzing these languages it was discovered that all the languages had the same avoidance of wanting to overlap in conversation and wanting to minimize the silence between turn-taking However depending on the culture there was variation in the amount of time taken between turns Stivers claims that their evidence from examining these languages suggests that there is an underlying universal aspect to turn-taking
Overlapping talk while turn-taking
When more than one person is engaging in a conversation there is potential for overlapping or interruption while both or many parties are speaking at the same time Overlapping in turn-taking can be problematic for the people involved
There are four types of overlap including terminal overlaps continuers conditional access to the turn and chordal Terminal overlaps occur when a one speaker assumes the other speaker has or is about to finish their turn and begins to speak thus creating overlap Continuers are a way of the hearer acknowledging or understanding what the speaker is saying As noted by Schegloff such examples of the continuerÅfs phrases are mm hm or uh huh Conditional access to the turn implies that the current speaker yields their turn or invites another speaker to interject in the conversation usually as collaborative effort Another example that Schegloff illustrates is a speaker invited another to speak out of turn when finding a word in a word search Chordal consists of a non-serial occurrence of turns meaning both speakers turns are occurring at once such as laughter
It should be noted that the above types of overlap are considered to be non-competitive overlap in conversation
Cultural variation of overlap and timing
Harvey Sacks one of the first to study conversation found a correlation between keeping only one person speaking at a time and controlling the amount of silences between speakers Although there is no limit or specific requirement for the number of speakers in a given conversation the number of conversations will rise as the number of participants rise This is in order to maintain speech and silences more adequately This correlation between speech and silence in conversation differs across languages and cultures as shown by Jack SidnellÅfs findings in Caribbean Creole The turn-taking process in Creole is in fact orderly like that of American English Turn-taking occurs at a specific time within the conversation In order to continue to be a part of a conversation participants must listen to the speakers since overlap is common among Caribbean Creole English speakers These overlaps show agreement of what is being said while violation of overlap shows disagreement
Eye contact and turn-taking
During a conversation turn-taking may involve a cued gaze that prompts the listener that it is their turn or that the speaker is finished talking There are two gazes that have been identified and associated with turn-taking The two patterns associated with turn-taking are mutual-break and mutual-hold Mutual-break is when there is a pause in the conversation and both participants use a momentary break with mutual gaze toward each other and then breaking the gaze then continuing conversation again This type is correlated with a perceived smoothness due to a decrease in the taking of turns Mutual-hold is when the speaker also takes a pause in the conversation with mutual gaze but then still holds the gaze as he/she starts to speak again Mutual-hold is associated with less successful turn-taking process because there are more turns taken thus more turns required to complete
David Langford also argues that turn-taking is an organizational system Langford examines facial features eye contact and other gestures in order to prove that turn-taking is signaled by many gestures not only a break in speech His claims stem from analysis of conversations through speech sign language and technology His comparisons of English and American Sign Language show that turn-taking is systematic and universal across languages and cultures His research concludes that there is more to turn-taking than simply hearing a pause As other researchers have shown eye gaze is an important signal for participants of a conversation to pay attention to Usually whoever is speaking will shift their gaze away from the other participants involved in the conversation When they are finished or about to be finished speaking the speaker will revert their gaze back to the participant that will speak next
Timing and turn-taking
Another cue associated with turn-taking is that of timing Within turn-taking timing may cue the hearer to know that they have a turn to speak or make an utterance Due to the very nature of turn-taking and that it is dependent on the context timing varies within a turn and may be subjective within the conversation Vocal patterns such as pitch specific to the individual also cue the hearer to know how the timing will play out in turn-taking
Deborah Tannen also shows timing differences in relation to turn-taking For a particular study she used a recording of a conversation between a group of her friends at dinner The group included men and women from across the United States of mixed ethnicities She concluded that while the amount of space left between speakers may differ it differs most dramatically between people from different regions For instance New Yorkers tend to overlap in conversation while Californians tend to leave more space between turns and sentences

Life
His father Jaroslav Lev of Ro?mital was a brother-in-law of King George of Pod?brady
Zden?k belonged to the Catholic party in the Czech peerage When he was 26 years old he took part in public negotiations with the Hungarian king From 1498 to 1504 he was a viscount of Karl?tejn In 1504 he was appointed to the High Court Judge and 1507 he was finally appointed as High Burgrave of Prague
In this position Zden?k administered Bohemia as King Vladislaus II spent most of his time in Hungary He primarily represented the interests of the Catholic peers His aim was to expend their rights and privileges at the expense of the rest of the nobility His opponents accused him of deceit injustice and cruelty As administrator of the royal domain he was also accused of avarice However historians have described him as a righteous man who primarily demanded that his officers do their duty
In 1519 he was accused of embezzling state funds and criminal proceedings were started In 1523 he was forced to resign from his post as High Burgrave However his successor lasted for only two years and in 1525 he was re-appointed and some of his friends were also elevated to high office In the meantime the number of his Catholic enemies grew in particular the House of Rosenberg turned against him due to a dispute over the inheritance of ?esky Krumlov
In 1526 Louis II fell in the Battle of Mohacs This meant the end of Jagiellon rule in Bohemia Zden?k was considered one of the candidates to succeed Louis II although he was perhaps too old to be elected Other possible candidates were Duke Charles I of Munsterberg-Oels and Duke Frederick II of Legnica However it soon turned out that the Estates preferred Ferdinand of Habsburg who would later become Emperor as Ferdinand I Zden?k also supported Ferdinand's election Unlike his predecessor Ferdinand did not allow himself to be influenced by Zden?k
In 1528 Zden?k again had to resign as High Burgrave From then on he only concerned himself with the administration of his properties at Horni Blatna Ro?mital Velhartice Klenova Opalkou Lysa M?eno Chbany Zdechovice Ryzmberk Skaly and Pod?bra During this period his large fortune melted away as he lived beyond his means maintaining a large court and organizing numerous feasts After his death his inheritance was annihilated by his outstanding debt

Quarantine Act 1721

The Quarantine Act 1721 was a health protection measure passed by the Parliament of Great Britain During the 18th century the age of empire and sailing ships in England outbreaks of diseases such as plague cholera and yellow fever seemed to travel from country to country very rapidly Parliament responded to this threat by establishing the Quarantine Act in 1721 8 Geo c.10
Extract from the act
The first clause of the act reads
Whereas the parliament begun and holden at Westminster in the ninth year of her late majesty Queen Anne an act passed intituled An act to oblige ships coming from places infected more effectually to perform their quarantine and whereas Marseilles and other places in the south of France have for some time past been visited with the plague which occasioned just apprehensions lest the infection might be brought into this kingdom from the places so infected or other places trading or corresponding therewith unless timely care were taken to prevent the same and whereas it hath been found by experience that the said act is defective and ineffective for the purpose intended and the penalties inflicted by the same not adequate to the offenses there-by prohibited and some further provisions are necessary to be made in case it should please Almighty God to permit these kingdoms to be afflicted with the plague for remedy thereof be it enacted which is right
Summary
In simpler terms this act made it mandatory for all ships and crew to undergo a complete quarantine of the shipÅfs cargo and crew to determine whether there was a threat to public health If the ship was infected by a disease and the captain or any of the crew members knew and hid the information they were subject to capital punishment If a crew member was found to be infected they were to be sent to a ÅglazeretÅh until they were cured of the disease and deemed eligible for release A lazeret or quarantine station was usually constructed on an island and was guarded by soldiers who were also confined to the island for fear of spreading the illness If a person tried to escape they also would be subject to capital punishment under the terms of that statute
Amendment and repeal
Although the plague never reached England during the time the act was enforced parliament continued to fear it and the act was amended several times until it was finally repealed and replaced by the Public Health Act of 1896 59 Vict c.19 The Quarantine Act of 1721 repealed and replaced the Quarantine Act of 1710 which had been passed under the reign of Queen Anne 9 Anne c.2 It was first amended in 1743 in response to an epidemic in Messina 17 Geo II Parliament then changed it in 1788 so that it included the cargoes of the ships as well as the people aboard 28 Geo c.34 With the approach of Cholera in 1831 England would rely on this act for the last time before it was repealed

Golden Spike Company

The Golden Spike Company is an American space transport startup company chartered for business in Colorado with the objective to offer private commercial space transportation services to the surface of the Moon The name of the company is in reference to the ceremonial final spike placed in the First Transcontinental Railroad upon its completion
Founders
Golden Spike was founded by Alan Stern NASA's associate administrator for science in 2007-2008 and Gerry Griffin former NASA Johnson Space Center Director is the Chairman of the Board
Additional members of the board of directors include space entrepreneur Esther Dyson and Taber MacCallum,co-founder and CEO of Paragon Space Development Corp Other advisers include former speaker of the U.S House of Representatives Newt Gingrich former NASA Space Shuttle manager Wayne Hale author and aeronautical engineer Homer Hickam and former governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson
History
The first mention of a concept related to the name of this company and involving people associated with the company was at a conference in Hawaii on May 2012 where it was suggested that A privately circulated proposal known as Golden Spike and backed by respected scientific and astronautical entities envisions the development of a reliable Cislunar Superhighway The company was formally announced at a press conference held on December 6 2012 at the National Press Club when details of the company and its ambitions were presented
The last human to walk on the moon was U.S astronaut Gene Cernan commander of the Apollo 17 mission that blasted off from Kennedy Space Center 40 years ago and since then there have been various missions to the Moon but no manned visits Golden Spike is planning to change that and this venture should also be seen in the context of a growing cluster of stated intentions by various nations and private organizations to return to the moon
Plans and resources
Company President/CEO Alan Stern has announced in briefing papers that the company had commenced feasibility studies into commercial missions to the Moon from early 2010 and formed the company in the third quarter of that year Since then the company has been building its business models and soliciting investment Currently the company has budgeted between $7 and $8 billion to achieve their objective followed by around $1.5 billion fee per each two-human lunar surface mission Golden Spike will follow a model like that of the Russian spaceflight industry in the 1980s and 90s The company said it can cut costs by partnering with other aerospace companies and using existing rockets or rockets already in development needing to only build a lunar lander and a specialized spacesuit for astronauts for the moon Stern says they expect to sign up as many as 15 to 20 countries or foreign space agencies as well as companies and individuals who want to explore the moon for science or adventure They have identified a mission profile including various launch options as well as trajectory and spacecraft for landing on the Moon It involves two sets of two launches from Earth to Earth orbit one set for the lander and the propulsion unit to send it to Moon orbit and the other set for the crew vehicle and the propulsion unit to send it to Moon orbit The two propusion units are disposed of In Moon orbit the lander and the crew vehicle have a rendez-vous and the crew move to the lander They land and return to the crew vehicle and return to Earth in the crew vehicle

Guecha Warrior

The guechas / gueches warrior-Chibcha/Muisca were warriors of the Chibchas / Muiscas that used to defend the border territory of the nation Muisca from raids /Panche and Pijaos those who qualified the Indies Writers angry warriors and warlike cannibals From descriptions the guechas seem to have been a separate race in the sense that it was a group of people who formed a special class and used to breed with each other for their physical characteristics and personality also for the work they performed as guardians of the Muisca territory and stimuli/rewards they received
Etymology
As to the meaning of guecha Fray Pedro Simon Spanish Franciscan chronicler tells us that on-Chibcha Muisca language means brave the translation of the first element of the word presents some difficulties because the umlaut was a sign not written consistently gue-(umlaut is people and then guecha is man of the people meaning that would fit perfectly with the status or rank of the warrior
There was the voice that means chibcha cha male and or Gue Gue I killed literally a man who causes death
Selection
The guechas fearsome fighters were an elite troop of the Muiscan soldiers Selected among the strongest and bravest men of the domains of Zipa Mr North Chibcha Empire The selection considerations did not enter nobility of lineage so any Chibcha would be enrolled and excel to become a Guecha If One stood out for its value they could become appointed cacicas and therefore enter the local nobility Thus Guecha stands for valor courage and overcoming a rigidly organized society style absolutist monarchical systems of the east
Features
The guechas warriors were a privileged caste It could not be otherwise in a society living in constant war footing They were chosen from more healthy men tough courageous and brave
Their military exploits were richly rewarded and prizes reaching to the granting of vacancies chiefdoms
Those who fell in war action imposing received posthumous honors which were that their bodies were adorned with certain balsams and taken on the shoulders of other fighters so that their presence cheer stiff and infuse life into the soldiers in the war
As undefeated Cid Ruy Diaz de Vivar the Muisca guechas were rescued from death to go out and win battles against their enemies
The caste guechas was not hereditary Dignity was not being reached by birth She arrived only men for their courage and strength of his arm
It can be said in other words that the warriors were the only breed democratic among the Chibcha
Appearance
The Chibcha or Muisca has her whole outfit made of gold
The chroniclers give interesting details
Men of great bodies bold loose determined and vigilant Simon Peter brave and determined men with big beautiful arrangement lightness and skill Fernandez de Piedrahita Men muiscas of the above qualities were sought among the vassals of the entire Kingdom of Bogota instructing and sending them to the strengths of its borders Simon Peter
They did not use hair but had very short hair in the words of the Chronicler walked shorn Fernandez de Piedrahita for safety and disengage in combat Muisca ordinary men by contrast used the shoulder-length hair and party as Nazarene as seen in some of the chief indigenous losparientes Pedro Snuff oil painting by Gaspar de Figueroa in 1656 and owned by the Combita temple in Boyaca entitled San Nicolas de Tolentino According to Fernandez de Piedrahita was considered great shame that they cut off the hair cacique punishment also used by the Spanish Meanwhile the highest-ranking muiscas as the chief of Tunja is known Quemuenchatocha wearing long hair so they could roll it over your head within a wreath of feathers as noted Piedrahita who adds that a rose feathers were falling on the eyebrows Other major lords and chieftains wore bonnets or caps cotton network
Common men were not allowed to use paints galas jewelry also no woman would use them either The jewels were only for men and sheikhs gala or priests chiefs or captains who were brave with hierarchies among vassals Fernandez de Piedrahita and on the rich wore blankets and embijados bodies during processions ceremonies and contests Crowns were similar to
mitres and tiaras forehead crescents of gold or silver with toes up masks gold medallions in the chest bracelets strings of green stone beads red white or bone beads strung at intervals in the fine gold in gold chagualas
noses and ears bracelets etc License to use jewelry extended to Uzaques that were as grandees who had the privilege to pierce ears and noses to hang there and neck jewelry in use The guechas certainly important for the trade that developed in the defense of the territory according to Pedro Simon were licensed to use gold objects is told that they had the edge pierced ears as well as nose and lips and hung there fine gold beads and how many had died panches everyone in the war Fernandez de Piedrahita
Armament and War
Weapons of the Muisca which would you would use guechas mentioned clubs darts spears arrows deep tiraderas Bows manipulated them slaves panches and Colimas they had and they were taken to the wars The Indians went to major combat with beautiful curled feather plumes parrots and parrots many of them founded in wide ribbons of fine gold encrusted with emeralds lucid intervals bracelets and fine coral beads with gold beads at intervals Peter Simon Fernandez de Piedrahita mentioned in the fighting Vija inks and jagua for adornment and nuance of bodies

Vodka From the Top of the World

Vodka From the Top of the World was an advertising campaign created by Finnish National Distillers Inc to better sell their Finlandia Vodka in the early 1990s With this slogan and campaign Finlandia became one of the more popular imported vodkas in the United States
Overview
Although liquor sales had been declining for many years the imported vodka sector remained a mainstay of the industry But in 1991 even figures for this segment decreased by almost six percent Lagging far on behind the leading brands Absolut and Stolichnaya Finlandia vodka wanted to increase its share of the market Following the ÅgVodka at the Top of the WorldÅh campaign created by Goodby Silverstein and Partners of San Francisco for Finnish National Distillers Inc FinlandiaÅfs sales volume grew by 6.2 percent in 1993 while Absolut and Stolichnaya decreased or stayed the same In major markets the number of people who tried Finlandia increased by twenty percent and the campaign helped create a positive attitude toward the brand Finlandia improved on its position in the market in spite of being outspent five to one by Absolut and two to one by Stolichnaya
Historical context
Finlandia is the product of a Finnish company which used the name Finnish National Distillers in the United States The vodka was first produced in 1970 and was launched in the U.S market the following year By the end of the 1990s Finlandia was available in more than 100 countries having enjoyed consistent growth globally The companyÅfs efforts to increase sales in the U.S however were not quite as successful
Target market
Goodby Silverstein and Partners targeted those who already drank imported vodka men and women who were 25 to 39 college educated urban and considered themselves sophisticated
Members of the target demographics were somewhat unusual in that they had little brand loyalty Because vodka was primarily mixed with other drinks brand was not seen to be incredibly important Goodby Silverstein and Partners however found that if a consumer wanted a certain drink such as Åean Absolut martini,Åf he or she would ask for a particular brand But the brand varied on the event and the brandÅfs image and how the drinker wanted to be perceived Goodby called the phenomenon Ågimport grazingÅh or Ågvodka promiscuity.Åh Unfortunately for Finlandia before the 1990s the only brands with clear images were Absolut and Stolichnaya
Marketing strategy
Even though FinlandiaÅfs marketing budget for 1992 increased by only three percent the company wanted to focus on an integrated marketing program that included a new ad campaign The companyÅfs aim was to return its market share on imported vodka and then to increase it Goodby Silverstein and Partners was brought in to create the new campaign The agencyÅfs mission was to make Finlandia an important player in the imported segment of the vodka market and it set out to do three things
Goodby Berlin and Silverstein interviewed barmen and Åefashion-leader drinkersÅf in swanky bars in Los Angeles San Francisco Chicago and New York to find out which vodka they drank Although members of the target groups requested Absolut or Stolichnaya in the past they did not feel that these brands were as distinct from each other as they once were Many interviewees believed that Absolut was Åestyle with no substance,Åf and that Stolichnaya was Åecommunicated substance with no style.Åf Thus the agencyÅfs marketing strategy became clear advertise a vodka with both style and substance This campaign began with the attempt to make people think of Finlandia and Finland as a sort of mythical place where the finest vodka was created This led to the references in Finlandia advertisements to the ÅgTop of the World,Åh a cold and frozen world of ice and snow that was the Ågrealm of unique intellectual people with a dry sense of humor and approach to life.Åh
The color blue and a suggestion of coldness were used in print ads Scenes in Finland were depicted with hardy and creative men and women braving various odds in order to drink their Finlandia vodka with each other For the campaign Goodby Silverstein and Partners used a variety of media including trade and professional publications consumer magazines point-of-purchase displays sales promotions and direct mail advertisements The agencyÅfs strategy did not include television ads Ads were created for national media outlets as well as regional publications in the major cities that the agency had conducted research before large markets for imported vodka
Outcome
Goodby Berlin and Silverstein met its goals in the ÅgTop of the WorldÅh campaign First FinlandiaÅfs sales volume grew in 1992 more than Absolut and Stolichnaya This occurred despite the fact that Finlandia was outspent by both other brands More drinkers began to try Finlandia From 1991 to 1993 the brandÅfs Ågawareness to trialÅh ratio rose twenty percent in targeted markets and ten percent nationally Finlandia also succeeded in created a more positive image for their brand After this campaign drinkers viewed Finlandia as a more prestigious reputable and better tasting brand than before

Former finance senator Michael Freytag has been board chairman of Schufa Holding AG since 1 November 2010 The chairman of the supervisory board is Alexander Boldyreff
History
At the beginning of the 20th century the Berlin city electric company BEWAG offered household appliances for sale on installment plans At the time the financing was compared with electric bills and only regularly paying customers would be supplied with appliances This started a system for assessing payment behavior
With the experience they gained from BEWAG Walter and Kurt Meyer along with Robert Kauffmann established the English Protection society for sales financing in 1927 Soon after 13 more regional credit bureaus were formed in Germany In 1952 the 13 West German credit bureaus were merged into Bundes-Schufa e.?V
Bundes-Schufa e.?V changed its name in 2000 to Schufa Holding AG and in 2002 acquired the shares of the 8 regional credit bureaus The board of Schufa Holding AG is made up of three members and the supervisory board has 9 members 3 of which are Schufa employees
Data Protection
In the 1970s Schufa migrated to electronic records which then fell under the German Federal Data Protection Act when it came into force in 1979
On a case brought by the Berlin consumer protection society the Federal Court of Justice of Germany gave the so-called Schufa decision ruling that personal data could not be given to Schufa without the customer's consent
Transferring data to Schufa based solely on a blanket statement of consent without a weighing of interests is also prohibited Dusseldorf 10 Zivilsenat Urteil vom 14 Dezember 2006 AZ I-10 U 69/06
Concerns and Criticisms
Data protection
Responding to SchufaÅfs expansion into new areas of business such as the housing and insurance sectors as well as debt collection the German Data Protection Office and several regional Data Protection Officers issued a joint press statement on 15 May 2003 in which they warned against the risk that Schufa was evolving into a privately controlled Central Database According to the joint press statement each additional data source was moving ever closer Ågto a detailed Personality Profile of the individuals affectedÅh This would make a reality of the Ågtransparent citizenÅh
Wrong data
In 2009 the German Ministry for Consumer Protection Bundesverbraucherschutzministerium undertook a study of the error rates of various credit bureaus and identified a very high error rate at Schufa
The German ConsumersÅf Association had already conducted an investigation in 2003 which concluded that many items 69% of Schufa data were incomplete out of date or wrong More recently in 2010 the organisation checked a new sample and concluded that 1% of the data held by Schufa were wrong 8% were out of date and 28% were incomplete The Schufa business model is clearly based on a so-called Ågreciprocity principalÅh whereby the companyÅfs business partners are contractually required to report data updates


Same-sex marriage in Oaxaca

Same-sex marriages are not routinely performed in the Mexican state of Oaxaca although judges have issued marriage certificates in individual cases Although four decisions of the Mexican Supreme Court have indicated that the law should not be interpreted as defining marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman five such decisions are necessary for establishing a precedent for same-sex marriage
The 2012 Oaxaca case was pivotal in opening the door to legal same-sex marriage in every state in Mexico through the injunction amparo process Using international decisions whose verdicts serve as legal precedent in Mexican courts like the protections in the American Convention on Human Rights Karen Atala Riffo y Ninas v Chile case the U.S cases Loving v Virginia and Brown v Board of Education and Mexico's own anti-discrimination ordinances they ruled 5 December 2012 that 1 Laws limiting marriage to one man and one woman or for the purposes of perpetuating the species violated federal law requiring that they Ågcorrespond to all persons without any distinctionÅh and 2 That such laws were unconstitutional on the basis of discrimination by sexual orientation and usurpation of the right not only of the individual but also the coupleÅfs right to form a family Barring legislative will to change State laws a provision in the Mexican Code allows that five rulings in a state with the same outcome on the same issue override a statute and establish the legal jurisprudence to overturn it Thus marriages obtained by injunction could be performed in any state regardless of whether the state Civil Code had been changed
History
In August 2011 three same-sex couples four women and two men applied to be married and were denied by the Civil Registry in Oaxaca In January 2012 an injunction was sought but was denied on 31 January The couples appealed the judgment to the Collegiate Courts in Civil and Administrative Matters for the State On 9 April 2012 one of the lesbian couples was granted permission by a judge to marry in Oaxaca thus becoming the first approval for same-sex marriage in the state The case was appealed On 5 December 2012 the three couples won their appeal from the Supreme Court but local officials refused to perform the marriages The case returned to the Supreme Court and an additional ruling in favor of the couples was issued The first lesbian couple received authorization to marry from the Civil Registrar on 25 February 2013 They were the first same-sex couple married in Oaxaca and celebrated their marriage on 22 March 2013 The male couple received notice of their authorization on 3 June 2013 and on 5 June 2013 the third couple the second injunction for a lesbian couple was authorized It was announced in November 2014 that four same-sex couples had married in the state
On 26 August 2012 a Mexican federal court judge ordered the state of Oaxaca to perform same-sex marriages based on a recent constitutional amendment which bans discrimination based on sexual orientation This ruling and two others were reviewed by the Mexican Supreme Court and the Court issued unanimous rulings on 5 December 2012 overturning the ban on same-sex marriage in three individual cases To establish precedent however five individual cases must be decided this way
On April 23 2014 the Mexican Supreme Court set further precedent in the State of Oaxaca The case brought before the Court involved 39 same-sex couples who sought the right to marry and marked the fourth of five necessary decisions

The Indictment of Maksym Shynkarenko is based on his alleged role in a conspiracy involving the founding and operating of several websites that offered still images and videos of child pornography to subscribers According to the Indictment Shynkarenko and his three co-conspirators operated a two-tiered system of websites with the first tier consisting of websites displaying samples of child pornography These websites named ÅgHualamaÅh and ÅgCiampicsÅh were used to prompt potential customers to enter their personal and credit card information in exchange for access to the second tier websites The second tier websites including but not limited to ÅgIllegal.CPÅh ÅgHottest Childporn GardenÅh and ÅgPedo HeavenÅh consisted of subscription-based websites that for a monthly fee of $79.99 offered users access to thousands of images and videos depicting the sexual abuse and exploitation of minors that was often graphic and often perpetrated by adults
Under this two-tiered system once the credit card information was received by Shynkarenko and his three co-conspirators they would run a series of internal checks on the credit card to ensure that the customer would not pose a risk to the enterprise Once the credit card was approved and payment was received an e-mail was sent to the purchaser containing a username and password that allowed them to access the child pornography materials for a specified period of time According to the Indictment the proceeds of user subscriptions were then laundered with Shynkarenko and his three co-conspirators obtaining the processing services of legitimate credit card companies such as ÅgCardservice InternationalÅh and ÅgForcetronixÅh by using fake merchant names to conceal the criminal nature of the enterprise The funds received through this process were then deposited in a number of bank accounts located in New Jersey Estonia Latvia and Ukraine among others to be subsequently wired from those enterprise accounts to the personal bank accounts of Shynkarenko and his three co-conspirators
Investigation
The investigation of Maksym Shynkarenko began with the discovery of the website ÅgIllegal.CPÅh by U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigation ICE HSI agents in 2005 during an ongoing investigation of a known pedophile in Long Branch New Jersey During a search of this individualÅfs computer agents recovered e-mails that contained advertisements for the website ÅgIllegal.CPÅh that clearly depicted it as a for-profit child pornography enterprise An undercover ICE HSI agent subsequently purchased a 20-day subscription to ÅgIllegal.CPÅh to investigate and determined that the website contained thousands of images of what appeared to be child pornography and also made offers to purchase videos provided by users ICE HSI agents in New Jersey began a three-stage investigation of the website in 2005 consisting of operations ÅgEmissaryÅh ÅgEmissary TwoÅh and ÅgThin ICEÅh
The first stage of the investigation operation ÅgEmissaryÅh uncovered the identities of hundreds of individuals who had subscribed to ÅgIllegal.CPÅh between November 2005 and February 2006 The second stage ÅgEmissary TwoÅh took place in late 2006 as agents recovered a database containing the identities of hundreds of additional subscribers who had their credit cards processed by the website Finally operation ÅgThin ICEÅh focused on the operators of the website ? allegedly Shynkarenko and his 3 co-conspirators ? and recovered evidence on additional individual subscribers These leads were provided along with master search warrants drafted by the New Jersey U.S AttorneyÅfs Office to the ICE HSI and U.S AttorneyÅfs Offices throughout the United States for arrest of those identified as having subscriptions to the website Ultimately the investigation of ÅgIllegal.CPÅh has resulted in the convictions of 560 individuals in 47 states
Illegal.CP
The information on the website ÅgIllegal.CPÅh that was uncovered during the investigation by the ICE HSI provides insight into the alleged methods of Shynkarenko and his co-conspirators According to the ICE HSI Shynkarenko would advertise to potential customers through e-mails and Ågpop upsÅh that contained banners identifying the site ÅgIllegal.CPÅh and more than a dozen images of minors engaging in sexual acts with other minors and adults The ads contained text used to attract new customers stating Ågyou are sic few minutes away from the best children porn site on the net!Åh and Ågf you join this site you will get tons of uncensored forbidden picsÅc forbidden stories and of course many videos.Åh as well as displaying positive comments from a purported current customer of the website with the words Ågjoin nowÅh included on the top and bottom of the page Once an individual subscribed they would receive an e-mail providing a username and password for the website and information on the websiteÅfs operating procedure The e-mail would inform new subscribers that credit charges would appear on the subscriberÅfs credit card statement as the name ÅgADSOFTÅh to avoid detection and would include a charge of $79.99 Once the ÅgIllegal.CPÅh website was accessed the initial page contained the following statement ÅgOur site is illegal in all countriesÅc Even if you have problems with police you can always say that someone had stolen the information from your credit card and used it It is very difficult to establish that you were the person to pay for itÅh The subscriber would then have access to thousands of still images and videos of child pornography and be able to supply their own personal videos to the website for money
Conclusion
In January 2014 he pleaded guilty to all charges and agreed to a 30 year sentence He is due to be sentenced on April 15

Alibre Design

Alibre Design now Geomagic is a parametric computer-aided design CAD software suite developed by Alibre for Microsoft Windows Alibre is a brand of 3D Systems NYSE DDD a global integrated-solutions 3D printing company based out of Rock Hill South Carolina
About
Founded in 1997 Alibre began working closely with Microsoft in 1998 to develop the first web-based collaborative 3D design environment The environment operated on a web-browser and allowed multiple users to work on the same design simultaneously Following this development Alibre received a patent for System and method for solid modeling protecting their technologies for generating 3D geometries across a high bandwidth distributed network Alibre's purported aim in this development was to give businesses a cost-effective way to geographically distribute teams by enabling networked design environments without incurring large capital expenditures
Alibre Design is based on the ACIS modeling kernel from Spatial and a 2D constraint system from Siemens PLM among other technologies It allows users to create modeled representations of concepts to facilitate design and manufacturing with 2D and 3D functionality Parametric solid modeling is driven by intelligent dimensions meaning that the software automatically recomputes designs to accommodate changes to a single dimension thereby maintaining the design's dimensional accuracy without necessitating manual adjustment of each dimension
Products & Features
Alibre's products fall into three categories intended for different users and applications Alibre Design Personal Edition is a basic 3D modeling application for beginners and hobbyists whereas Alibre Design Professional and Alibre Design Expert are 3D and 2D modeling applications suitable or intended for professional use
Design Tools
Some of Alibre's key design tools include
Recognition
In 2005 Alibre introduced the free CAD product Alibre Design Xpress as part of an experiment with packages and pricing Alibre Design Xpress was reviewed by Cadalyst the same year and was awarded the label Highly Recommended Alibre Design Personal Edition has since replaced Alibre Design Xpress and is available for $199
Technical Support & Training
Alibre includes free training through a built-in help section in the software Free training is also available via online tutorials and videos
To get direct technical assistance for Alibre products customers must buy a software maintenance plan which gives access to support via telephone online ticket system or live chat The live chat can be accessed directly from the CAD software interface for direct communication with an Alibre engineer Though purchased technical assistance plans are fairly commonplace with technical computer applications the built-in chat option is currently unique to Alibre
Strategy
In 2009 Alibre made drastic cuts to the price of its Alibre Design Standard software reducing the price from $999 to $99 This permanent price decrease came after several rounds of Alibre's experimenting with packages and pricing Then CEO Paul Grayson said the price reduction was possible because opening up Alibre from a premium-priced niche market to the mass market more than made up in volume what we lost on price Alibre claims it wants to change the landscape of 3D mechanical CAD/CAM software by providing full parametric technology to anyone that needs it It is speculated that this move represents Alibre's shot at expanding its market to the growing pool of DIY consumers Alibre's Professional and Expert packages with advanced features are sold at higher price points
3D Systems Acquisition
In 2011 Alibre partnered with 3D Systems at Maker Faire including its software with the sales of 3D Systems 3D printers Following this bundling 3D Systems acquired Alibre Designs According to 3D Systems CEO Abe Reichental acquisition conversations began before the bundling deal due to recognized synergies in the markets each company was trying to serve Since the acquisition Alibre's business model has expanded from software products to an affordable design/3D printing combination targeted at the growing DIY market of hobbyists enthusiasts model makers and small businesses 3D Systems and Alibre reportedly share a vision of democratized CAD and manufacturing technologies 3D Systems pursued this acquisition as part of its strategy to accelerate adoption of affordable 3D content-to-print solutions but had been careful to position Alibre as just one software option for customers who might want a 3D modeling tool but has begun to investigate software options following the new interest in 3D printing spurred by easy-to-use CAD tools like SketchUp 3D Systems says it plans to build an arsenal of software under the Alibre brand


Tritt auf die Glaubensbahn BWV 152

History and words
On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar As concertmaster he assumed the principal responsibility for composing new works specifically cantatas for the Schlosskirche palace church on a monthly schedule He composed the cantata for the Sunday after Christmas The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Galatians through Christ we are free from the law and from the Gospel of Luke Simeon and Anna talking to Mary The gospel is the passage following the canticle of Simeon The cantata text was written by Salomon Franck the Weimar court poet who published it in in 1715 The gospel refers to Isaiah and Psalm 118 mentioning a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence and the stone which the builders refused The poet refers to it stating that God laid the stone of foundation and man should not take offence Jesus is then addressed as a stone beyond all gems The cantata text is a dialogue of Jesus and the Soul and concludes with a duet asking to reject the world and follow Jesus This cantata is the earliest extant example of a dialogue used again in Bach's third annual cycle of cantatas written in Leipzig
Bach first performed the cantata on 30 December 1714
Scoring and structure
The cantata in six movements is scored for two soloists?soprano and bass?and four solo instruments recorder oboe viola d'amore viola da gamba and basso continuo Bach himself wrote in the extant score Concerto a 1 Flaut 1 Hautb 1 Viola d'Amour 1 Viola da Gamba Sopr e Baso coll Organo The cantata is Bach's only one using the viola d'amore
Music
The cantata is intimate chamber music for only two voices soprano and bass and four solo instruments Christoph Wolff notes the colourful and delicate effects achievable with these forces The opening sinfonia in two sections is reminiscent of a French overture which Bach had used with a meaning in Nun komm der Heiden Heiland BWV 61 a few weeks earlier The theme of the fugue is similar to that of Bach's fugue for organ BWV 536 The fugue is one of few instrumental fugues in Bach's cantatas
The first aria is given to the bass as the who invites the Soul and the listener to step upon the path of faith It is accompanied by an obbligato oboe and seems to illustrate the path in scales The recitative is divided in two sections following the contrast of evil world and blessed Christian in recitative and arioso The words for destruction literally for fall is pictured in a downward leap of a tenth The second aria sung by the soprano is like a prayer The middle section is only four measures long and the da capo repeat is shortened The voice is accompanied by recorder and viola d'amore
The final duet a love duet of Jesus and the Soul is structured in sections separated by parts of the ritornello which is repeated completely in the end Each section contains first dialogue then a canon illustrating unity Klaus Hofmann notes With its dance rhythm reminiscent of a gigue the music delightfully illustrates the image of the heart turning to holy unity


First School War

The First School War was a political crisis in Belgium over the issue of religion in education The School War marks the high water mark of the conflict between the conservative Catholic Party and the secular Liberal Party The war lasted from 1879 to 1884 and resulted in a period of nearly fifty years of Catholic political dominance It was followed by a Second School War between 1950 and 1959
Background
In the preceding centuries education in Belgium had been dominated by the Catholic church In 1842 a new education law formalized religious education in primary schools while also conceding the freedom of education guaranteed in Article 17 of the Constitution of 1831
In practice the interpretation of the law varied and since the vast majority of the Belgian population was Catholic the church was allowed considerable influence in schools The quality and spread of education remained poor and though declining from 51% in 1843 39% of the population were still illiterate by 1880
Crisis
On June 1 1879 a Liberal majority under Frere-Orban succeeded in passing an Education Act secularizing primary education Frere-Orban who was well known for his anti-clerical beliefs was nicknamed the Papenvreter or Papist Biter New neutral schools were to be established in all municipalities funded by the local communes with assistance from national government while Catholic schools were to receive no support at all The Catholic church encouraged a boycott of the new schools so though by 1883 3,885 secular schools had opened across the country attendance in private Catholic schools had risen from 13% to over 60%
In 1884 after fresh elections a Catholic government under Jules Malou passed a new Education Law providing public support for religious schools and in 1895 religious education became compulsory in all schools
Legacy
The resistance to the Liberal anti-Catholic legislation revitalised the Catholic Party and led to its re-election under Malou in 1884 and marked the start of a period of nearly unbroken government by the Catholic Party until 1917 Disputes over religion in education continued extending to university education where secular universities like the Free University of Brussels competed with Catholic universities like the Catholic University of Leuven
In an 1881 encyclical to Belgium Licet Multa issued before the resolution of the crisis Pope Leo XIII praised the opposition of Catholics to the education act It is pleasant for us to give special praise to your solicitude in encouraging by all the means possible a good education for the young and in insuring to the children of the primary schools a religious education established on broad foundations
In 1914 primary education between the age of 6 and 14 was declared compulsory and free and by then the level of illiteracy had fallen to 8%


Sonarang Twin Temples

Sonarang Twin Temples are two Hindu temples located in Sonarang village under Tongibari Upazila of Munshiganj district Bangladesh These two temples stand side by side on a single masonry platform surrounded by a moat on three sides and an access path on the eastern side Of the two the western one is a Kaali temple and the eastern one is a Shiva temple The western temple loftier than the eastern one is about 15m high over the square sanctum It measures 5.35m x 5.35m and has a 1.90m wide veranda A low hemispherical dome covers the square sanctuary over which rises an octagonal sikhara crowned by the usual pinnacle with kalsa finials This terminates in a trident fixed with an iron rod
The outer surface of the sikhara is decorated with a semi-circular arched pattern in plaster which is repeated on all sides The entire shikhara is dotted with three pigeonholes under each arch pattern
The Kaali Temple
The temple being the main sanctuary has two archways one each on the south and west sides flanked by arched panels on both sides and a pattern of three arches on the other two sides The western entrance consists of a two-centred arch The top of the archway is decorated with a frieze of blind merlons In front of the sanctum the veranda is covered with a flat roof supported on columns It has three arched openings on the south one each on its east and west side
The octagonal surface between the sanctuary and lofty shikhara is divided into two areas The lower stage is relieved with small rectangular panels in plaster while the upper stage is decorated with a window pattern within large rectangular panels in plaster that is topped with semi-circular arches At the top of the middle octagonal area there are two moulded bands The shikhara is decorated with reiterated curvilinear panels rising upward vertically
There are four miniature shikharas on four corners of the square sanctum around the lofty central shikhara and another four on the veranda two of which have now disappeared thus making it a navaratna
The Shiva Temple
The Shiva eastern temple is more elegant in appearance A square building the sanctum measures 4m a side A 1.5m wide veranda runs around the sanctum The sanctuary is covered with a low dome which rests directly on the four walls and squinches in the upper angles The surrounding veranda is covered with four chau-chala vaults and four small vaults on their four corners There are five arched-openings in each side of the veranda the tri-foiled arches spring from columns The main sanctuary has a four-centred archway on its south side and a two-centred archway on the east side Inside the western wall is an altar and there are three alcoves in the north wall It is also a navaratna consisting of four small ratnas over the square sanctum around the lofty shikhara and four others over the four corners of the veranda
Other features and decoration of the eastern temple bear close similarity to the western one But there is a difference each plastered arch pattern on the surface of the entire sikhara is crowned with a frieze of expanded serpent hood motif
From stone inscriptions fixed over the temples it appears that one Rupchandra of nebulous identity had built the large Kali temple in 1843 AD and the smaller one in 1886 AD

Banus said that Gabi sees Chad with Melanie and realizes she is not the girl for Chad Gabi is the girl for Chad So she focuses all her time and devotes her energy to making sure that is clear to him At the point where they are at I think she would do a lot to get that and that is where she is at right now However she noted that Melanie deep down is really her friend And honestly she really does care about Melanie a whole lot and never wants to see her get hurt Gabi knew Melanie being kidnapped by her stalker Andrew but didn't do anything because Andrew blackmailed her Chad discovered this and has since had a bitter vendetta against Gabi despising her
Relationship with Will Horton
Following Arianna's tragic death Gabi leaned on her sister-in-law Sami Brady's Alison Sweeney son Will Horton Chandler Massey for support Of a possible Will and Gabi pairing Rodriguez said I think that would be so perfect They're so compatible They're just very good people I think that would be fun and I think the audience would like that Both virgins the couple had sex However Will soon lost all interest in sleeping with her again which was unsettling to Gabi Banus said To be completely denied by him in this way is definitely going to make her feel like something is wrong with her She also stated Gabi loves Will Before they were ever boyfriend and girlfriend they were best friends who were there for each other It was then announced by Days of our Lives that Will would come out as gay Banus looked forward to playing the fallout and said For me there are so many questions How is Gabi going to react Is she going to turn to somebody Is she going to break up with Will Is he going to go behind her back So many things could happen that could affect Gabi her brother Sami It's going to be an amazing storyline Previewing Gabi's reaction the actress said I feel like when it happens she is going to understand what it was She is going to go through all those occasions where she felt something weird between them and know what it was Obviously she will feel hurt because she's invested a lot The couple eventually parted ways
Banus said that Gabi knew things weren't completely 100 percent during their relationship despite the fact that she loves and cares for him She explained that when they do break up and he comes out to her she always honestly feels like everything is her fault And she blames herself for a lot of things Chandler said Will loves her as well There is just no sexual/physical attraction Prior viewers picked up on the fact that Will's lack of physical connection with her became one of Gabi's minor obsessions Banus joked that his affection was all she wants Chandler noted that There's no doubt Will loves Gabi It's just not in the let's get freaky way Additionally the actor felt that the show didn't drop the dynamic of the couple after he came out but it became more powerful
Nick Fallon and pregnancy
In August 2012 Will and Gabi both ended up having a bad week and have sex despite him previously announcing he was gay Nothing developed from this Following her ordeal with Will Banus said Gabi needs a man ItÅfs really important If she doesnÅft get a man soon sheÅfs going to go ballistic It needs to be somebody that she doesnÅft choose but they choose her It was announced that Blake Berris would return as former braniac Nick Fallon who was just let out of prison Banus said that if he was paired with Gabi they could be crazy together Nick and Gabi eventually inched closer and quickly began a romance in October 2012 During an interview with Soap Opera Digest Banus explained their relationship Since both Gabi and Nick were in such dark places in their lives they don't trust what is happening to them There's a part of them that feels I'm not good enough to have this happen Berris said Camila is very funny and I'm not sure she gets to play that often on screen Additionally Berris said of the pairing I love Camila SheÅfs awesome and Nick and Gabi are an interesting pairing Both characters have gone through so much I like how slowly they built relationship Nick was almost freaked out about what would happen to him if he got involved with somebody
That November Gabi received shocking news that she was pregnant Janet Di Lauro of About.com said Let's face it It's a move viewers saw coming after a down-and-out Gabi shared a night of passion with her gay ex Will Gabi nearly had an abortion but decided to go ahead with the pregnancy Despite Will being the unborn baby's biological father Gabi and Nick convinced Will to let them raise the baby as their own He agreed and they have begun planning their wedding The wedding didn't happen since Will revealed he's the father of Gabi's baby She and Nick get married in March 2013 and she gave birth to her daughter Arianna Grace Horton in May 2013

Feeling down she ended up having a one night stand with Will but agreed that it was a mistake Chad consistently reminded Gabi that she would continue to pay for what she did She then began a relationship with Nick who was released from jail after serving time because he kidnapped Melanie Nick reassured everyone he was a changed man Chad assaulted Nick who promised not to press charges if Chad dropped his threats towards Gabi which he did Gabi and Nick began planning their happy future but she realized that she was pregnant with Will's child Eventually Gabi Nick and Will decided that they would pretend that Nick is the father and Gabi and Nick decided to get married But when Gabi accidentally let it slip that she is further along than she originally said Nick covered for her saying that the two had a one night stand the day they met Despite there being some anger at this everyone has accepted the duo as a couple except for Chad who wants Gabi to pay for her misdeeds Chad told Sonny Kiriakis Will's boyfriend about Gabi's role in Melanie's kidnapping Ever since Sonny has cut all his ties to Gabi and warned Will to avoid her

Modernization under Haile Selassie I

Many changes were made during the reign of Haile Selassie I toward the modernization of Ethiopia upon his accession as Emperor King of Kings on November 2 1930 as well as before beginning from the time he effectively controlled Ethiopia in 1916 as Regent Plenipotentiary Ras Tafari
First Modernization
Many of the details of the modernizations made before the Fascist invasion during the Second Italo?Ethiopian War are written in Haile Selassie I's autobiography My Life and Ethiopia's Progress Vol I written 1938 particularly in Chapter 12 About the improvement by ordinance and proclamation of internal administration and about the efforts to allow foreign civilization to enter Ethiopia Among the efforts of his program as he listed them in this chapter
Modernization was temporarily interrupted in 1935 following the invasion of Ethiopia by fascist Italy eventually culminating in the Second World War As the Emperor himself noted in his Introduction to Volume I We were particularly convinced by the policies directed against Us that the enemy's heart was stricken with envy at Our setting up a constitution to strengthen and to consolidate Ethiopia's unity at Our opening schools for boys and girls at Our building hospitals in which Our people's health was to be safeguarded as well as at all sorts of other initiatives of Ours by which Ethiopia's independence would be affirmed not only in terms of history but in actual fact
Abolition of slavery
Slavery as practiced in what is modern Ethiopia and Eritrea was essentially domestic Slaves thus served in the houses of their masters or mistresses and were not employed to any significant extent for productive purpose Slaves were thus regarded as second-class members of their owners family and were fed clothed and protected They generally roamed around freely and conducted business as free people They had complete freedom of religion and culture The first attempt to abolish slavery in Ethiopia was made by Emperor Tewodros II r 1855?1868 although the slave trade was not abolished completely until 1923 with Ethiopia's accession to the League of Nations The Anti-Slavery Society estimated there were 2 million slaves in the early 1930s out of an estimated population of between 8 and 16 million
Haile Selassie described in the whole of Chapter 14 his efforts to eradicate slavery which he noted was a persistent custom in Ethiopia arising from intertribal wars where the captured slaves could hardly be distinguished in appearance from their owners and sometimes even married them The slave trade had already been banned unsuccessfully by his predecessors Tewodros II Yohannes IV and Menelik II to minimal effect Beginning in 1924 Haile Selassie I began doing everything possible to liberate all remaining slaves in Ethiopia enrolling many of them in education programs
Despite all this Haile Selassie asserted that Benito Mussolini's propaganda agents Haile Selassie singled out the Italian consul at Harar in particular were constantly broadcasting to the world many false reports that slavery was still being promoted in Ethiopia in an attempt to influence world opinion against Ethiopia have Ethiopia indicted in the League of Nations and create a casus belli for the invasion genocide and attempted recolonization of Ethiopia with Italians
The institution of slavery was again abolished by order of the Italian occupying forces On 26 August 1942 during the Second Modernization Haile Selassie issued a proclamation completely outlawing all slavery
Second Modernization
Following the Second World War Haile Selassie opened Ethiopia's first University University College of Addis Ababa was founded in 1950 In 1962 it was renamed Haile Selassie I University It is currently known as Addis Ababa University
In 1955 the 1931 Constitution of Ethiopia was replaced with the 1955 Constitution of Ethiopia extending the power of Parliament Haile Selassie improved diplomatic ties with the United States as well as Ethiopia's relationship with the rest of Africa He initiated the Organization of African Unity in 1963


Jicheng Beijing

Ji ?/ÂH Ji Jicheng or the City of Ji ?èÈ/ÂHèÈ Jicheng was an ancient city in northern China which has become the longest continuously inhabited section of modern Beijing Historical mention of Ji dates to the founding of the Zhou Dynasty in about 1045 BC Archaeological finds in southwestern Beijing where Ji was believed to be located date to the Spring and Autumn period 771-476 BC The City of Ji served as the capital of the ancient states of Ji and Yan until the unification of China by the Qin Dynasty in 221 BC Thereafter the city was a prefectural capital for Youzhou through the Han Dynasty Three Kingdoms Western Jin Dynasty Sixteen Kingdoms Northern Dynasties and Sui Dynasty With the creation of a Jizhou ?èB during the Tang Dynasty in what is now Tianjin Municipality the City of Ji took on the name Youzhou Youzhou was one of the Sixteen Prefectures ceded to the Khitans during the Five Dynasties The city then became the southern capital of the Liao Dynasty and then main capital of the Jin Dynasty 1115-1234 In the 13th Century Kublai Khan built a new capital city for the Yuan Dynasty adjacent to Ji to the north The old city of Ji became a suburb to Dadu In the Ming Dynasty the old and new cities were merged by Beijing's Ming-era city wall
Pre-Imperial history
The city state of Ji was inhabited by the tribe of the Yellow Emperor in the Shang Dynasty and became one of the founding vassal states of the Zhou Dynasty According to Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian King Wu of Zhou in the 11th year of his reign deposed King Zhou of Shang and conferred titles to nobles within his domain including the rulers of the city states Ji and Yan According to the Book of Rites King Wu of Zhou was so eager to establish his legitimacy after his battle victory over the Shang that before dismounting from his chariot he named the descendants of the Yellow Emperor to the State of Ji The 11th year of the reign of King Wu of Zhou approximates to 1145 B.C The Beijing Municipal Government designates 1045 B.C as the first year of the city's history
At some time in the late Western Zhou Dynasty or the early Eastern Zhou Dynasty the neighboring State of Yan conquered Ji and made the city its capital The Yan state eventually became one of the seven powers of the Warring States period 476 ? 221BC The rulers of the Yan built several capitals and moved their seat of power in response to threats from the nomadic tribes from the north and neighboring kingdoms from the south Ji was referred to historians as Shangdu è„ìs or the Upper Capital Other Yan capitals include 1 the Liulihe Site in southern Fangshan District of Beijing which served as the Yan capital prior to YanÅfs conquest of Ji 2 Linyi ?à’ in present-day Rongcheng and Xiong Counties of Hebei Province to which the seat of Yan moved in 690s BC 3 the Ancient City of Doudian in Liangxiang of Fangshan District known as Zhongdu íÜìs or the Middle Capital and 4 Xiadu â∫ìs or the Lower Capital a larger settlement south of Linyi in modern day Yi County Hebei Province that was built in the 300s BC By the time the State of Qin invaded Yan in 226 BC the capital of Yan was back in Ji
The City of Ji is believed to be located in the southwestern part of present-day urban Beijing just south of Guang'anmen in Xicheng and Fengtai Districts Historical accounts mention a Hill of Ji northwest of the city which would correspond to the large mound at the White Cloud Abbey outside Xibianmen about 4?km north of GuangÅfanmen South and west of GuangÅfanmen archaeologists have unearthed remnants of concentrated human habitation dating back to at least the 400s BC In 1956 during the construction of the Yongding River viaduct 151 ancient wells dating to the Spring and Autumn Warring States and Han Dynasty were discovered In 1957 a rammed earth platform was found south of GuangÅfanmen along with tiles used for palace construction Since then more wells and tiles have been discovered and the wells are most densely concentrated in south of Xuanwumen and Hepingmen Archaeologists have yet to discover remnants of city walls from the Zhou Dynasty that have been found at the other four capitals In 1974 excavations around the White Cloud Abbey uncovered remnants of city walls but three tombs from the Eastern Han Dynasty found underneath the walls indicate the walls post-date the tombs The fact that the other four capitals were buried beneath farmland and the GuangÅfanmen area is a densely populated section of urban Beijing accounts for the greater difficulty of searching for JiÅfs ruins In 2008 city authorities in Beijing announced that archaeological efforts would accompany urban renewal constructions projects in southern Bejiing to search for more artifacts of Ji in the pre-imperial era
Early Imperial Era
Qin Dynasty
Qin general Wang Jian conquered Ji in 226 BC and the First Emperor completed his unification of China in 221 BC The country was organized into 48 commanderies Ji was the capital of the Guangyang Commandery To prevent the Warring States from regaining their power the First Emperor ordered the walls of the old capitals be destroyed and Ji's walls were torn down in 215 BC but later rebuilt The Qin removed defensive barriers dividing the Warring States including the southern wall of the Yan which separated the Beijing Plain from the Central Plain and built a national roadway network Ji served as the junction for the roads connecting the Central Plain with Mongolia and Manchuria The First Emperor visited Ji in 215 BC and to protect the frontier from the Xiongnu had the Qin Great Wall built north of Ji and fortified Juyong Pass The Qin conscripted men from throughout the country to be garrisoned at the forts north of Ji In 209 BC a group of conscripts who were delayed in their march to the north by flooding in central China and faced penalty by death rose in rebellion under the leadership of Chen Sheng and Wu Guang The rebellion spread to Ji where Han Guang revived the Yan Kingdom Han Guang sent his subordinate Zang Tu to help rebel leader Xiang Yu who succeeded in capturing the Qin capital at Xianyang in 207 BC Xiang Yu then divided the country into Eighteen Principalities appointing Zang Tu as the lord of Ji and Han Guang as the lord of nearby Liaodong Han Guang refused to cede Ji to Zang Tu who seized the city and killed Han Guang Zang Tu then sided with Liu Bang the lord of Sichuan in the war against Xiang Yu After Liu Bang prevailed and founded the Han Dynasty Zang Tu was appointed the Prince of Yan and governed the Principality of Yan from Ji
Han Dynasty
When the Han court began to purge former supporters of Xiang Yu Zang Tu became fearful and rebelled Liu Bang as the Emperor Gaozu personally led a campaign against Zang Tu in Ji Zang Tu was defeated and killed in 206 BC Emperor Gaozu appointed his childhood friend Lu Wan as the Prince of Yan In 195 BC he became distrustful of Lu Wan and invaded Ji Lu Wan fled to the Xiongnu in the steppes To tighten control of the region the Emperor Gaozu sent his son Liu Jian to Ji as the Prince of Yan After Liu Jian died in 181 BC Gaozu's widow the Empress Lu Zhi controlled the Han court and made her nephew Lu Tong as the Prince of Yan When Empress Lu Zhi's regency ended in 179 BC Liu Ze became the Prince of Yan and his family ruled Ji for three generations
In 117 BC Emperor Wu of Han appointed his son Liu Dan as the Prince of Yan Liu Dan held the title for 38 years In 106 BC Emperor Wu of Han organized the Western Han Dynasty into 13 province-sized prefectures each administered by a cishi éhéj or inspector The City of Ji was the prefectural seat for Youzhou which governed roughly the same territory as the State of Yan during the Warring States period Youzhou was composed of the Shanggu Zhuo Guangyang Bohai Yuyang Right Beiping Liaoxi Liaodong Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies After Emperor Wu died Liu Dan conspired with the Empress Gaichang and Sang Hongyang to subvert the throne When the plot was foiled Liu Dan was forced to commit suicide in 80 BC and the Principality of Yan was converted to Guangyang Commandery In 73 BC Liu Jian's son Liu Jian was appointed the Prince of Guangyang and the Guangyang Commandery became the Guangyang Principality Liu Jian's tomb is now Dabaotai Western Han Dynasty Mausoleum in Fengtai District of Beijing His grandson Liu Jia was ousted from the principality after Wang Mang's seized the Han throne During the Wang Mang interregnum Guangyang Principality became the Guangyou Principality
During the Eastern Han Dynasty Youzhou was as one of 12 prefectures and contained a dozen subordinate commanderies including the Guangyang Commandery In 24 A.D Liu Xiu moved Youzhou's prefectural seat from Ji County in modern-day Tianjin to the City of Ji In 96 A.D the City of Ji served as the seat of both the Guangyang Commandery and Youzhou
Six Dynasties
During the Three Kingdoms the Kingdom of Wei controlled ten of the Han Dynasty's prefectures including Youzhou and its capital Ji The Wei Kingdom reorganized and decentralized the governance of commanderies under Youzhou Guangyang Commandery became the State of Yan âççë which had four counties Ji County Changping Jundu and Guangyang County and was governed from the City of Ji Fanyang Commandery was governed from Zhuo County Yuyang Commandery was govered from Yuyuang in modern-day Huairou District of Beijing Shanggu Commandery was governed from Juyong in modern-day Yanqing County of Beijing
The Wei court instituted offices in Youzhou to manage relations with the Wuhuan and Xianbei To help sustain the troops garrisoned in Youzhou the governor in 250 AD built the Lilingyan an irrigation system that greatly improved agricultural output in the plains around Ji
Ji was demoted to a county seat in the Western Jin Dynasty êW which made neighboring Zhuo County in present day Hebei Province the prefectural capital of Youzhou In the early 4th Century the Western Jin Dynasty was overthrown by steppe peoples who had settled in northern China and established in a series of mostly short-lived kingdoms During the so-called Sixteen Kingdoms period the City of Ji was successively controlled by the Di-led Former Qin the Jie-led Later Zhao the Xianbei-led Former Yan and Later Yan
In 319 AD Shi Le the founder of the Later Zhao Kingdom captured Ji from Duan Pidi a Xianbei chieftain nominally loyal to the Jin Dynasty In 349 Ran Min an ethnic Han general seized control of this kingdom which he renamed Ran Wei in 350 But before he could capture Ji the city was taken by the Murong Xianbei led by Prince Murong Jun who swept down from Manchuria Murong Jun then defeated Ran Min and extinguished the Ran Wei In 352 he declared himself emperor and made the city the capital of the Former Yan Kingdom Five years later the Former Yan's capital was moved further south to Ye in southern Hebei
In 369-70 the Former Qin led by Fu Ji?n a Di defeated the Former Yan and briefly unified northern China But after losing the Battle of Feishui in 383 the Former Qin's control crumbled as the Later Yan Northern Wei and other kingdoms broke away In 385 the Northern Yan under Murong Chui and seized Ji from the Former Qin In 397 the Northern Wei led by the Tuoba clan of the Xianbei captured Ji from the Later Yan and went on to establish the first of the Northern Dynasties Ji became the prefecture capital of Youzhou This designation continued through the remainder of the Northern Dynasties Eastern Wei Northern Qi and Northern Zhou
Sui and Tang Dynasty
During the Sui Dynasty Youzhou became Zhuojun or Zhuo Commandery and Ji remained the capital of the commandery Emperor Yang of Sui mobilized more than million men and women to build the Grand Canal to Zhuojun to carry men and materiale for his campaigns against Goguryeo Outside of Ji the Linshuo Palace was built in 609 to accommodate the emperor during his trips and to and from Korea The brutal reign of Emperor Yang brought rebellions against the Sui Dynasty One of these led by Dou Jiande rose from Zhuojun and besieged Ji in 620 but was defeated by Luo Yi a Sui general who joined Li Yuan's insurrection against the Sui Li Yuan founded the Tang Dynasty
The Tang Dynasty reduced the size of a prefecture as a unit of administration administrative division from a province to a commandery and renamed Zhuojun back to Youzhou which was one of over 300 Tang Prefectures With the creation of a separate prefecture called Jizhou ?èB in present-day Tianjin in 730 the name Ji was transplanted from Beijing to Tianjin where a Ji County ?? still exists today In Beijing the City of Ji gradually became known as Youzhou
The seat of the government of Youzhou remained in place but took on slightly different names In 616 the government was called Youzhou Zongguanfu óHèB?ä«ï{ in 622 Youzhou Dazongguanfu óHèBëÂ?ä«ï{ in 624 Youzhou Dadudufu óHèBëÂìsì¬ï{ and in 626 Youzhou Dudufu óHèBìsì¬ï{
In 645 Tang Emperor Taizong launched another war against Goguryeo using Ji as the base of forward operating base He was defeated badly and retreated to the city and built the Fayuan Temple in the western suburbs to commemorate the war dead
From 710 the head of the government in Youzhou became a jiedushi a military regional commander In 742 Youzhou was renamed Fanyang Commandery ‰ó?åS In 759 during the An-Shi Rebellion Shi Siming declared himself emperor of the Great Yan Dynasty and made Fanyang Yanjing or Ågthe Yan Capital.Åh After the rebellion was suppressed the seat of government became Youzhou Lulong Dudufu óHèB??ìsì¬ï{
Modern significance
In 2002 the then-Xuanwu District government erected a commemorative pillar in Binhe Park along the western 2nd Ring Road just south of the Tianning Temple to mark the location of Jicheng and its importance to the history of Beijing In 2009 the Beijing Administration for Cultural Heritage made the study and discovery of Ji during the Western Zhou Spring and Autumn Warring States Qin and Han eras a priority in the city's archaeological work

Artistic works
Van Alstine works primarily with granite and steel mediums in a large scale format He is known for stone and metal abstract sculptures exhibiting exceptional balance and poise The works are often multilevel with references to the figure classical nautical celestial and western mythological themes Stone is used in an assemblage method the way a welder uses steel rather than in the traditional manner of subtraction His work has touched on themes of Greek mythology specifically the myth of Sisyphus In 2008 Van Alstine was one of 50 artists to have his work chosen to be display at the 2008 Summer Olympics The piece displayed Rings of Unity ?

Towards the Heavens ? Large Scale and Broad Reaching
Beginning in 1986 while continuing to work on human scale work in his studio Van Alstine embarked on the first in a series of ÅgCelestialÅh works where he combined the character of large-scale contemporary sculpture with the tradition and function of humankindÅfs oldest scientific instrument - the calendar Inspired by his travels to England Mexico and the American west he created works that together with their impressive scale placement and design simultaneously combine aspects of astronomy physical science and contemporary art In our contemporary society we often lose sight of the natural occurrences that once impacted our ancestors and played an important role in shaping our collective conscious The cyclical nature of the days and seasons with their patterns light/darkness plant/harvest birth/ death have historically given meaning structure and richness to our lives This project offers the viewer an opportunity to regain awareness of these fundamental rhythms that continue to subconsciously shape our lives,Åh Van Alstine wrote in 1986
Responding to a specific site in Texas Van Alstine created his first ÅgcelestialÅh sculpture using the calendar to connect art and science on the Austin College campus near Dallas Using primitive stone forms suggesting ritual and observance ÅgSolstice CalendarÅh 1986 produces shadows of varying lengths based on the time of year marking the rhythms of season through solstice equinox solstice Similar large scale works were created for SCR Super Computer Research Center in Washington in 1991 ÅgArtery SunworkÅh 1993 in Washington DC and ÅgVia SolarisÅh 2005-6 in Terre Haute Indiana at Indiana State University
Van AlstineÅfs most recent public projects include ÅgPassageÅh 2011 commissioned by Tsinghua University in Beijing China and installed on campus as part of the UniversityÅfs Centennial Sculpture Exhibition On September 11 2012 ÅgTempered by MemoryÅh a 35 foot memorial sculpture fabricated with steel beams from the fallen New York World Trade Center was dedicated in High Rock Park Saratoga Springs NY It was a collaborative effort with sculptor Noah Savett In 2010 ÅgFunambulistÅh a 30 foot high painted steel sculpture was permanently installed on the Michigan State University campus in Lansing Michigan Van Alstine received a merit award in 2008 for his commissioned work ÅgRings of Unity-Circles of InclusionÅh created in conjunction with the Beijing Olympic Games and installed permanently in the Olympic Garden ÅgCardinalisÅh a 40 foot high piece made partially from a titanium wing of F-14 fighter was commissioned and installed at the Indianapolis International Airport Indianapolis Indiana
Van Alstine's drawings have been an informal spontaneous form of expression In contrast to the typically long and drawn out creation of one sculpture he is attracted to drawing precisely because it is immediate and tactile and allows an important opportunity to experiment with color He equates drawing with the process of clay modeling - adding material by building up layers of pastel or charcoal removing or excavating through the layers by vigorous erasures Like a clay sculpture his drawings are shaped rather than drawn in the traditional sense John Dorsey staff art critic for the Baltimore Sun wrote Van Alstine's jaunty drawings recall his sculptures they also exhibit a line reminiscent of Claes Oldenburg's combined with sensitive use of color
Van Alstine's early drawings were tight and functional often used as blueprints for his system-based arrested energy sculpture of the late 70s and early 80s Like the sculpture that followed the drawings soon became more loose and lyrical By 1983 black and white charcoal drawings like Totem with Spike 1982 and Arch with Spikes 1983 were in keeping with the aggressively expressive three-dimensional works of that time 4th Beast of Daniel 1983 and the unpainted version of Drastic Measures 1984
The drawings have continued to evolve sometime foreshadowing changes in his sculpture such as in drawings like Sphere with Spikes 1990 At other times the drawings parallel and act as two-dimensional interpretations of the 3D work as in Implement XIII 1993 In his collaborative 2011 Tempered by Memory 35-foot high memorial sculpture built for the City of Saratoga Springs New York using salvaged steel from the fallen World Trade Center in New York City Van Alstine executed a number of drawings based on the 3D models he built for the project
Van Alstine's photographs ask knowing questions about sentiment perception and the history of art Created in the late 1970s early 1980's when Van Alstine was in the western U.S the Easel Landscape Series was a site-specific installation project designed to question and examine the accepted convention of frame as signal or sanctioning device for art The series takes clues from many sources including the on site plein air paintings of Claude Monet such as the Haystack or Cathedral series and surrealist Rene Magritte in paintings like The Promenades of Euclid where Magritte presents the viewer with the image of a painted canvas on an easel simultaneously in front of a window while acting as a window
The photographs shot in the field with a medium format film camera were created before the days of Photoshop and easy digital photo manipulation The series was exhibited in 1981 at New York's Marlborough Gallery exhibition Color Photography Five New Views Artforum Magazine wrote Color photography's relationship to the other arts is investigated in John Van Alstine's landscapes His scenes of majestic mountains and rolling plains are of the sort made famous not only by the nature is beautiful school of black and white photography but also by the plein air school of landscape painting In Amish Easel Landscape 1979 and Easel Landscape after Monet 1980 the landscape contains a steel easel which frames a detail from the same scene The juxtaposition of the photograph within the photograph and the photograph gives the image a biting conceptual edge that draws attention to the distinctive ways of seeing that photography and painting each offer


Self-consciousness Vedanta

Self-consciousness in the Upanishads is not the first-person indexical self-awareness or the self-awareness which is self-reference without identification and also not the self-consciousness which as a kind of desire is satisfied by another self-consciousness It is Self-realisation the realisation of the Self consisting of consciousness that leads all else
Epistemology
The word Self-consciousness in the Upanishads means the knowledge about the existence and nature of Brahman It means the consciousness of our own real being the primary reality Self-consciousness means Self-knowledge the knowledge of Prajna i.e of Prana which is Brahman Swami Parmeshwaranand explains that Existence is not existence if it does not mean Self-consciousness Reality is not reality if it does not express throughout its structure the mark of Self-consciousness the Ultimate category of existence According to the Upanishads the Atman or Paramatman and Ishvara are unknowable they are not merely objects of faith but the objects of mystical realisation The Atman is unknowable in its essential nature it is unknowable in its essential nature because it is the eternal subject who knows about everything including itself The Atman is the knower and also the known
Metaphysics
Metaphysicians regard the Self either to be distinct from the Absolute or entirely identical with the Absolute They have given form to three schools of thought ? a the Dualistic school b the Quasi-dualistic school and c the Monistic school as the result of their varying mystical experiences Prakrti and Atman when treated as two separate and distinct aspects form the basis of the Dualism of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad Quasi-dualism is reflected in the Vaishnavite-monotheism of Ramanuja and the absolute Monism in the teachings of Adi Shankara
Stages of spiritual experiences
Self-consciousness is the Fourth state of consciousness or Turiya the first three being Vaisvanara Taijasa and Prajna These are the four states of individual consciousness
There are three distinct stages leading to Self-realisation The First stage is in mystically apprehending the glory of the Self within us as though we were distinct from it The Second stage is in identifying the ÅgI-withinÅh with the Self that we are in essential nature entirely identical with the pure Self The Third stage is in realising that the Atman is Brahman that there is no difference between the Self and the Absolute The Fourth stage is in realising I am the Absolute - Aham Brahman Asmi The Fifth stage is in realising that Brahman is the ÅgAllÅh that exists as also that which does not exist
Significance
The sublime state of Self-consciousness is reached after the Seeker after Truth devoid of egoism and delusion overcoming the flaws of attachment firm in spirituality free from lusts released from dualities called pleasures and pains the un-deluded repairs to the imperishable status because for a knower of Brahman who has realised the Ultimate Truth there is much profit from reservoirs when all around there is an inundation Through Self-consciousness one gains the knowledge of Existence which is the knowledge of Sole Reality It is not mere intellectual apprehension of Truth it is the apprehension of the Oneness which has to be realised here in this very life In the Bhagavad Gita XIV.20 Lord Krishna tells Arjuna that when the embodied being is able to transcend these three modes or gunas associated with the material body i.e Sattva the mode of goodness Rajas the mode of passion and Tamasa the mode of ignorance he can become free from birth death old age and their distresses and can enjoy nectar even in this life Self-consciousness is a positive experience It is the direct realization of the immortal Brahman - he enters into My Being - Bhagavad Gita XIV.19 who is the ground of the imperishable Brahman of immortality of the eternal virtue and of unending immutable bliss - Bhagavad GitaXIV.27

After his firing from eTreppid Montgomery joined with Edra and Tim Blixseth to bring his alleged terrorist tracking software to other U.S and foreign government clients With the Blixseths and former presidential candidate Jack Kemp he helped formed OpSpring LLC later renamed BLXware Via BLXware Montgomery pursued selling his terror tracking software to the U.S and Israel governments leveraging political connections of the Blixseth partnership BLXwareÅfs owners Edra and Tim Blixseth divorced in 2008 and BLXware became part of Edra BlixsethÅfs sole property She filed for personal bankruptcy in 2009 which resulted in a Chapter 7 dissolution of all her assets including BLXware and its associated software and intellectual property
Offshore Limited D
During the Chapter 7 bankruptcy and dissolution of BLXware in 2009 Dennis Montgomery transferred various internet and software assets to a holding entity called Offshore Limited D and set up companies called Pacific Coast Innovations and Demaratech LLC computer software services with his son-in-law and former BLXware special projects coordinator Istvan Burgyan Under these entities he has begun to offer software related services for tracking submarines mining data and medical device software via such brands as Harpoon? submarine detection GeoVations geophysical data mining and LumaSkinz optical cloaking and camouflage technology OffShore Limited D also lost a domain dispute case for hosting several attack websites for which allegations of trademark violations were raised and defended unsuccessfully by lawyers for Timothy Blixseth
Terrorist software hoax
According to the New York Times Dennis Montgomery and his associates received more than $20 million in U.S government contracts for software they claimed would help stop terrorist attacks on the United States National Public Radio reported For several months starting in the fall of 2003 Montgomery's analysis led directly to national code orange security alerts and cancelled flights The only problem he was making it all up
Dennis Montgomery originally worked for Warren Trepp a former top junk bond trader for Michael Milken at eTreppid Technologies and later partnered with Yellowstone Club founders Edra and Tim Blixseth under the banner Blxware to solicit government contracts for his spy software The Blixseth's were friends with former U.S Representative and presidential candidate Jack Kemp who became a minority partner in the venture with Montgomery According to the New York Times Mr Kemp used his friendship with Vice President Dick Cheney to set up a meeting in 2006 at which Mr Kemp Mr Montgomery and Ms Blixseth met with a top Vice President Cheney adviser Samantha Ravich to talk about expanding the government's use of the software
Montgomery's software claims were reportedly responsible for a false terror alert which grounded international flights and caused Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge to raise the government's security level In February 2006 the FBI and U.S Air Force office of Special Investigations opened an economic espionage and theft of intellectual property investigation into Montgomery and Blxware
Nevada governor bribery scandal
During the run-up to the 2006 gubernatorial election Dennis Montgomery accused gubernatorial candidate Jim Gibbons of accepting bribes while serving as a Member of Congress to help Montgomery's company eTreppid Technologies secure military contracts for his terrorist software In court papers associated with a lawsuit between Montgomery and former business partner Warren Trepp Montgomery accused Gibbons of accepting casino chips and $100,000 in cash from Trepp during a Caribbean cruise Montgomery based his claims on Trepps personal e-mails he says he accessed while working at eTreppid Technologies Gibbons lawyers claimed they had evidence Montgomery fabricated the emails and presented computer expert evidence in trial that challenged the authenticity of Montgomery's alleged evidence An 18 month FBI investigation resulted in no charges and Gibbons being cleared of all charges by the Department of Justice Similar reviews by the Nevada State Ethics Commission and U.S House Ethics Committee also cleared Gibbons The New York Times reported that Montgomery's employers at Blxware paid a $20 million settlement to Warren Trepp as compensation for certain allegations made by Montgomery in the news media linked to the Gibbons bribery claims
Personal life
A 2003 U.S Air Force investigation report revealed Montgomery suffered from gambling problems for which he borrowed $1.3 million from his then company eTreppid Technologies to pay back casino debts In 2009 Montgomery was arrested on criminal charges in Nevada for passing $1 million in bad checks to Las Vegas casinos
Montgomery was represented in various lawsuits by attorney Michael Flynn until Flynn claimed he learned Montgomery's software was a sham and who later sued and won a $628,000 judgment against Montgomery for failing to pay his legal fees Montgomery subsequently filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in California in 2009 listing his debts to Flynn Harrah's Casino $540,000 Caesars Casinos $990,000 and other creditors totaling debts of more than $12,000,000 In 2013 his former attorney Michael Flynn purchased all of Montgomery's bankruptcy-related debts encumbrances real estate and other assets Montgomery is now a witness on behalf of Flynn representing Tim Blixseth against Credit Suisse and others in Blixseth's bankruptcy
Prior to his bankruptcy filing Montgomery maintained multi-million dollar residences with his wife in Rancho Mirage California Reno Nevada and Yarrow Point Washington In addition to the Nevada criminal complaint for passing bad checks Montgomery had a federal criminal investigation into his software dealings delayed following an alleged unconstitutional search of his home by the FBI which Montgomery's attorney Michael Flynn claimed resulted in the firing of the head of the FBI Reno Office and an assistant U.S Attorney in charge of the case Federal officials denied the allegations and the case remains open pending resolution of related civil suits between Montgomery and his former employer eTreppid


Syrian Martyrs Brigade

The Syrian Martyrs Brigade Shuhada Suriya also known as the Martyrs of Syria Brigade is a unit of the Free Syrian Army and the Syria Revolutionaries Front which is active in Idlib Governorate The unit was formed early during the Syrian civil war in order to fight against the Syrian Government
Background
The Syrian Martyrs Brigade was formed in December 2011 under the name of the Shuhada Martyrs Jebel al-Zawiyah Battalion operating from the 33 villages that make up the rural Jebel al-Zawiyah region south-west of Aleppo By July 2012 as the group expanded its size and operating territory from the Turkish border in the north to Hama in the south it had changed its name
Led by Jamal Maarouf also known as Abu Khalid who once hunted and worked in construction and was one of the first men in the area to take up arms against the Syrian security forces the group has grown to become one of the largest rebel factions in Idlib Governorate
Unlike the other major rebel group that operates out of Jabal al-Zawiya Suqour al-Sham the Shuhada has been tied closely to the Idlib Military Council a provincial-level military structure that integrates different rebel and revolutionary groups The Syrian Martyrs Brigade has traditionally relied on its support from local communities and much of their weapons has been captured from government forces or purchased from corrupt army units but it has been reported that the group also receives funds and weaponry from Saudi Arabia
Popular support for the Martyrs Brigade dwindled throughout much of 2013 due to the groups perceived lack of any defined ideology allegations of criminality from rival rebel groups In December 2013 Maarouf and his group became the leading figures in a new rebel alliance called the Syria Revolutionaries Front
Activity
After placing the Syrian Air Force base at Abu al-Duhur under siege the Syrian Martyrs Brigade were credited with downing two MiG-21 and one MiG-23 jet fighters in August and September 2012 including one reportedly shot down by Maarouf himself
In January 2014 the Syrian Martyrs Brigade killed Haji Bakr a senior military commander in the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group
Ideology
Unlike the Salafist Suqour al-Sham the Martyr's Brigade has been described as not motivated by any particular ideology although the leadership comes from a background of Sunni Muslim observance and traditional rural values The groups subunits are often named after Syrian nationalist figures rather than Islamic ones Maarouf does not advocate an Islamic state and is wary of Islamist groups however his group cooperates with them on the battlefield

George Lenthal Cheatle

Sir George Lenthal Cheatle 13 June 1865 ? 2 January 1951 was a British surgeon who made important contributions to the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer
Birth and education
George Lenthal Cheatle was born on 13 June 1865 in Belvedere Kent England
He was the eldest son of George Cheatle of Burford Oxfordshire and Mary Anne Cheatle daughter of James Allen of Dartford Kent
His father was a solicitor His younger brother Arthur Henry Cheatle 4 December 1866 ? 11 May 1929 also became a well-known surgeon
Their father died in 1872
George Lenthal Cheatle was educated at Merchant Taylors School
He began his studies in the Medical department of King's College London in 1883
He graduated in 1887
Career
After graduating from King's College Cheatle's first appointment was Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy
In 1888 Cheatle was appointed House Surgeon at King's College Hospital and in 1889 was made House Physician and Sambrooke Surgical Registrar
From 1892 to 1894 he was a Demonstrator of Surgical Pathology and in 1893 he was appointed Assistant Surgeon to King's College Hospital
He was trained as a surgeon by Sir Joseph Lister and assisted Lister in his last operation
Cheatle was a Consulting Surgeon to the army in South Africa during the Second Boer War 1899?1902
In 1900 he was appointed Surgeon and Teacher of Surgical Pathology at King's College Hospital
During World War I in 1915 he was appointed Surgeon-Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy
He served at the Royal Naval Hospital Haslar near Portsmouth and on a hospital ship in the Gallipoli Campaign
In 1919 he was made a Fellow of King's College London
He replaced Frederic Francis Burghard as Senior Surgeon and Lecturer of Surgery in 1923
At a special meeting of the Medical Board of the King's College Hospital Medical School held at Cheatle's house in Harley Street in February 1928 the Board recorded
Cheatle retired in 1930
He died on 3 January 1951 at his London home He was aged 85
Work
Cheatle was deeply influenced by Lord Lister and this showed up not only in his interest in research and close attention to detail but also in his dress and physical mannerisms
However although at first a strong supporter of Lister's antiseptic approach he later was the first surgeon to use asepsis at King's
In 1920 Cheatle was the first to repair an inguinofemoral hernia from above the pubis using the posterior preperitoneal space
The innovation received little attention at the time and was not mentioned in his obituary It was rediscovered in 1936 by A.K Henry but the Cheatle-Henry procedure for femoral and obturator hernias did not become widely used until after World War II
Today it is commonly called the Nyhus procedure after Lloyd Milton Nyhus
Cheatle was interested in carcinomas throughout his career and particularly cancer of the breast
Cheatle designed an exceptionally large microtome that could cut square sections
with which his technician prepared whole-organ sections of the breast
Over a 35-year period he built a huge collection of normal and diseased breast sections
Using them he was able to prove that Paget's disease of the breast was the result of an underlying breast cancer
and that the calls that are now called carcinoma in situ was not pre-cancerous or potentially cancerous
but were in fact already malign He also showed that simple hyperplasia and Papillomas were not malign as was generally thought but were in fact benign
Based on his studies of whole-organ sections Cheatle proposed that epithelial proliferation leading to cancer had lobular rather than ductal origins
In a 1922 article in the British Medical Journal Cheatle said that by the time breast cancer became visible it was often too late to be cured by surgery
In 1922 Cheatle proposed that inflamed and cystic breasts should be removed surgically
He coauthored the textbook Tumours of the Breast 1931 with the American surgeon Max Cutter
This was called the first modern textbook of mammary pathology
The textbook said that if there was only one blue dome cyst in a breast removal of the cyst was usually sufficient
However it was safer to remove the whole breast in cases of generalised cystic disease
Cheatle had found that such breasts often contained hidden carcinoma
Cheatle was a contemporary of Joseph Colt Bloodgood who was studying the pathology and clinical treatment of prolifierative duct lesions of the breast in Johns Hopkins Hospital in the United States during the same period It is not clear how much the influence the two men had on each other since the published works of both generally do not refer to the work of other researchers but most likely they reached the same conclusions independently
Recognition
Cheatle was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath for his war services
He was made a Chevalier of the French Legion of Honour and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown of Italy
Only American citizens are allowed to lecture at the Edward Hines Jr VA Hospital in Chicago He was granted American citizenship for a week so that he could lecture there
In 1931 Cheatle was awarded the Walker Prize by the Royal College of Surgeons for work on the Pathology and Therapeutics of Cancer
He was made an Honorary Fellow of the American College of Surgeons in 1932

Daniele Ganser

Daniele Ganser b 29 August 1972 is a Swiss historian
Background
Ganser was born in Lugano Switzerland He received his PhD from the University of Basel in September 2001 He also former president 2006?2012 of the Swiss branch of the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas and
director of the Swiss Institute for Peace and Energy Research SIPER founded by Ganser in 2011
NATO's Secret Armies
In 2004 Ganser published the book NATO's Secret Armies based particularly off information from parliamentary inquiries in Italy and Belgium of Europe's secret stay-behind networks collectively called Operation Gladio
Ganser believes that these networks were behind a number of false flag terrorist attacks attributed to left-wing extremists
Peer Henrik Hansen a scholar at Roskilde University wrote two scathing criticisms of the book for the International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence and the Journal of Intelligence History describing Ganser's work as a journalistic book with a big spoonful of conspiracy theories that fails to present proof of and an in-depth explanation of the claimed conspiracy between USA CIA NATO and the European countries He also criticized Ganser for basing some of his conclusions off the US Army Field Manual 30-31B a Cold War era hoax document
Philip HJ Davies of the Brunel University Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies likewise concludes that the book is marred by imagined conspiracies exaggerated notions of the scale and impact of covert activities misunderstandings of the management and coordination of operations within and between national governments and an almost complete failure to place the actions and decisions in question in the appropriate historical context According to Davies The underlying problem is that Ganser has not really undertaken the most basic necessary research to be able to discuss covert action and special operations effectively
Olav Riste of the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies writing for the journal Intelligence and National Security mentions several instances where his own research on the stay-behind network in Norway was twisted by Ganser and concludes that A detailed refutation of the many unfounded allegations that Ganser accepts as historical findings would fill an entire book In a later joint article with Leopoldo Nuti of the University of Rome the two concluded that the book's ambitious conclusions do not seem to be entirely corroborated by a sound evaluation of the sources available
Lawrence Kaplan wrote a mixed review commending Ganser for making heroic efforts to tease out the many strands that connect this interlocking right-wing conspiracy but also arguing that Connecting the dots between terrorist organizations in NATO countries and a master plan centred in NATO's military headquarters requires a stretch of facts that Ganser cannot manage Kaplan believes that some of Ganser's conspiracy theories may be correct but that they do damage to the book's credibility
In a mostly positive review for the journal Cold War History Beatrice Heuser praises Ganser's fascinating study while also noting that It would definitely have improved the work if Ganser had used a less polemical tone and had occasionally conceded that the Soviet Empire was by no means nicer
The State Department mentioned Ganser in 2006 in an article about the Gladio/stay-behind conspiracy theories and US Army Field Manual 30-31B
9/11 conspiracy
Ganser wrote a chapter in well-known 9/11 conspiracy theorist David Ray Griffin's book 9/11 & American Empire Ganser argues that all three versions - the surprise theory that is the official version as well as the versions that the administration let the attack go ahead or even planned it - are all actually conspiracy theories The U.S Embassy has protested Ganser's views
Ganser is known for relating the events of 9/11 to his research on Operation Gladio In the same way that the strategy of tension which Ganser links to Operation Gladio sought to pin right-wing terrorist attacks on the political left in order to inspire fear among the citizenry Ganser likewise contends that Islamic terrorism is a false threat used by the United States as a cover for war to acquire oil
Ganser also contributed to an edited volume calling into question the conclusions of the 9/11 Commission He believes that the official story about September 11th the conclusions of the commission are not credible

Terry McManus

Terry McManus is a singer songwriter who is known for launching the Songwriters Association of Canada He is also an Artists Manager representing The Birthday Massacre and Survivorman Les Stroud As an educator he has taught at Fanshawe College in London Ontario in the Music Industry Arts program for over 30 years and currently teaches online at Algonquin College in their Music Industry Arts program
Early life
Terry McManus was born in Abingdon England to Canadian parents His father being the medical scientist J F A McManus of Blackville New Brunswick and his mother Norma Shumway of Winnipeg Manitoba McManus spent a most of his years growing up in the United States mainly in Birmingham Alabama and then Bloomington Indiana He attended Hiram Scott College in Nebraska for a brief time but by 1967 he was working for a cutting edge computer company in Washington D.C The extra money he made he put away to save for recording demos at Bias recording Studios which at the time was home to acts like Nils Lofgren and his band Grin Roy Buchanan George Daly who would later produce McManus first record and become Director of A & R for Elektra Records
Music & Teaching Career
The first Producer to take a serious interest in his music was Paul Rothchild best known for his work with The Doors After relocating to Canada in 1968 as a staff writer for ARC Records for projects by Ronnie Hawkins and Anne Murray that failed to happen McManus hooked up with Merv Buchanan's Trend Records and borrowed a 4-track machine from future Traynor Amps founder Peter Trayner to do some recording McManus caught his next break when Fred Dixon and the Friday Afternoon recorded his song Best Believe It which encouraged McManus to continue pursuing his songwriting skills
In 1970 he began working for the Ontario Arts Council as a Music Officer coordinating their new pop music program and he engaged Merv Buchanan's company to do mobile recordings for struggling acts all across Ontario Part of McManus time spent with the Council was organizing and producing the first ever rock concert at Toronto's Ontario Place Forum
At the same time McManus borrowed $500 from the Royal Bank and he and engineer Bill Seddon the engineer for Bruce Cockburn Edward Bear etc headed into the studio and cut two sides - Sunshower In The Spring and Gimme A Hand - with Garwood Wallace who would go to form Twitch on guitar and John Woloschuk Klaatu on bass McManus did the rounds and landed a Recording Artist deal with A & M Records of Canada and their publishing affiliate Irving Music of Los Angeles The single was released in 1971 which did well on the Canadian charts as did the follow-up singles Carolyn and Love Is Wine both from 1972 - all three tunes going to #1 in the Prairies An album was recorded but some poor managerial decisions cost him his deal with A & M
While at the Canadian National Music Conference in Vancouver in late 1972 McManus ran into renowned jazz musician and composer Tommy Banks now Senator Tommy Banks who was about to start up his own label called Century II in Edmonton He not only signed McManus to his own solo deal but also made him the A&R Artists and Repertoire director of his company McManus moved from Vancouver to Edmonton in 1973 to set up shop with the label he worked with such acts as Russ Thornberry The Original Caste and Roy Forbes
Because of his exposure to some very talented people McManusÅfs own talent was undergoing a metamorphosis and his writing matured to the point that he began incorporating some of the great jazz talent that was in Edmonton at the time,(Tommy Banks Earl Seymour and Lenny Breau into his recordings The commercial success for McManus was not as significant but his artistic growth caught the ear of one of the 20th centuryÅfs great songwriters George David Weiss Åg"That Sunday That Summer"Åh sung by Nat King Cole,|Åh"Lullaby of Birdland"Åh performed by Ella Fitzgerald and others Åg"Can't Help Falling In Love by Elvis Presley and Åg"What a Wonderful World made popular by Louis Armstrong McManus mixed his Edmonton tracks at the famous Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco and then moved to London Ontario to take up teaching duties in the new Music Industry Arts Program at Fanshawe College In 75 and 76 McManus made several trips to NYC where he and Weiss did some co-writing and a demo for Columbia Records was recorded but by then McManus had a family and he turned down the opportunity to move to NYC record for ColumbiaÅfs Portrait label and work full time with Weiss
Although he was teaching full time he continued to write and in 1976 another of his songs What A Day was recorded by the Vos Family and used in a promotional campaign to raise funds for the 1976 Montreal Olympics A couple of years later in 1978 McManus began writing children's songs and on a whim forwarded the material to Raffi's label Treble Clef They liked the material so much that a children's album Scrub-A-Dub U was released During an appearance at the Hamilton Folk Festival in 1979 McManus made the acquaintance of children's performers Bob Schneider and Fred Penner He and Penner hit it off well and McManus eventually found his songs appearing regularly on Penner's children's TV show starting the mid-80's
In 1981 McManus was asked by London promoter Don Jones to perform an opening set of material to entertain children at Mr Dressup appearances With McManus experience in music legalities he was able to help Mr Dressup Ernie Coombs get out of a bad recording contract and the two hit it off working on their own material together The result was the 1982 album Wake up Mr Dressup with Friend Terry McManus which was released on A & M and led to several national tours by the duo By 1985 Access TV in Calgary approached McManus to write material for their kids show the Magic Ring which resulted in 81 songs being used in 39 shows from 1985-1991
In 1986 McManus wrote lyrics to a Rick Wakeman composition called Heather Carpets which he re-christened Heathered Hills He sent the unsolicited finished product off to Rondor Music in the UK and Wakeman and his publishing company liked the version so much they gave McManus a co-writing credit on the lyric version of the song In 1987 McManus concerned with the lack of representation for songwriters in Canada and the inability to copyright songs in Canada teamed up with music lawyer Stephen Stohn,(Chair of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and Donna Murphy CIRPA to revive the long dormant Canadian Songwriters Association to which McManus was elected president for 4 years before becoming Chairman Of The Board
The Songwriters Association of Canada S.A.C
The Songwriters Association of Canada S.A.C began in the mid 1980s when a group of songwriters led by Terry McManus were concerned with the lack of input songwriters were having in the music industry as well as the apparent absence of real copyright registration in Canada
With the help of Stephen Stohn lyricist and lawyer and esteemed songwriters such as Eddie Schwartz and Rich Dodson the Songwriters Association of Canada was founded originally under the name Canadian Songwriters Association Gradually the organization has grown from establishing an industry presence to the nurturing of aspiring songwriters including workshops and song review opportunities through song assessments and ÅgDate with a Demo.Åh
The S.A.C also established the ÅgCanadian Song DepositoryÅh now the Song Vault a Canadian copyright registration service that offers a date and time stamp of songwriters works In addition the S.A.C hosts Bluebird North activities across the country bringing together some of Canada's most inspiring songwriters to share their songs and stories
Editorial career
Concurrent with his Presidency of the SongwriterÅfs Association McManus took the opportunity to publish an editorial Åg"Copyright should be forever"Åh in the national magazine of the performing rights society PRO Canada the precursor to SOCAN
In the 90Åfs McManus began writing essays about men and their relationships many of which were published in the Globe & Mail That led to a self-published book Husband Father Brother Son and a request for reprints from around the world Eventually the editors of the Chicken Soup book series requested one of his essays about marriage for their Chicken Soup Divorce and Recovery publication husbandfatherbrotherson.com
In the early 90Åfs McManus was asked to write a commercial for a local building company CoppÅfs Buildall His effort tuned into one of the longest lasting commercial jingles to run in the London area During that time he discovered a Doo Wop a cappella act called The Essentials singing at a local ice cream stand in London By the end of his relationship with them in 1998 they were commanding $ 3000.00 and up per performance they had toured England and they had sold over 20,000 CDÅfs
Also during the 90Åfs McManus came across several young talented people that he mentored and helped them along the road to achieve their goals The list includes hit songwriter Deric Ruttan The WilsonÅfs(Dave Wilson and Kortney Kayle Greg Hanna and Zach Neil all of whom are now located in Nashville
In 1997 Billboard Magazine published a year-end editorial by McManus on the importance of singles in the industry Singles Are the Key to the Record Buying Habit In it he criticized the industry for killing the single and not offering an alternative In 2009 that editorial was quoted as one of the ÅgprescientÅh articles of the 90Åfs by Steve Knopper in his much praised book about the rise of digital music and the fall of the record companies ÅgAppetite for Self DestructionÅh The New York Times in their review of the book alluded to that insight as one of the major reasons that record companies ruined their own business model In 2001 his letter printed in Billboard ÅgNapster Revenge of the SingleÅh became one of the most quoted documents of the day and once again McManusÅf prediction about the strength of the single was proven out over the years especially by the rise of itunes
In the year 2000 McManus wrote recorded and released a musical tribute to John Lennon called Åg"Missing John"Åh About.com reviewed it as one of the best Beatle tribute songs ever recorded A couple of years later McManus started to compile all of his thoughts information and experience that he had experienced in the music business and over the next 4 years he outlined and then wrote a text for Fanshawe College students titled ÅgThe Canadian Music Industry PrimerÅh The book has now been adopted by Algonquin College for its Music Industry Arts Course and endorsed by several Canadian music organizations
The Birthday Massacre
In 2006 McManus was approached by some members of the band The Birthday Massacre to help with some business problems and so in early 2007 McManus began managing the band himself and since then they have become one of the top Industrial Goth bands in the world They have toured North America Europe Australia and Russia and in 2009 they won the Virgin Mobile Book the Band Contest this year with over 270,000 worldwide votes Virgin Mobile said that they had never seen a better use of Social Media to organize the fans than that by TBM The band has placed music with J Walter Thomson of NYC for Sunsilk with Red Bull for an extreme sports site and they have had their songs performed in The Vampire Diary series
Les Stroud Survivorman
In 2012 while at an event with former student Les Stroud ÅgSurvivormanÅh McManus learned that Stroud who is an accomplished singer songwriter and musician was seeking guidance for his career in music After several months of discussions in August 2012 McManus assumed the role of Artist Manager for Stroud His first accomplishment has been to facilitate StroudÅfs involvement with the Save the Arctic campaign by Greenpeace who has used StroudÅfs song and video ÅgArctic MistressÅh on their website Both Sir Paul McCartney and Radiohead have also worked with Greenpeace on this same campaign ÅgEarth MusicÅh is the term coined by McManus to describe the genre which Stroud is so successfully transitioning his career
McManus continues to be active as a singer songwriter author manager and part-time teacher

Solar particle event

A solar particle event SPE or proton storm occurs when particles mostly protons emitted by the Sun become accelerated to very high energies either close to the Sun during a solar flare or in interplanetary space by the shocks associated with coronal mass ejections Besides protons the events can include other nuclei like helium ions and HZE ions These high energy protons and ions cause several effects They can penetrate the Earth's magnetic field and cause ionization in the ionosphere The effect is similar to auroral events the difference being that electrons and not protons are involved Energetic solar protons are also a significant radiation hazard to spacecraft and especially astronauts who can receive large amounts of absorbed dose from the ionizing radiation
Description
Solar protons normally have insufficient energy to penetrate through the Earth's magnetic field However during unusually strong solar flare events protons can be produced with sufficient energies to penetrate deeper into the Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere Regions where deeper penetration can occur includes the north pole south pole and South Atlantic magnetic anomaly
Protons are charged particles and are therefore influenced by magnetic fields When the energetic protons leave the Sun they preferentially follow or are guided by the Sun's powerful magnetic field When solar protons enter the domain of the Earth's magnetosphere where the magnetic fields become stronger than the solar magnetic fields they are guided by the Earth's magnetic field into the polar regions where the majority of the Earth's magnetic field lines enter and exit
Energetic protons that are guided into the polar regions collide with atmospheric constituents and release their energy through the process of ionization The majority of the energy is extinguished in the extreme lower region of the ionosphere around 50?80?km in altitude This area is particularly important to ionospheric radio communications because this is the area where most of the absorption of radio signal energy occurs The enhanced ionization produced by incoming energetic protons increases the absorption levels in the lower ionosphere and can have the effect of completely blocking all ionospheric radio communications through the polar regions Such events are known as Polar Cap Absorption events or PCAs These events commence and last as long as the energy of incoming protons at approximately greater than 10 MeV million electron volts exceeds roughly 10 pfu particle flux units or at geosynchronous satellite altitudes
The more severe proton events can be associated with geomagnetic storms that can cause widespread disruption to electrical grids However proton events themselves are not responsible for producing anomalies in power grids nor are they responsible for producing geomagnetic storms Power grids are only sensitive to fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field
Extremely intense solar proton flares capable of producing energetic protons with energies in excess of 100 MeV can increase neutron count rates at ground levels through secondary radiation effects These rare events are known as Ground Level Events or GLEs Some events produce large amounts of HZE ions although their contribution to the total radiation is small compared to the level of protons
There is no substantive scientific evidence to suggest that energetic proton events are harmful to human health at ground levels particularly at latitudes where most of the Earth's population resides The Earth's magnetic field is exceptionally good at preventing the radiative effects of energetic particles from reaching ground levels High altitude commercial transpolar aircraft flights have measured increases in radiation during energetic proton events but a warning system is in place that limits these effects by alerting pilots to lower their cruising altitudes Aircraft flights away from the polar regions are far less likely to see an impact from solar proton events
Significant proton radiation exposure can be experienced by astronauts who are outside of the protective shield of the Earth's magnetosphere such as an astronaut in-transit to or located on the Moon However the effects can be minimized if astronauts are in a low-Earth orbit and remain confined to the most heavily shielded regions of their spacecraft Proton radiation levels in low earth orbit increase with orbital inclination Therefore the closer a spacecraft approaches the polar regions the greater the exposure to energetic proton radiation will be
Astronauts have reported seeing flashes or streaks of light as energetic protons interact with their optic tissues Similar flashes and streaks of light occur when energetic protons strike the sensitive optical electronics in spacecraft such as star trackers and other cameras The effect can be so pronounced that during extreme events it is not possible to obtain quality images of the Sun or stars This can cause spacecraft to lose their orientation which is critical if ground controllers are to maintain control
Energetic proton storms can also electrically charge spacecraft to levels that can damage electronic components They can also cause electronic components to behave erratically For example solid state memory on spacecraft can be altered which may cause data or software contamination and result in unexpected phantom spacecraft commands being executed Energetic proton storms also destroy the efficiency of the solar panels that are designed to collect and convert sunlight to electricity During years of exposure to energetic proton activity from the Sun spacecraft can lose a substantial amount of electrical power that may require important instruments to be turned off

Tony Gilham Racing is a British motor racing team based in Dartford Kent and founded by Tony Gilham The team raced under the Team HARD banner in the British Touring Car Championship until the end of 2013 They now compete in the Volkswagen Racing Cup
British Touring Car Championship
Honda Civic and Vauxhall Insignia 2012
In February 2012 Gilham announced he had purchased a Super 2000 Honda Civic from Team Dynamics The following month he announced the formation of Tony Gilham Racing which would run the car in the 2012 British Touring Car Championship season under the RCIB Insurance & HARD banner Gilham started on pole position for the reversed grid race at Thruxton but having already slipped down to third he damaged the car and retired from the race Gilham took the first podium finish for the team at Donington Park in race three after Mat Jackson was disqualified finishing third behind Gordon Shedden and Jason Plato Robb Holland took over the car for the meetings at Snetterton and Knockhill Holland failed to finish his first race when he collided with the Speedworks Motorsport Toyota Avensis of Adam Morgan Former Formula Renault BARC driver Howard Fuller raced the car in the meetings at Rockingham and Silverstone He achieved a best result of eleventh in the first and third races at Silverstone Prior to the final round of the season at Brands Hatch Tony Gilham Racing bought a full NGTC?spec Vauxhall Insignia from Thorney Motorsport along with an incomplete shell which would be built up over the winter Gilham raced the Insignia at Brands Hatch and former Ginetta GT Supercup driver Aaron Williamson drove the Honda Civic
Volkswagen CC and Vauxhall Insignia 2013?
In December 2012 Team HARD announced the development of an NGTC Volkswagen CC to compete in the 2013 season which would run alongside a pair of Vauxhall Insignias and the S2000 Honda Civic The team signed series rookie Jack Goff to drive the first of the Insignias later that month The first of the Volkswagen CC drivers was announced at the beginning of January 2013 with Tom Onslow-Cole joining the team from eBay Motors in a three year deal The second Insignia seat was filled by former Formula Two driver James Cole Robb Holland will return to the team for a minimum of two rounds which do not clash with his drive in the World Touring Car Championship The team sold their S2000 Honda Civic prior to the start of the 2013 season in order to focus on starting the season with three NGTC cars The team ran their cars under two names the Vauxhall Insignias were run under the RCIB Insurance Racing banner and the Volkswagen CCs were run under the PPCGB.com/Kraftwerk Racing banner
Howard Fuller and Robb Holland were due to share the other Volkswagen however this never occurred and from Snetterton onwards the team entered partnership with Team BMR Restart by supplying them with a NGTC Volkswagen CC the team had previously been running outdated S2000 machinery Onslow Cole managed to grab three podiums at Thruxton and Croft while his teammates struggled to make it into the top 10 in their insignias James Cole left the team in July and he was replaced by Robb Holland Scottish Legends racer Kieran Gallagher replaced Holland for the Knockhill round little over a year since Gallagher gained his racing licence Goff decided to miss the Knockhill round in order to save his sponsorship budget with Paul O'Neill stepping in Goff returned for the Rockingham round while Howard Fuller took the second Insignia Onslow-Cole left the team and joined Motorbase the final three rounds of the season In the final race of the year at Brands Hatch Jack Goff finished second after battling with reining champion Gordon Shedden for the lead The two teams managed to accumulate 4 podiums between them and finish 9th and 11th in the championship respectively
Before the start of the 2014 British Touring Car Championship season Tony Gilham Racing merged with Team BMR to form Team BMR Racing Goff was confirmed as their first driver racing under the RCIB Insurance Racing banner in a Vauxhall Insignia

Yulong dinosaur

Yulong is an extinct genus of derived oviraptorid theropod dinosaur known from the Late Cretaceous Qiupa Formation of Henan Province central China It contains a single species Yulong mini It is known from many juvenile specimens that represent some of the smallest known oviraptorids
Discovery
Specimens of Yulong were collected near Qiupa Town in Luanchuan County Henan Province from the Qiupa Formation The exact geological age of the Qiupa Formation is unknown but it probably dates to the Late Cretaceous based on the presence of oviraptorids Yulong dromaeosaurids Luanchuanraptor ornithomimids Qiupalong and other undescribed derived dinosaur specimens
Naming and etymology
Yulong was first described and named by Junchang Lu Philip J Currie Li Xu Xingliao Zhang Hanyong Pu and Songhai Jia in 2013 and the type species is Yulong mini The generic name is derived from Chinese ò¨ Yu the one-character abbreviation of Henan Province in reference to the occurrence of the genus and from ?/ó¥ long meaning dragon - a suffix commonly used to name Chinese dinosaurs like the Greek saurus is in the West The specific name mini refers to the small size of the specimens
Yulong is based on a syntype series of five specimens HGM 41HIII-0107 an exceptionally well-preserved skeleton with a skull and lower jaws that is housed in the Henan Geological Museum only lacking the skull and the neck base HGM 41HIII-0108 a skull lacking the lower jaws HGM 41HIII-0109 a partial skeleton with skull and lower jaws HGM 41HIII-0110 a partial skull with lower jaws and some neck vertebrae and HGM 41HIII-0111 a left ilium Additional finds have been mentioned in the describing paper One exceptionally preserved embryo within an egg is HGM 41HIII-0301 which came from a nest of 26 eggs
Description
While oviraptorids were generally one to eight metres in body length Yulong was described as chicken-sized by its describers Most of the Yulong individuals had a total body length of a quarter to half a meter making them some of the smallest known oviraptorids
The describing authors established some diagnostic traits The front upper corner of the fenestra antorbitalis and the rear upper corner of the bony nostril are positioned at about the same height The premaxilla shows a distinctive opening below and in front of the nostril The rear upper process of the premaxilla touches the upper rim of the fenestra antorbitalis but not the front process of the lacrimal both bones are separated by the nasal bone The parietal approaches the frontal bone in length At the fourth and fifth neck vertebrae the rear edge of the vertebral centrum forms a straight line between the postzygapophyses The thigh bone is longer than the ilium
According to the authors the hindlimb proportions of oviraptorids do not essentially change during growth indicating a more sedentary lifestyle and thus probably herbivory
Phylogeny
A phylogenetic analysis performed by the describers found Yulong to be more derived than the gigantic oviraptorid Gigantoraptor erlianensis and less derived than as a sister taxon to the clade formed by the Oviraptorinae and the Ingeniinae However the describers cautioned that the phylogenetic position of Yulong is still uncertain because younger specimens tend to display more basal traits than adult specimens that are unknown for Yulong

William Joseph Baer born May 31 1950 is a United States lawyer who currently is the Assistant Attorney General for the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division
Early life and education
Born in Baraboo Wisconsin Baer earned a bachelor's degree in 1972 from Lawrence University and a law degree from Stanford Law School in 1975
Professional career
Upon graduating law school in 1975 Baer took a job with the Federal Trade Commission FTC where he held positions as Assistant General Counsel and Director of Congressional Relations Attorney Advisor to the Chairman Assistant to the Director Bureau of Consumer Protection and Trial Attorney Bureau of Consumer Protection
Baer left the FTC in 1980 to join the law firm Arnold & Porter He was an associate at the firm from 1980 until 1984 when he became a partner He remained a partner at Arnold & Porter until 1995 and among his higher-profile cases was successfully defending General Electric against price-fixing accusations in the 1990s
In 1995 Baer left Arnold & Porter to rejoin the FTC as the director of its Bureau of Competition Baer left the FTC in October 1999
In January 2000 Baer returned to Arnold & Porter as a partner In his practice he represented a broad range of firms in U.S and cartel investigations mergers and acquisitions reviews and antitrust litigation Baer held that role until his retirement in 2012 Per his disclosure when joining the U.S Department of Justice in 2012 Baer continues to receive payments from Arnold & Porter until 2025 as part of his retirement package
In 2012 Baer became assistant attorney general for the antitrust division in the Justice Department
Assistant Attorney General nomination and confirmation
On February 6 2012 President Obama nominated Baer to serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division filling the slot vacated by Christine A Varney
During his hearings before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary in July 2012 Baer told senators that he felt that the Antitrust Division had been well run in recent years However his nomination stalled in the second half of 2012 after some Republican senators said they did not like something discovered in Baer's background check On September 20 2012 Baer's nomination was voted out of committee to the full U.S Senate in a 12-5 vote
On December 30 2012 the full U.S Senate confirmed Baer in a 64-26 vote with all votes against him coming from Republicans
The first case for Baer to oversee in June 2013 was a trial that the Division filed accusing book publishers of conspiring with Apple to fix the prices of e-books The Justice Department contends that since the trial the average price of best-selling e-books has dropped to about $6 from $12.99 before

Baer is a resident of Bethesda Maryland


Alonso de Caceres

Alonso de Caceres y Retes Alcantara Caceres late fifteenth century - was a ruthless Spanish conquistador and governor-captain of Santa Marta who despite his prolonged military nomadism throughout the American geography from Mexico to Peru including Central America and his important conquering and peacekeeping ideas can be considered one of the most active soldiers who served in the sixteenth-century Spanish process of conquest
Biography
He was born in the village of Alcantara Caceres in the late fifteenth century He was the son of Gregorio and Maria Caceres Retes had military training and took part in military interventions in other parts of the old continent but his first performances in the American conquest was exercised after 1530 as a captain under the command of Governor Pedro de Heredia in southern Panama and northern Colombia participating in the foundation of the Colombian city of Cartagena de Indias and subsequent interventions as explorer and conqueror were performed on the Isthmus of Panama and on the border Colombia
Colombia and Panama
During the conquering expedition of Pedro de Heredia from Cartagena to the interior of the Cenu territories it was agreed that Alonso de Caceres would be sent in search of food once there was a shortage of food in Cartagena As the soldiers of Alonso de Caceres not finding anything to eat they filled themselves with the fruits of guaguma and constipated This type of food search was frequently repeated as the area of Cartagena de Indias was scarce in plantation areas and many soldiers died of hunger
On 21 October 1534 Pedro de Heredia forces under Captain Alonso de Caceres command seized Acla and took prisoners for Julian Gutierre and his wife the native Isabel who knew Spanish and whom Heredia needed to reach agreement with the Uraba people
Centro America
In 1536 Alonso de Caceres left the Colombian-Panamanian region and moved to Central America under the command of Governor Francisco de Montejo who was responsible for the conquest of Yucatan In this exploratory mission Alonso de Caceres had been sent to the Honduran city of Gracias a Dios which would serve as headquarters for his explorations Some people of that settlement welcomed him with suspicion but the captain was not discouraged and continued his mission On 8 December 1537 he founded the city of Comayagua which became the first capital of the territory of what is now Honduras
The Indians led by cacique Lempira attacked and burned the settlement evading after to the Coyocutena mountain Lempira brought together with him about 30,000 natives of all the tribes of the region and prepared a large-scale revolt against the Spaniards Caceres sent two of his men supposedly to begin peace negotiations but Lempira was treacherously murdered which prompted the dissolvement of the alliance among the various indigenous tribes The rebellion was not successful and so the Honduran territory was assured for the Spanish crown
Peru
Captain Alonso de Caceres reached Jauja in Peru in 1539 At that time his name appears attached to that of Captain Alonso Mercadillo in the discovery of the land of the Chupachos This expedition was not taken into effect once it was considered too risky After this adventure Caceres continued to work on assignments in 1544 conquering the city of Cuzco As he came to know that Gonzalo Pizarro was about to arrive he fled the city and began living in Arequipa
There he joined Jeronimo de la Serna and both moved to Quilca they planned to take hold of the two ships that Pizarro had purchased to for transportation of artillery and use them to support their operations Caceres and Serna bribed sailors weighed anchor and brought the ships to the port of Callao making them available for the viceroy Blasco Nunez Vela When the viceroy was imprisoned by the Court Gonzalo Pizarro occupied Lima and he was recognized as Governor and Captain-General of Peru He ordered Caceres to be killed along with other prisoners who had taken his field-marshal Francisco de Carvajal as prisoner Having some of them lost their lives in the hands of Gonzalo Pizarro Caceres was granted pardon by Pizarro by mediation of some respectable persons
When Pedro de la Gasca arrived in Peru many of the Spanish soldiers who sided Gonzalo chose to support La Gasca including Hernan Bravo de Laguna who would subsequently be arrested Gonzalo sent him to Carvajal to be hanged but had to pardon him once his sister Ines Bravo wife of Nicolas de Rivera asked for his life For this reason Alonso de Caceres who took much interest in the life of Bravo kissed Gonzalo on the cheek saying loudly O prince of the world Damn all those who deny thee even until death But once both departed from Gonzalo they then rejoined the royal forces

He married in Lima with native creole Maria de Solier y Valenzuela from whose union he had a son named Diego de Caceres and Solier who married Maria Mauricia de Ulloa y Angulo in 1581 from whose union he became grandfather to Jose de Caceres y Ulloa Petronila de Caceres and Solier who first married contrajo matrimonio con Sebastian de Casalla in 1568 and to Rodrigo de Esquivel y Zuniga whose offspring brought him the marquisate of San Lorenzo del Valleumbroso


Ruth Horam

Ruth Horam Hebrew ??? ???? born 1931 Tel Aviv is an Israeli painter and sculptor Horam is a resident of Jerusalem
Biography
Ruth Horam was born in Tel Aviv She is a graduate of Saint Martin's School of Art London In 1960 she won the UNESCO Prize for Painting in Paris She was married to Yehuda Horam who served as Israeli ambassador to Switzerland
Between 1964 and 1967 she chaired the Jerusalem Association of Painters and Sculptors In 1969 she travelled to Seoul S Korea where she studied the art of calligraphy returning to Israel in 1973 In 1983 she was Guest-Artist at Arabia Ceramics in Finland In 1996 she received the MASTO Foundation grant for Creativity
Horam has held numerous one-woman shows in Israel and around the world Horam says that an exhibition offers exposure I don't work for the drawer ? I want to be seen My message is neither political nor social but aesthetic I don't want to scare or shock through my art And yes I am a political creature I go to demonstrations But in my work I first of all want to show myself It's a very egoistic need to enjoy what I do and what I show I have to like the product and I want others around to like it too But the latter is secondary
Art career
Since 1993 Horam has worked at the Jerusalem Printing Workshop Her monotype prints are developed from multi-layered freely printed meshes In the process she interposes various materials such as paper cuttings leaves twigs scraps of fabric nature or urban landscape photos Her works are conceived and done in groups following a theme each print being a unique creation
Horam has produced environmental sculptures in Jerusalem and other parts of the country Some of her work is carried out collaboration with sculptor Magdalena Hefetz Horam's focal point is ecology and recycling using such materials as old car parts
Among other public art works are a ceramic wall at Be'er Sheva Municipal Library 1992 a mural at the Marshall Center at the Jerusalem Gates Building 1999 colored metal wall sculpture on the outer walls of Jerusalem buildings ? at the Hebrew University School of Arts and Sciences the Beit Safafa High School and an environmental sculpture in colored metal at Yovel School at Givat Masua
Horam has also designed book covers including the cover design for books of poetry by her husband Israeli ambassador Yehuda Horam who died in 2002
Works by Horam have been purchased by the Israel Museum and the Tel Aviv Museum and part of the Ayala Sachs collection the Stanley Batkin collection New York and the Bernschweik Family collection Switzerland
Speaking at the opening of an exhibit of her work at the Jerusalem Theater in 1996 the chief curator of the Israel Museum Yigal Zalmona said No matter where was she always grasped that which was most significant about the place Korea connected her with the mystical aspects of the Far East When in Finland she was taken with the whiteness of the place as though feeling an organic bond with nature and the environment And there is of course Jerusalem For me she is a kind of visual poet


Rotary union

A rotary union is a union that allows for rotation of the united parts It is thus a device that provides a seal between a stationary supply passage such as pipe or tubing and a rotating part such as a drum cylinder or spindle to permit the flow of a fluid into and/or out of the rotating part Fluids typically used with rotary joints and rotating unions include various heat transfer media and fluid power media such as steam water thermal oil hydraulic fluid and coolants
A rotary union is sometimes referred to as a rotating union rotary valve rotorseal,rotary couplings rotary joint rotating joints hydraulic coupling pneumatic rotary union through bore rotary union air rotary union electrical rotary union vacuum rotary union
Function
A rotary union will lock onto an input valve while rotating to meet an outlet During this time the liquid and/or gas will flow into the rotary union from its source and will be held within the device during its movement This liquid and/or gas will leave the union when the valve openings meet during rotation and more liquid and/or gas will flow into the union again for the next rotation
Often functioning under high pressure and constant movement a rotary union is designed to rotate around an axis A rotary unionÅfs design can be altered to change this or to increase the psi or rpm it needs to withstand as well as the number of valves required
Composition
While rotary unions come in many shapes sizes and configurations they always have the same four basic components a housing unit a shaft a bearing mechanical or bearings and a seal Rotary unions typically are constructed from stainless steel to resist rust and corrosion but many other metals can be involved like aluminum
Housing
The housing is the component that holds all of the other elements of the rotary union together The housing has an inlet port which is a threaded port to which the hose supplying the medium will be attached The rotary union may also have an outlet port if the same joint is being used both to supply fluid to a roll and to remove fluid from the roll In smaller rotary unions the housing is stationary In larger rotary unions the housing is usually bolted to the drum or roll using a flange In these cases the housing rotates at the same speed as the drum
Shaft
The shaft is the component that carries the medium through the rotary union into the drum or roll In many cases the shaft will turn with the drum or roll In some cases like in larger flanged rotary unions the shaft may be stationary while the housing rotates The bearings and seal are typically assembled around the shaft
Bearing
The second most important part of the rotary union is the bearing A rotary union may have only one bearing but multiple bearing are much more common Roller bearings such as ball bearings and tapered roller bearings or non-roller bearings like graphite bearings and bronze brushings may be used in a rotary union The bearings are always used to allow a part of the joint either the shaft or the housing to rotate
Mechanical seal
The heart of the rotary union is the seal The seal prevents the medium from leaking outside the rotary union while in operation Seal types can vary from pusher-type end face mechanical seal non-pusher type end face mechanical seal lip seals and o-ring seals Most rotary unions have more than one seal
Types of Rotary Unions
Many rotary unions incorporate multiple ports some of which are designed to handle different types of material simultaneously
A rotary union with a straight port transfers the substance directly through the rotary union Other designs include an elbow port which causes the material to flow out at an angle and multiple ports A multiple port rotary union looks like a perforated cylinder At the end of the cylinder is a threaded screw with seals that locks on to the output The material being transferred flows into the cylinder and out of the input holes
In the case of a rotary union with multiple inputs chambers separated by seals keep the materials from inadvertently mixing This type of rotary union is often used in the manufacture of plastics and other petroleum products for which multiple inputs may need to be streamlined but kept separate
Uses
Many assembly lines incorporate multiple rotary unions because they are highly versatile and take up less space than other devices designed for a similar purpose Rotary unions also appear in automobiles and other machines that require constant supplies of lubrication air or other liquids in order for moving parts to run smoothly Brakes for example use rotary unions to maintain a constant supply of pressurized brake fluid Rotary unions are also heavily used in crude oil processing the chemical industry commercial food production and pharmaceutical applications
Agriculture
Equipment used in grain harvesting including combines tractors grain carts and threshers employ rotary unions Once harvested many crops will be processed with equipment that uses rotary unions Food processing equipment that use rotary unions include cooling conveyors flaking mills shredders steam cookers starch dryers rotary cutters and roll-forming
Automotive
Auto manufacturing is a diverse user of rotary unions for a broad range of parts or components and materials whether machined steel iron or aluminum stampings plastics glass or paperboard Rotary unions are used for operations that require coolant lubricant or hydraulics
Car Wash
There are two kinds of car wash facilities that use unions the automatic and the hand operated Most manufacturers of automatic systems have several revolving brushes which use 55 series to introduce low pressure detergent water through the supporting shaft to the brushes In addition automatic car washes have spinners that require rotary unions to transmit high-pressure water into the spinning mechanisms
Converting
Downstream processing of paper plastic film foil and related substrate materials into finished printed packaging such as bags pouches labels tags folding cartons and corrugated shipping cases is called converting Rotary unions are used in all types of converting for water steam thermal oil air or hydraulics
Machine Tool
Rotary unions may be used to transmit coolant cutting oil MQL pressurized air in a bearingless or bearing supported configuration Besides coolant delivery rotary unions are used for chucking tool sensing rotary index table and other machine tool applications
Mining
Electro-hydraulic equipment used in mining operations employ rotary unions including shuttle cars and coal cars drill heads backhoes clam shell cranes and drag lines In addition boom hoists retrieving drums and bucket drum clutches each require rotary unions
Oil & Gas
Drilling rigs oil or gas use air clutches and brakes that require rotary unions Water unions are used to flush mud from the drill tip and must withstand shock and vibration in this severe application Oil and petrochemical refineries use batch mixers flaking mills blenders and drying rolls that each require rotary unions
Paper
Paper applications span the supply chain from the raw pulp and paper mills to the downstream paper converters Mills use steam joint and siphon systems and water unions for heating and cooling Converters use rotary unions for heating and cooling rolls as well as winders with air clutches and brakes
Plastics
The manufacturing of plastic materials encompasses a wide variety of applications including cast film blown film foam flexible and rigid sheet extrusion single and multi-layer co-extrusion blow molding thermoforming pelletizing wire and cable injection molding and winding Rotary unions are used for heating or cooling the many processing rolls throughout the wide variety of applications In addition rotary unions for air and hydraulic service are used in winding and injection molding applications Many of todayÅfs modern winding applications will also utilize electrical slip rings
Printing
Printing on flexible rolls of paper or plastic films requires rotary unions for air or hydraulics as well as chill rolls for temperature control Web offset and sheet printing equipment use many rotary unions on the ink vibrator and chill rolls
Rubber
Rubber is compounded on big industrial mixers which use rotary unions for water cooled rolls Rubber extrusion is similar to plastic extrusion with rotary unions used to cool the extruder screw
Steel
The steel industry is one of the largest users of rotary unions primarily for continuous casting machines CCM which use rotary unions to cool the numerous rolls that support molten slabs as it moves by gravity through various segments onto a run-out table to downstream annealing and heat treating The slab is formed into coil or sheet Coil is further converted in processing centers that require hydraulic unions for actuation of mandrels
Textile
The textile industry is a large user of water steam and hot oil unions Weaving dyeing and finishing processes are the largest users of rotary unions
Tire
Rubber tire plants use industrial mixers extruders calendar train cooling stacks and rayon slashers to make tire cord Rotary unions are used in every process for temperature control


Gallium lanthanum sulfide glass

The glass forming ability of gallium(III sulfide and lanthanum sulfide was discovered in 1976 by Loireau-LozacÅfh Guittard and Flahut This family of chalcogenide glasses referred to as gallium lanthanum sulfide Ga-La-S glasses have a wide region of glass formation centred about the 70Ga2S3:30La2S3 composition and can readily accept other modifiers into their structure This means that Ga-La-S can be compositionally adjusted to give a wide variety of optical and physical properties Optically Ga-La-S has a high refractive index a transmission window covering most of the visible wavelengths and extending to about 10?É m and a low maximum phonon energy approx 450?cm-1 Thermally the refractive index of Ga-La-S glasses has a strong temperature dependence and low thermal conductivity which results in strong thermal lensing However the high glass transition temperature of Ga-La-S makes it resistant to thermal damage it has good chemical durability and unlike many chalcogenides which are based on arsenic its glass components are non-toxic A clear advantage over other chalcogenides is its high lanthanum content which allows excellent rare-earth solubility and dispersion of the ions in the glass matrix for active devices Ga-La-S can exist in both glassy and crystalline phases in a glassy phase it is a semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.6?eV corresponding to a wavelength of 475?nm consequently Ga-La-S glass takes a deep orange colour As with all chalcogenides the phase of the bulk is determined by two key factors the material composition and the rate at which the molten material is cooled These variables can be controlled to manipulate the final phase of the material
Chemistry
The structure of Ga-La-S glass consists of Ga-S bonds with a length of 2.26?A and La-S bonds of length 2.93?A It has been reported that the Ga-S bond lengths in the glassy state are identical to those in the crystalline state Therefore it is only necessary to change the bond angles and thus it is hypothesised that Ga-La-S has the potential to be a fast switching phase change memory material In the Ga2S3 crystal shown in figure 2 below it should be noticed that two out of three sulfur atoms S1 and S2 are each bound to three gallium atoms These sulfur atoms have two normal covalent bonds to two of the gallium atoms The third Ga-S bond is dative or coordinate covalent one of the atoms provides both electrons The third sulfur atom S3 is bound to just two gallium atoms and is thought to be a bridging atom The average sulfur coordination number is greater than two sulfide glasses usually have coordination numbers less than two Experimentally Ga2S3 has not been observed in a glassy state There exists however a GaS4 unit within the Ga-S crystal which has been noted as the glass former The La-S bond is ionic and likely to be a network modifier By adding an ionic sulfide to the crystal like La2S3 it is possible to modify the crystalline Ga2S3 into a vitreous structure Of all the rare-earth sulfides lanthanum gives the largest range of vitreous compositions The effect of adding an ionic sulfide modifier such as a La2S3 molecule to the crystal is to break one of the Ga-S dative bonds and replace it with a S2- anion This anion links the gallium atom such that its tetrahedral environment is not altered but what was a tricoordinated S atom now becomes a dicoordinated bridging atom This process creates a negative void which can then be filled by a La3+ cation Electrically the effect of adding La2S3 is to give the glass an essentially ionic character
Purification and synthesis
For both the practical application and scientific study of chalcogenide glasses glass purity is of utmost importance Varying levels of trace impurities even at levels of a few parts per million can alter the spectroscopic behavior of a glass Similarly impurities are a major concern for optical components Impurities in the raw materials and hence in the resulting glass contribute to the loss of power through an optical component whether it is in the form of a long glass fiber or an infrared window These impurities contribute to the optical loss through absorption and scattering as well as serving as nucleation sites for crystallization
Although high purity raw elements are now commercially available with 99.9999% purity routine for many metals even this level of purity is often not sufficient particularly for optical fiber applications
More of a concern are commercially available chalcogenide compounds such as germanium sulfide gallium sulfide or arsenic sulfide Although these may have been synthesized from high purity elements the conversion process itself can readily introduce oxide water or organic impurities It is not unheard of to find for example commercial gallium sulphide contaminated with 45% or more gallium oxide through incomplete reaction of the precursors during production
The conventional method for producing chalcogenide glasses is through the use of sealed ampoule melting In this technique the required glass precursor materials are sealed under vacuum in a silica ampoule melted and then quenched to form a glass within the ampoule The requirement for the sealed atmosphere is dictated by the volatile nature of many of the precursors which if melted in open atmosphere can result in large compositional changes or complete removal of components with low vapour pressures This process also has the effect of trapping any impurities in the precursors within the glass as thus the precursor purity limits
the ultimate quality of the glass that is produced In addition impurities can be transferred to the glass from the ampoule walls
The closed nature of the process leads to tightly controlled quality In addition to the open and closed systems for glass melting
chalcogenide chemical vapour deposition is emerging as a method to produce high quality chalcogenide glass in both thin film and bulk glass form
Gallium lanthanum sulfide glasses use essentially non-volatile components La2S3 La2O3 and Ga2S3 to form the basic glass with glass modifiers added as needed This allows melting in an open atmosphere under a flowing inert gas typically argon Batches of the compounds are prepared in a nitrogen-purged glovebox placed in a vitreous carbon crucible and transferred to a silica tube furnace in a sealed vessel Melting is typically at 1150?ÅãC for 24 hours The molten gallium sulfides fluxed the lanthanum compounds and incorporated them into the melt at temperatures much lower than their respective melting points The viscosity of the melt is low enough at approximately 1 poise to allow full mixing without the need for a rocking furnace which is required for melting in an ampoule The melt is normally quenched to glass by pushing it into a water cooled jacket An advantage of melting in an open atmosphere is the ability of volatile impurities to boil off and be carried away a significant advantage over sealed systems For example no SH- impurity is observed in the absorption spectra of Ga-La-S glasses compared to very significant quantities in sulphide glasses melted by the sealed ampoule technique


Rapid Results

Rapid Results is a structured process that mobilizes teams to achieve tangible results over a rapid time frame and accelerate organizational learning Schaffer Consulting a management consulting firm headquartered in Stamford Connecticut developed the Rapid Results approach based on their experience working with clients across industries to achieve breakthrough levels of performance Robert Schaffer and Ron Ashkenas wrote Rapid Results How 100-Day Projects Build the Capacity for Large-Scale Change which details how Rapid Results works and its impact There are also numerous articles about the approach in The New York Times Harvard Business Review and Foreign Policy among other publications In 2007 Schaffer Consulting founded the Rapid Results Institute RRI to refine the methodology to support non-profit work and development projects across Sub-Saharan Africa South America the United States and the Middle East
Methodology
The objective of Rapid Results initiatives is to achieve dramatic results formed under the pressure of short timeframes and ambitious targets Rapid Results initiatives begin with a call to action for significant performance improvement delivered by a single leader or group of leaders to cross-functional teams of 8-10 people Team members then set and commit to seemingly unreasonable short-term goals ? often in 100 days or less ? tied to the strategic imperatives outlined by their leaders Teams then experiment with new ways of working capturing learnings along the way and persisting until they achieve desired outcomes Rapid Results aims to stimulate innovation collaboration and more effective execution within and across organizations and stakeholder groups Leaders leverage initial results to create longer-term and wider-scale impact in subsequent waves of Rapid Results projects
Business Impact
Leaders in many industries leverage Rapid Results to achieve performance goals including accelerating growth increasing productivity and realizing cost savings
Lynn Chambers Group Head of Talent at the London Stock Exchange Group says ÅgThis approach can be taken to accelerate progress on almost any goal.Åh Dean Scarborough President and Chief Executive Officer of Avery Dennison describes Rapid Results Ågdriving an incredible amount of creativityÅh among team members Martha Marsh former president and CEO of Stanford Hospital and Clinics observes that Rapid Results Ågprovide an intense focus on getting results while helping build the capacity of our organization to drive transformational change.Åh
Rapid Results Institute
Formed in 2007 the Rapid Results Institute works with a broad range of partners ? including government agencies not-for-profit organizations and international development agencies ? across a wide spectrum of development initiatives Past and ongoing projects include H.I.V prevention in Eritrea and Ethiopia public sector reform in Kenya waste management in Brazil and housing homeless veterans in the United States
The Rapid Results Institute is partnering with the 100,000 Homes Campaign and the US Department of Veterans Affairs to house homeless veterans across the United States
Development Impact
Following a project on HIV/AIDS awareness among youth Eritrean Minister of Education Mr Osman Saleh called the Rapid Results Approach a new movement In Kenya an independent evaluation by the AIDS Research and Treatment journal reported that Ågsigni?cant improvement in PMTCT of mother-to-child-transmission services can be achieved through introduction of an RRI Results Initiative which appears to lead to sustained bene?ts for pregnant HIV-infected women and their infants.Åh
Due to its success in a variety of contexts the Rapid Results Approach has been adopted by the World Bank as well as by many Kenyan government ministries


Que vida mas triste

Que vida mas triste Spanish What a sad life was a Spanish comedy series for Internet created by Natxo del Agua and Ruben Ontiveros scripted and directed by the latter Que vida mas triste achieved more than two million visits to its website at the start of the year 2008 This web also counted on several collaborations such as Alejandro TejeriaÅLs In October 2008 the format was adapted for a television series broadcast by laSexta
Plot
The series deal with Borja an ordinary guy from Basauri spontaneous fun and slightly cynical who works as an operator crane and still lives with his parents that misadventures and amazing situations happen to every week During the first three seasons broadcast on Internet Borja Perez tells the spectators about his daily life pretending he is filming a videoblog
According to one of its creators Ruben Ontiveros the attractiveness of the series resides in the fact that we are used to watch superhero movies people to whom extraordinary things happen winners people that overcome all problems and succeeds but life is not like that Borja represents a bit of all of us Borja is a typical looser with whom we can sometimes identify
During the first few episodes the series wanted to give the impression that what the spectators were seeing was an individualsÅLs real life To support such a fiction at times the camera recorded from unusual angles as though it was hidden to capture a scene or it showed us things that Borja didnÅLt want us to see Later particularly from its television broadcast playing with the idea that it is really a fictional product some episodes take place on the set with the cameras at sight as well as the spotlights and even technical staff There are also episodes in which fantastic events happen such as time travels magic space-time vortices etc but these episodes are exceptional During the first seasons the series had a strong continuity The television format has caused the plot to develop more slowly that some protagonist characters become secondary or just disappear Nuria and Izaskun have fallen out of the limelight and Laura has completely disappeared whereas new ones have appeared BorjaÅLs father Jose Luis Veronica and Sara
Structure
Each episode starts with Borja Perez sitting on his bed looking at the spectators With great emphasis he sets out a situation that has recently happened to him But Borja is not often honest and the spectator discovers he is lying because the narration is interspersed with flashbacks where we see what actually happened
Guest appearances
Through the course of the series several famous actors TV-speakers and other personalities played cameo parts television presenters Patricia Conde and El Gran Wyoming movie directors Nacho Vigalondo and Koldo Serra and actors Oscar Jaenada Gorka Otxoa and Ernesto Sevilla

The Stamp Collector

The Stamp Collector is a
book recommended for ages 8 and up by Jennifer Lanthier and Francois Thisdale It was published in 2012 by Fitzhenry & Whiteside A French language edition Le Collectionneur de Timbres is due to be released in October 2013
Plot
A city boy finds a discarded postage stamp that unlocks his imagination a country boy is captivated by stories When they grow up the two boys take different paths?one becomes a prison guard the other works in a factory?but their early childhood passions remain Their lives intersect years later when the country boy's stories of hope land him in prison guarded by the city boy
The rules prohibit the guard and writer from talking As the years pass the writer's story spreads around the world and letters of support from faraway places begin to arrive The guard is fascinated by the beautiful stamps and intrigued by what they suggest about the prisoner he watches With time the guard feels compelled to deliver first the stamps and eventually the letters as evidence to the writer that the world has not forgotten him
A unique friendship begins The writer grows ever weaker while the guard begs him to tell him his stories and promises to share them After the writer's death the guard courageously leaves his post and journeys to a distant but safe library where he puts pen to paper and begins to share the stories
Although the setting of The Stamp Collector is unnamed the postmarks and Chinese characters used in the illustrations suggest a thinly-disguised China
Freedom of Expression Activism
An afterword in the book explains the concept of freedom of expression and the work done by International PEN and other charities on behalf of writers and journalists imprisoned or at risk It is also disclosed that a portion of all proceeds from its sales Ågwill support PEN Canada in its efforts to bring hope to writers in prisons around the world.Åh PEN Canada is the Canadian arm of International PEN
Lanthier says the story was inspired by the writer Nuremuhamet Yasin who was sentenced to ten years in a Chinese prison in 2004 for writing a short story called ÅgThe Wild Pigeon.Åh Lanthier advocated for his release while volunteering for PEN Canada At a meeting of PEN advocates Lanthier met the exiled journalist Jiang Weiping who had spent six years in a Chinese prison for a series of investigative articles he wrote exposing the corruption of the government official Bo Xilai Lanthier says that encounter led her to write The Stamp Collector In the afterword Lanthier explains ÅgWe asked Mr Weiping if there was any point in writing letters to prisoners who werenÅft allowed to see them He said yes ? because the guards collect stamps.Åh
In June 2013 The Stamp Collector won the Huguenot Society of Canada Award presented by the Ontario Historical Society honouring the book for bringing Ågpublic awareness to the principles of freedom of conscience and freedom of thought.Åh
Illustrations
ThisdaleÅfs illustrations blend traditional drawing and painting with digital imagery ÅgDetailed Chinese landscapes are creatively blended with dreamy imaginative vistasÅh creating a Ågriveting combination of realism and imagination.Åh Layered into each image are Chinese characters bright stamps and ghostly postmarks
One image that of the discarded stamp found by the city boy in the opening pages and saved for its beauty recurs throughout the book and serves as the metaphor carrying the bookÅfs political message Thisdale based the image on this particular stamp on The Temple of the Sun in Chaoyang District Beijing China During the 2008 Summer Olympics at the behest of the IOC The Temple of the Sun was one of three locations designated by Chinese officials as official protest zones All applications to protest there were denied or withdrawn and no protests took place At least two persons who applied to protest were arrested and
sentenced to reeducation


Fluorescence image-guided surgery

Fluorescence image-guided surgery FIGS is a medical imaging technique used to detect fluorescently labelled structures during surgery Similarly to standard image-guided surgery FIGS has the purpose of guiding the surgical procedure and providing the surgeon of real time visualization of the operating field When compared to other medical imaging modalities FIGS is cheaper and superior in terms of resolution and number of molecules detectable As a drawback penetration depth is usually very poor 100 É m in the visible wavelengths but it can reach up to 1?2?cm when excitation wavelengths in the near infrared are used
Imaging devices
FIGS is performed using imaging devices with the purpose of providing real time simultaneous information from color reflectance images bright field and fluorescence emission One or more light sources are used to excite and illuminate the sample Light is collected using optical filters that match the emission spectrum of the fluorophore Imaging lenses and digital cameras CCD or CMOS are used to produce the final image Live video processing can also be performed to enhance contrast during fluorescence detection and improve signal-to-background ratio In recent years a number of commercial companies have emerged to offer devices specializing in fluorescence in the NIR wavelengths with the goal of capitalizing upon the growth in off label use of indocyanine green ICG However commercial systems with multiple fluorescence channels also exist commercially for use with fluorescein and protoporphyrin IX PpIX
Excitation sources
Fluorescence excitation is accomplished using various kind of light sources Halogen lamps have the advantage of delivering high power for a relatively low cost Using different band-pass filters the same source can be used to produce several excitation channels from the UV to the near infrared Light-emitting diodes LEDs have become very popular for low cost broad band illumination and narrow band excitation in FIGS Because of their characteristic light emission spectrum a narrow range of wavelengths that matches the absorption spectrum of a given fluorophore can be selected without using a filter further reducing the complexity of the optical system Both halogen lamps and LEDs are suitable for white light illumination of the sample Excitation can also be performed using laser diodes particularly when high power over a short wavelength range typically 5-10?nm is needed In this case the system has to account for the limits of exposure to laser radiation
Detection techniques
Live images from the fluorescent dye and the surgical field are obtained using a combination of filters lenses and cameras During open surgery hand held devices are usually preferred for their ease of use and mobility A stand or arm can be used to maintain the system on top of the operating field particularly when the weight and complexity of the device is high e.g when multiple cameras are used The main disadvantage of such devices is that operating theater lights can interfere with the fluorescence emission channel with a consequent decrease of signal-to-background ratio This issue is usually solved by dimming or switching off the theater lights during fluorescence detection
FIGS can also be performed using minimally invasive devices such as laparoscopes or endoscopes In this case a system of filters lenses and cameras is attached to the end of the probe Unlike open surgery the background from external light sources is reduced Nevertheless the excitation power density at the sample is limited by the low light transmission of the fiber optics in endoscopes and laparoscopes particularly in the near infrared Moreover the ability of collecting light is much reduced compared to standard imaging lenses used for open surgery devices
FIGS devices can also be implemented for robotic surgery for example in the da Vinci Surgical System
Clinical applications
The major limitation in FIGS is the availability of clinically approved fluorescent dyes which have a novel biological indication Indocyanine Green ICG has been widely used as a non-specific agent to detect sentinel lymph nodes during surgery ICG has the main advantage of absorbing and emitting light in the near infrared allowing detection of nodes under several centimeters of tissue Methylene Blue can also be used for the same purpose with an excitation peak in the red portion of the spectrum First clinical applications using tumor-specific agents that detect deposits of ovarian cancer during surgery have been carried out
History
The first uses of FIGS dates back to the 1940s when fluorescein was first used in humans to enhance the imaging of brain tumors cysts edema and blood flow in vivo In modern times the use has fallen off until a multicenter trial in Germany concluded that FIGS to help guide glioma resection based upon fluorescence from PpIX provided significant short term benefit


Mervyn Wingfield

Captain Mervyn Robert George Wingfield 16 January 1911?15 March 2005 was a Royal Navy officer who served in submarines throughout World War II narrowly surviving a sinking after a collision in the North Sea and was the first British submarine commander to sink a Japanese submarine
Early life
Wingfield was born in Rathgar Ireland youngest son of Colonel the Rev William Wingfield Royal Field Artillery His father had been awarded a DSO at Gallipoli He was educated at Bedford School and Pangbourne College entering Dartmouth Naval College as a cadet at the age of 14
Royal Navy
As a midshipman he trained in battleships Benbow Warspite and Valiant before joining the submarine service in 1934 He spent five years in the submarine HMS Odin cruising all over South East Asia and training his crew in gunnery When war broke out Odin sailed to Colombo and then Malta from which Wingfield returned home in May 1940 through France to take the training course for a submarine command
Wartime
His first command was a World War I submarine the H28 in which he patrolled off the coast of Holland This was followed by the newly built but ill-fated Umpire which sank in the North Sea after a night time collision in July 1941 with an armed British trawler the Peter Hendriks Wingfield picked up semi-conscious from the North Sea forty minutes later was the only survivor of the four men who had been on the bridge Of those men trapped in the hull who escaped one was Edward Young who described the incident in his book ÅeOne of Our SubmarinesÅf Wingfield was then given command of the submarine Sturgeon which made two Arctic patrols In one of these he penetrated Trondheim fjord submerged despite the presence of mines and sunk a merchant ship for which he received a DSO Between these patrols Sturgeon acted as a navigating beacon for the raid on St Nazaire in March 1942
From September 1942 Wingfield commanded the submarine Taurus which after a patrol to Norway was based first in Algiers enforcing a blockade of Marseilles then in Malta operating in the Aegean and finally in Beirut attacking enemy shipping and landing agents on Greek islands While sinking caiques in one Greek harbour the submarine came under attack from horse-mounted Bulgars and returned to sea under a hail of machine-gun fire
Taurus then sailed to Colombo patrolling the Andaman Sea and Malacca Straits and on 13 November 1943 torpedoed and sank the Japanese submarine I-34 This was the first Japanese submarine to be sunk by a Royal Navy submarine In the ensuing counterattack Taurus was damaged by depth charges but surfaced and the well-trained 4-inch gun crew surprised and disabled the Japanese submarine chaser Wingfield was awarded a bar to the DSC he had earned in the Mediterranean See Action of 13 November 1943
Transferring to Trincomalee Taurus was occupied in mine-laying off Penang and attacking Japanese shipping In May 1944 she departed the Indian Ocean and Wingfield took the submarine home via Aden Port Said Malta and Gibraltar to Holy Loch Scotland for a refit after twelve war patrols in two years
After the War
Wingfield was appointed second-in-command of the cruiser Euryalus the flagship of Admiral Earl Mountbatten This was followed by staff appointments in Washington DC and Norfolk Virginia then in NATO Paris Promoted to Captain in 1953 his first role was at HMS Jupiter on the Gare Loch West Scotland before appointment as Naval Attache in Athens and Tel Aviv during the Suez crisis His final command after three years as Director of Underwater Weapons at the Admiralty was the Royal Naval Air Station at Abbotsinch Scotland before retirement in 1963 He died at Hindhead Surrey in 2005 aged 94 survived by his wife Sheila their daughter and their two sons
Wingfield wrote his memoirs in the 1980s and these were published in edited form by Whittles in 2012 as Wingfield at War In his Foreword Admiral Lord Boyce wrote
Captain Mervyn Wingfield was one of the last of his generation of submariners who made their reputation in World War II Before the war he had served on the China station in the war he commanded three submarines Umpire Sturgeon and Taurus survived a collision in the North Sea spent a winter in the Arctic penetrated the Norwegian fjords submerged through a minefield surfaced off St Nazaire in view of German guns to act as a navigation marker for the raiding force fought cavalry in the northern Aegean and later off Penang was the first to sink a Japanese submarine ? and barely survived the subsequent,vicious counterattack after Taurus was severely damaged and became stuck in the mud at the bottom Any one of these incidents would have merited a place for Wingfield in the history of naval warfare and the pantheon of submarine heroes It is remarkable that one man should have been involved in so much action in so few years


Arnold Book of Old Songs

The Arnold Book of Old Songs is a collection of English Scottish Irish Welsh and French folk songs and traditional songs with new piano accompaniments by Roger Quilter Quilter dedicated it to and named it after his nephew Arnold Guy Vivian who perished at the hands of German forces in Italy in 1943
It consists of sixteen songs five songs were written in 1921 and another eleven were written in 1942 Only the latter eleven were written with Vivian in mind at the outset
Songs written in 1921
Five of the songs were written in 1921 with each being dedicated to a friend relative or popular singer of the day These were
Songs written for Arnold Vivian in 1942
Arnold Guy Vivian was Quilter's nephew the son of his sister Norah by her second husband Guy Noel Vivian He was born on 21 May 1915 and named after Quilter's and Norah's brother Arnold Quilter who had been killed at Gallipoli only 15 days earlier on 6 May Roger Quilter had been closer to Arnold than to any of his other siblings and he became deeply attached to his namesake nephew They found they were in tune with each other's overall gentle sensitivity Arnold Vivian had a high light tenor voice and often sang his uncle's songs Quilter dedicated his song Sigh No More Ladies from the 3rd Shakespeare Set Op 30 to his nephew
Arnold Vivian joined the Grenadier Guards 6th Battalion at the start of World War II and in 1942 left England for active service Quilter wrote a deeply personal song called What Will You Do Love for him at that time It was never intended for publication and was recorded for the first time in 2005 At around the same time Quilter started working on eleven new arrangements of old songs to have something to welcome his nephew home from the war
It was not to be In 1943 Arnold Vivian was listed as missing in action He never returned and his family did not learn his fate until after the war had ended He had been taken prisoner-of-war by German forces in Tunis in North Africa Some months later he and his friend Lord Brabourne also from the 6th Battalion were being transported by train from an Italian POW camp to Germany and they escaped near Bronzolo in the South Tyrol They were recaptured on 15?September 1943 and summarily executed the same day They were shot in the back of the neck while being made to kneel on railway tracks Their bodies were left on the side of the tracks by the Germans as a warning to others but the local people gave them a burial They were later reinterred in the war cemetery in Padua The atrocity was later investigated as a war crime and a former German officer was found guilty and executed
The news of these events devastated Quilter and could only have added to the mental decline he was already exhibiting As an epitaph to his nephew Quilter added the five earlier songs from 1921 to the eleven new ones and dedicated the entire set to his memory even naming it after him the Arnold Book of Old Songs Each of the 16 songs bears an individual dedication To the memory of Arnold Guy Vivian
The songs were initially published separately by October 1947 and as a set in 1950 Roger Quilter died in 1953
Words
Most of the songs have their well known words but the three French songs The Man Behind the Plough My Lady's Garden and Pretty Month of May and the sole Welsh song The Ash Grove employ new sets of words provided by Rodney Bennett 1890-1948 a children's book author and poet who had often worked with Quilter on his songs and works for the theatre Rodney Bennett was the father of Sir Richard Rodney Bennett Bennett's words to The Ash Grove were written in direct response to news of Arnold Vivian's death
Also the words to My Lady Greensleeves are attributed to an Irish poet named John Irvine and differ from the traditional ones Quilter and Irvine had worked on a duet version of the song but the solo voice version was the one published in The Arnold Book of Old Songs
The songs
The songs are varied in rhythm tempo mood atmosphere and national origin Quilter often captures a quality that has been described as golden nostalgia
Grainger's assessment
Roger Quilter's friend Percy Grainger was very favourably impressed with the Arnold Book of Old Songs He wrote


Peter J Pitchess Detention Center

Peter J Pitchess Detention Center also known as Pitchess Detention Center or simply Pitchess is an all-male county detention center and correctional facility named in honor of Peter J Pitchess located directly east of exit 173 off of Interstate 5 in the city of Castaic in the County of Los Angeles in southern California
The 2,620 acre site was previously known as the Wayside Honor Rancho or the Wayside Jail by which it is still sometimes known and was nicknamed the Wayside Drunk Farm in the 1940s because of the large proportion of inmates serving time for alcohol-related offenses? when first built for prison use in 1938 it was a minimum-security facility where inmates worked on a farm setting In 1983 it was renamed the Peter J Pitchess Honor Rancho All farming operations were terminated in 1992 and the rancho component of the center was closed altogether in 1995 because of budgetary constraints at which point it acquired its current name It is run by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and is divided into a North Facility East Facility South Facility and North County Correctional Facility each managed under different levels of prison security In its current designation it was designed to house approximately 8,600 men either awaiting hearings or trial on a variety of crimes i.e detention or parole violators with sentences of up to one year corrections the two groups collectively termed inmates As of 1998 it was the county's largest jail complex It is also the oldest operating jail in the county The Municipal and Superior courthouses where Pitchess inmates are taken for hearings and trials include Van Nuys San Fernando Burbank Pasadena Newhall Antelope Valley Malibu and downtown Los Angeles
North Facility
Built in 1987 the North Facility was originally built as a medium-security structure though now it is classified as maximum security It is made up of four modules each containing four dormitories each with a sleeping area dining area/ day room and restroom eight disciplinary cells a multipurpose room a medical center a visiting center and three security stations It was designed to house 90 men per dormitory block for a total of 1,450 inmates For the first four years of its existence it operated under the command of the South Facility before gaining its own unit commander and operations staff
The North Facility unofficially closed in 2010 and currently houses less than a third of its capacity of inmates Its only function at the moment is to handle overflow from the other three facilities
East Facility
Built in 1951 the East Facility which once included a bakery and print shop where inmates received vocational training started as a simple disciplinary housing unit for minimum-security inmates working on the farm In 1957 it became the facility's first maximum-security jail It was designed to house 110 men per dormitory block and had a maximum capacity of 1,830 inmates It currently is designed to house approximately 850 inmates including 400 parole violators awaiting Morrissey hearings It consists of two hard lock modules and an inmate processing area As of January 2015 The Pitchess Detention Center East is closed
South Facility
Built in 1971 the South Facility is a medium-security jail that offers inmates vocational programs such as masonry dog grooming and carpentry Some inmates work on crews at the county Fire Department's Fire Suppression Training Camp No 12 which a sign on the prison grounds at one point affectionately called Disneyland It was designed to house 85 men per domitory block and had a maximum capacity of 1,700 inmates
The South Facility was curtailed between November 2001 and October 2007 during which it was called the North Annex
Fire Camp
The South Facility's Fire Camp Training Facility currently allows those inmates convicted of non-serious nonviolent and nonsexual offenses mostly victimless drug-related crimes as well as theft and fraud to participate for several months in physically-demanding firefighter training and to do so under the supervision of local law enforcement The program is the result of California Assembly Bill 109 the state's realignment plan Inmates participating in this program are distinguished by their orange jumpers At the completion of the 80-hour program the facility hosts a formal graduation ceremony
North County Correctional Facility
Known as SuperMax and distinct from the North Facility mentioned previously the North County Correctional Facility NCCF built in 1990 is considered a state-of-the-art maximum-security jail offering vocational training in printing bakery production and clothes manufacturing It also includes a 16-bed hospital dormitory The rest of the facility was designed to house 58 men per dormitory block and to have a capacity of 3,700 inmates
Women's Village Project
On October 26 of 2012 the County of Los Angeles gave written notice of its intent to create a women's inmate facility within the Pitchess Detention Center The 21-acre facility will require the demolition of most of the existing structures in the planned project area located adjacent to the South Facility When completed it will consist of a series of single-story cottages each containing a pod of beds and when combined with beds in four existing structures which will not be demolished will be able to house 1,156 female inmates
The Century Regional Detention Center in Lynnwood is currently serving as an all female facility It has a 2,100 inmate capacity


Drone journalism

Drone journalism is the use of drones or unmanned aircraft systems UAS for journalistic purposes According to the FAA an unmanned aircraft is a device that is used or is intended to be used for flight in the air with no onboard pilot
The use of drones for information collection in the journalism industry is still new Two university journalism programs are testing drones in this context namely the Drone Journalism Lab founded in late November 2011 by Matt Waite professor of journalism and mass communication at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the Drone Journalism Program at the University of Missouri On June 2014 the London Evening Standard published a story by Nimrod Kamer on latest drone journalism attempts
US legal framework
The Federal Aviation Administration which regulates airspace over the US has yet to establish rules for integrating UAS into the National Airspace System NAS though Congress has called for the FAA to establish such regulations by 2015 Currently legislation on commercial unmanned aviation including for use in commercial media is at a standstill The FAA allows government entities use of UAS on a case-by-case basis via a Certificate of Authorization COA however this option is unavailable to the general public The FAA does allow hobbyists to operate model aircraft including remotely or autonomously controlled craft under Advisory Circular 91-57 which stipulates that these aircraft never fly above 400?feet or within 2?miles of an airport
With regard to general UAS the FAA stipulates in official policy The current FAA policy for UAS operations is that no person may operate a UAS in the National Airspace System without specific authority For UAS operating as public aircraft the authority is the COA for UAS operating as civil aircraft the authority is special airworthiness certificates and for model aircraft the authority is AC 91-57 AC 91-57 only applies to recreational model aircraft operators and thus specifically excludes its use by persons or companies for business purposes
In February 2013 the FAA developed a domestic drone test site program that will establish six test sites for the use of drones under an expanded privacy regulatory system Those using drones within the test sites will have to develop a privacy policy on how they will collect and use information and will agree to follow local state and federal privacy laws or face additional penalties from the FAA
Twenty-nine states have begun the process of establishing regulations on UAS The majority of these regulations restrict law enforcement from using unmanned systems without a search warrant Several states are seeking to ban photography of private properties or to forbid drone technology altogether In New Hampshire for example aerial photography of private property including photos obtained via satellite has been banned It is not yet clear if or to what extent state regulation of UAS will carry weight at the federal level considering the Supreme Court's recognition of the FAA's regulatory authority over the NAS
Key players
Because drone journalism is such a new topic of debate the key players outside of legislative and decision-making bodies such as the FAA in this debate play particularly large roles in the media public sphere
Matt Waite founded the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Drone Journalism Lab to explore how drones can be used for reporting More specifically the lab's purpose is to provide a place for the study of the ethicality legality and practicality of drone use in journalism The lab's website plays a key role in the drone journalism debate as it provides an online discussion platform as well as links to and analysis of research and news articles
Matthew Schroyer is a drone and data journalist based in Urbana Illinois and blogger on drone journalism at MentalMuniton.com and founder of the Professional Society of Drone Journalists PSDJ located at DroneJournalism.org He currently develops drone technology and small unmanned aerial vehicles sUAV for use in journalistic ventures As part of his work on EnLiST a National Science Foundation grant at the University of Illinois Schroyer heads the Drones for Schools program through which high school students learn engineering design and STEM concepts for the building and operating of their own unmanned aerial vehicles for photomapping
Scott Pham is the founder and director of the Missouri Drone Journalism Program a partnership between the Missouri School of Journalism the University of Missouri Information Technology Program and NPR member station KBIA Pham is also the Content Director for KBIA.org
Ethics considerations
A significant concern with the use of UAS for journalistic reporting is the potential for invading people's privacy such as unobstructed views of individuals and private property A crucial question is whether individuals have the right to expect privacy when their picture is being taken from hundreds of miles above the ground Furthermore the ethics considerations surrounding satellite images come into play What are the ethical boundaries of news-gathering from satellites in space
On April 3 2013 the FAA held an engagement session on drone privacy in which the public could engage in discussion on such questions of privacy Opinions expressed during the session can generally be summarized in five overarching concerns
With discussion of drone use for journalistic reasons increasing in the public sphere non-commercial journalists will be responsible for establishing professional standards as it is possible that the FAA will not release new regulations until 2015 Waite and Schroyer both hold that existing journalistic ethics codes can apply to drones as the principles behind these ethics codes are broad In an article in the Society of Professional Journalists Quill Magazine Waite is paraphrased as saying that he approaches ethical questions of drone journalism by first checking to see whether a question has been dealt with before as many of questions in drone journalism debates have already been raised with regard to journalistic use of telephoto lenses and helicopters The article quotes Waite We keep asking ourselves Is this a new ethical problem or an old ethical problem with new technology
In an effort to professionalize the journalistic practice of using drones Schroyer and the members of DroneJournalism.org are seeking to create a drone journalism code of ethics including appeals for use of drones only when there is no safer method of procuring the information needed This code does hold however that violation of state laws and FAA regulations may be necessary in order to access critical information

Rural Poverty
Today more than 70 percent of the world's poorest people or roughly 1.4 billion people live in rural isolated areas limiting their access to basic resources Most rural communities depend on the land for their livelihood and survival Rural communities often have very little access to financial services such as savings and credit and struggle week to week to make ends meet This makes them extremely vulnerable to external shocks such as natural disasters family emergencies poor crop yields and civil unrest Without an established safety net external shocks can cause rural families to fall deeper into a cycle of poverty
When left with few options to generate needed income rural farmers often cut trees to create more farmland and others cut trees to sell as fuel wood or charcoal This speeds the process of deforestation which further exacerbates the problems of rural poverty creating a vicious cycle
Methodology
The strategy Plant With Purpose employs for transformational community development is based on a three-part approach of environmental restoration economic empowerment and spiritual renewal The overarching aim is to provide training and tools that equip rural communities to develop their own talents and resources to work themselves out of poverty
Environmental Restoration
Areas suffering from rural poverty often also suffer from environmental degradation Protecting the land and soil through planting trees and sustainable farming techniques is one way to restore the environment and provide a source of income for the community
Economic Empowerment
Village Savings and Loan Associations VSLA provide a sustainable form of microfinance that allows participants to build capital This savings-led approach equips self-elected groups to create a financial safety net by saving their own money and then making small loans to individuals within the group
Spiritual Renewal
Plant With Purpose partners with local churches to develop local leadership and support discipleship efforts Plant With Purpose also uses a formal program designed to mobilize congregations to be agents of change in their communities by finding solutions to existing needs using local resources
International Impact

Haiti is recognized as the poorest country in the western hemisphere and has one of the world's highest rates of deforestation The country is still recovering following a magnitude-7.0 earthquake in 2010 Plant With Purpose has been working in rural Haitian communities since 1997 In rural areas 88 percent of Haitians are considered poor living on less than $2 a day and 67 percent are extremely poor living on less than $1.25 a day
Mexico
Plant With Purpose has worked in Oaxaca Mexico with indigenous communities since 1996 and began working in the neighboring state of Chiapas in 2012 Oaxaca and Chiapas are two of the three poorest states in Mexico In Mexico 61 percent of rural families live below the poverty line
Tanzania
Plant With Purpose began working with communities in the Mt Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania in 2004 The majority of Tanzanian farmers who partner with Plant With Purpose are women In Tanzania 98 percent of rural women who are economically active depend on the land for survival through agriculture
Thailand
In 2008 Plant With Purpose began a partnership with an existing organization called the Upland Holistic Development Project UHDP The focus of the program is helping marginalized hill tribe communities in ThailandÅfs northern hills The northern hill tribe communities of Thailand consist of hundreds of thousands of refugees The majority of ethnic hill tribe people came to Thailand to escape civil strife in Myanmar Burma
Highlights
In 2010 Plant With Purpose's Executive Director Scott Sabin published Tending to Eden Environmental Stewardship for God's People Tending to Eden offers a global perspective on the theological foundation for caring for the earth and its people

As the story begins in the Land of Aelmor a reality parallel to that of the reader a mage named Lela True is on a journey home when she is slain by an unknown adversary At about the same time in the reader's universe a girl named Kaori Miki receives a bracelet which is connected to a bracelet worn by Lela mysteriously causing Kaori to awake in Lela's body As the story unfolds Kaori faces challenges in both worlds her actions affecting those close to her in either universe
In 2007 the Ontario Arts Council awarded Mayhew the Northern Arts grant to aid in the production of the Secrets of Sorcerers Vol 2 graphic novel
The First Emperor 2006
Mayhew worked as the illustrator for The First Emperor which follows the story of Prince Fu Su son of Emperor Zheng who sends him on a quest to discover the secret of eternal life while providing educational historical information to the reader about Emperor Zheng and his legacy as well as the unification of China
Love Pet 2006
Published as a short web manga Love Pet follows the story of a devoted house cat named Elmo whose wish to please his lonely owner Bo results in his transformation into a human companion Elroy who must face the challenges associated with learning to be human and interacting with Bo
Legend of the Ztarr 2011
This series follows a protagonist a young woman by the name of Adora Ztarr the daughter of a legendary rebel who was killed attempting to overthrow an oppressive emperor Lord J'Nar Recruited to succeed her father's legacy Adora is faced with challenges resulting from ideologies and preconceptions on both sides Adora must use critical thinking skills to confront a group of antagonists who are only interested in things that can confirm beliefs they already have and who thereby exhibit a confirmation bias
According to Mayhew the goal to create a series that serves as a skeptical epic with sci-fantasy feel?swords emperors prophecies star ships and powerful mysterious objects?that can connect readers to the values of critical thinking using emotional rather than logical arguments
Other media
In 2009 Mayhew was featured in the TEDFellows 2009 Nokia Responsiveness campaign which profiled Mayhew as well as other TED Fellows and their work In the video Mayhew describes some of the influences driving her work saying my interest in science and critical thinking filters through me into my characters Åc In Manga thereÅfs typically a lot of magic and the fights defy the laws of physics But the more IÅfve read about science and astronomy thereÅfs this magical feeling to science Often when you reveal how the universe really is itÅfs far more beautiful than you can imagine
Skepticism
One of Mayhew's stated goals as a writer is to ensure that her work as a writer and artist crosses over with promoting science-based thinking
On a 23 March 2010 airing of ABC News Nightline Faceoff Does God Have a Future which placed Deepak Chopra and Jean Houston against Michael Shermer and Sam Harris Mayhew participated in the conversation challenging Chopra on his claims that there are deeper ways of knowing than the scientific method asking Chopra if we don't use the objective scientific method how do we distinguish what is true from what we simply want to be true Chopra answered that he is hoping that the truth will be found when we actually develop a science of consciousness that goes beyond the subject-object split
On 8 April 2011 Mayhew was interviewed on an episode of The Reality Check where she discussed the relationship between manga and anime as well as her lifelong interest in science Mayhew's interest in science at a young age included elements of the paranormal After discussing the film What the Bleep Do We Know with a friend well-versed in physics she began to further question extraordinary or pseudoscientific claims leading to her interest in scientific skepticism
On 10 April 2010 she was interviewed on an episode of the Skepticality podcast Skepticism and Manga During the interview Mayhew discussed topics such as her then-upcoming work on Legend of the Ztarr her TEDActive talk promoting skepticism through storytelling as well as the naming of her blog There Are Four Lights The blog's title Mayhew says is from the episode The two episodes are basically a message about torture but I chose it because there's this line that Jean-Luc Picard says towards the end Åc He explains that he wanted to be let go so bad that he actually thought he could see five lights But even so he doesn't give in and yells There are four lights So I thought that was an appropriate title for a blog that involved skepticism
Mayhew was a guest speaker at The Amaz!ng Meeting 9 13?17 July 2011 where she presented a talk Secular Storytelling which explored science-based and skeptical themes present in Legend of the Ztarr The Token Skeptic podcast interviewed Mayhew on an 8 August 2011 episode On Manga And Amaz!ng-ness about her participation in TAM 9 which had been Mayhew's first skeptical conference attendance
Mayhew participated in an opening Skeptrack panel at Dragon*Con 2011 with Brian Brushwood Margaret Downey D.J Grothe and Desiree Schell She also took part in a panel discussion When Art Meets Science & Skepticism with George Hrab moderator Scott Sigler Tom Merritt and Michael Stackpole
On 17 September 2011 Mayhew participated as a guest rogue on The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe Topics included discussion of Chinese researchers looking at the possibility of capturing asteroids in Earth's orbit for mining of precious metals and discussion of the results of a study which purported to explain a mechanism for acupuncture
At The Amaz!ng Meeting 2012 Mayhew's lecture A Life of Art and Skepticism focused on developing relationships between skepticism and art as well as how skepticism can be used to inform art and storytelling
As a guest speaker at CSIcon 2012 in Nashville TN Mayhew presented a talk entitled Science Fandom Creating Skeptical Heroes


Leeds New Lane railway station

Leeds New Lane is a proposed new railway station to accommodate High Speed Two rail services in West Yorkshire England It will be on a viaduct on New Lane south of Leeds city centre the River Aire and Leeds City station to which it will be connected by an elevated walkway The site is occupied by Central Park a small low-rise office park built in the 1990s and other small office buildings
Background
In 2009 the Labour Government created High Speed Two Ltd to examine the prospect of further high-speed rail in the United Kingdom Later in 2010 the Coalition Government confirmed there would be a terminus in both Leeds and Manchester In January 2013 the final route was announced with a new station being proposed for Leeds and a new station adjacent to Piccadilly station for the terminus in Manchester Both Leeds and Manchester were to have junctions to the south of the cities allowing for connections to the East Coast Main Line and the West Coast Main Line respectively
Proposal
Publication of the proposed route on 28 January 2013 showed that the Leeds station would be a new terminus connected to Leeds City station by airport-style pedestrian walkways possibly with moving walkways
The configuration and design of the station has not been confirmed New Lane is quarter of a mile south of Leeds station and is a cul-de-sac in the centre of a gyratory containing a small business park There is no railway infrastructure at the site Previously there were railways to the west with a goods yard at Crown Point see Leeds Hunslet Lane railway station and mineral lines to transport coal to Meadow Lane Gas Works
The site is next to Bridgewater Place and close to Holbeck Urban Village and the M621 motorway
Proposed facilities
Few details of the proposed facilities have been released however the Department for Transport have confirmed car parking will be provided to the south of the site The station will link to Leeds station which has ticket offices car parks a bus interchange and two concourses containing retail restaurant and licensed facilities There are currently proposals to expand these facilities With the link this will enable facilities to be shared by the two stations The plans released appear to show the New Lane site with a sizeable concourse
Public transport
First Leeds bus routes run around the gyratory and there are stops on Victoria Road and Meadow Lane Both the formerly proposed Leeds Supertram and the currently proposed Leeds Trolleybus routes pass within half a mile of the site
Location in Leeds and on HS2
The plans show the tracks approaching the station from the south-east parallel to the Pontefract Line and then the M621 coming through Meadow Lane Gas Works and Leeds City Business Park with the station on a viaduct which spreads from the centre of the gyratory through the Leeds City Business Park site the viaduct would extend 290m beyond the station buildings This would mean the relocation of several businesses a Leeds City Council depot and a natural gas storage facility consisting of two low-pressure gas holders

Office for administration and payment of individual entitlements

The Office for administration and payment of individual entitlements also known as the Paymaster's Office or PMO is a central office of the European Commission
The PMO's mission is to manage the financial rights of permanent temporary and contractual staff working at the Commission to calculate and to pay their salaries and other financial entitlements The PMO provides these services to other EU institutions and agencies as well The PMO is also responsible for managing the health insurance fund of the Institutions together with processing and paying the claims of reimbursement from staff members The PMO also manages the pension fund and pays the pensions of retired staff members
The PMO's head office horizontal services and four operational units are located in Brussels while two other units are located in Luxembourg and in Ispra where they provide services to local EU staff
PMO activities
Remuneration
The PMO determines and records the financial rights of new staff members of their first day at the Commission and then calculates and pays their remuneration The remuneration includes
Basic monthly Commission salaries range from around ?2,300 per month for a newly recruited AST 1 official to around ?16,000 per month for a top level AD 16 official with over 4 years of seniority Each grade is broken up into five seniority steps with corresponding salary increases Basic salaries are adjusted annually in line with inflation and purchasing power in the EU countries
Officials are also entitled to the reimbursement of certain expenses for example travel expenses for taking up their duties or removal expenses when moving their families to their place of employment
Health insurance
PMO manages the Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme JSIS of the European Communities Officials and other agents are entitled to benefit from the JSIS as well as their family members under certain conditions The JSIS covers medical expenses at a rate of 80% for medical treatments and is funded by a contribution of ~2% deducted from the salaries of officials and agents
Pensions
An official is entitled to an EU pension after at least 10 years of service or if he reaches the age of 63 EU officials normally reach retirement age at 63 but it is also possible to take early retirement with a reduced pension from the age of 55 or to work up until the age of 67 but with no corresponding increase in pension rights
Officials accumulate 1.9% pension rights every year and are entitled to a maximum pension of 70% of their final basic salary Upon leaving active service the PMO calculates the pension rights of officials and other agents including the rights transferred in from national pension schemes In the case of the decease of officials the pension rights are paid to the surviving spouse and/or child(ren
Officials and other agents contribute to up to 1/3 of the costs of the pension scheme Their contribution is 9.25% of their monthly basic salary and is deducted monthly
Unemployment benefits
Temporary and contractual agents may receive a temporary unemployment allowance when their contract with the Commission expires This allowance is calculated and paid by the PMO in accordance with Title 2 of Conditions of employment of other servants of the European Communities
Missions and experts expenses
The expenses incurred by the officials and agents on their official missions as well as certain experts engaged by the Commission are reimbursed The PMO receives and processes all these claims and then pays the expenses according to the rules governing entitlement
For the experts expenses the following persons are entitled
The entitlement covers a daily allowance travel and accommodation expenses


Quantum vacuum plasma thruster

The quantum vacuum plasma thruster or Q-thruster is a theoretical deep-space thruster that uses the quantum vacuum fluctuations to propel a spacecraft Proponents contend that interaction with quantum vacuum plasma is the cause for thrust produced by an experimental engine abbreviated to Q-thruster proposed for use in deep-space propulsion Theoretical physicists Sean M Carroll and John Baez see below have dismissed this because the quantum vacuum as it is currently understood is not a plasma and does not possess any plasma-like characteristics A research team called Eagleworks Laboratories led by Harold G White at the NASA Johnson Space Center claims that novel physics may be responsible for the thrust observed from prototypes No such physics has ever been claimed to have been observed by any other collaboration of physicists or engineers If it is correct that quantum vacuum fluctuations can support thrust sufficient to propel a spacecraft a spacecraft fitted with such a thruster would not need to carry any propellant for its operation
Using a torsion pendulum White's team claims to have measured approximately 30?50 É N of thrust from a microwave cavity resonator designed by Guido Fetta in an attempt at propellant-less propulsion Using the same measurement equipment a non-zero force was also measured on a null resonator that was not designed to experience any such force which Brady and colleagues suggest hints at interaction with the quantum vacuum virtual plasma If correct this would essentially be a proof-of-concept for quantum vacuum plasma thrusters as well as a falsification of the conservation of momentum and energy scientific laws currently favored on the basis of centuries of experimental evidence All measurements were performed at atmospheric pressure presumably in contact with air and with no analysis of systematic errors except for the use of an RF load without the resonant cavity interior as a control device The claims of Brady and colleagues have never been published in a peer reviewed journal only as a conference paper A team of Chinese scientists have also claimed to have measured anomalous thrust arising from a similar device but have calculated anomalous thrust values on the order of 1000 times higher than those claimed by Brady and colleagues at power levels on the order of 100 times greater than that employed by Brady and colleagues
In 2013 the Eagleworks team also tested a device called the SFE Thruster or Serrano Field Effect Thruster built by Gravitec Inc at the request of Boeing and DARPA The Eagleworks team has theorized that this device is a Q-thruster A patent for this device was awarded on December 10 2002 to the inventor Mr Hector Serrano The patent states the device produces thrust through a preselected shaping of an electric field The device consists of a set of circular dielectrics sandwiched between electrodes Gravitec Inc alleges that in 2011 they tested the asymmetrical capacitor device in a high vacuum several times and have ruled out ion wind or electrostatic forces as an explanation for the thrust produced In February through June 2013 the Eagleworks team evaluated the SFE test article in and out of a Faraday Shield and at various vacuum conditions Thrust was observed in the ~1-20 N/kW range The magnitude of the thrust scaled approximately with the cube of the input voltage 20?110?É N To date Eagleworks has not published a peer reviewed paper detailing the results of this experiment
Theory of operation
The research team claims the Q-thruster utilizes the quantum vacuum fluctuations of empty space as a propellant The existence of quantum vacuum fluctuations is not disputed because experiments with the quantum mechanical Casimir effect have unambiguously demonstrated that quantum vacuum fluctuations do exist What remains to be proven is that these fluctuations can be utilized for this practical purpose
A number of notable physicists have found the Q-thruster concept to be implausible For example mathematical physicist John Baez has criticized the reference to quantum vacuum virtual plasma noting that There's no such thing as virtual plasma Noted Caltech theoretical physicist Sean M Carroll has also affirmed this statement writing here is no such thing as a Åequantum vacuum virtual plasma,Åf In addition Lafleur found that quantum field theory predicts no net force implying that the measured thrusts are unlikely to be due to quantum effects However Lafleur noted that this conclusion was based on the assumption that the electric and magnetic fields were homogeneous whereas certain theories posit a small net force in inhomogeneous vacuums
A number of physicists have suggested that a spacecraft or object may generate thrust through its interaction with the quantum vacuum For example Fabrizio Pinto in a 2006 paper published in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society noted it may be possible to bring a cluster of polarisable vacuum particles to a hover in the laboratory and then to transfer thrust to a macroscopic accelerating vehicle Similarly Jordan Maclay in a 2004 paper titled A Gedanken Spacecraft that Operates Using the Quantum Vacuum Dynamic Casimir Effect published in the scientific journal Foundations of Physics noted that it is possible to accelerate a spacecraft based on the dynamic Casimir effect in which electromagnetic radiation is emitted when an uncharged mirror is properly accelerated in vacuum Similarly Puthoff noted in a 2010 paper titled Engineering the Zero-Point Field and Polarizable Vacuum For Interstellar Flight published in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society noted that it may be possible that the quantum vacuum might be manipulated so as to provide energy/thrust for future space vehicles Likewise researcher Yoshinari Minami in a 2008 paper titled Preliminary Theoretical Considerations for Getting Thrust via Squeezed Vacuum published in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society noted the theoretical possibility of extracting thrust from the excited vacuum induced by controlling squeezed light In addition Alexander Feigel in a 2009 paper noted that propulsion in quantum vacuum may be achieved by rotating or aggregating magneto-electric nano-particles in strong perpendicular electrical and magnetic fields Likewise Luigi Maxmilian Caligiuri in a 2014 paper published in the journal Astrophysics and Space Science noted the possibility of a space propulsion system using the interaction between the zero-point field of the quantum vacuum and the high-potential electric field generated in an asymmetrical capacitor showing the resulting force would be driven by quantum vacuum energy density
The Q-thruster operates on the principles of magnetohydrodynamics MHD the same principles and equations of motion used by a conventional plasma thruster The difference is that the Q-thruster uses the subatomic particles spontaneously produced by quantum vacuum fluctuations as its propellant The subatomic particles are charged and are therefore effectively a plasma This plasma is exposed to a crossed electric and magnetic field inducing a force on the particles of the plasma in the EÅ~B direction which is orthogonal to the applied fields
However according to Puthoff although this method can produce angular momentum causing a static disk known as a Feynman disk to begin to rotate it cannot induce linear momentum due to a phenomenon known as hidden momentum that cancels the ability of the proposed EÅ~B propulsion method to generate linear momentum However some recent experimental and theoretical work by Tiggelen and colleagues suggests that linear momentum may be transferred from the quantum vacuum in the presence of an external magnetic field
The Q-thruster would not technically be a reactionless drive because it expels the plasma and thus produces force on the spacecraft in the opposite direction like a conventional rocket engine However a spacecraft using a Q-thruster need not carry any propellant This theory suggests much higher specific impulses are available for Q-thrusters because they only consume electrical power and thus are limited only by their power supply's energy storage densities Preliminary analyses suggest thrust levels of between 1000?4000 É N specific force performance of 0.1 N/kW and an equivalent specific impulse of ~1x1012 s
Experimental goals
Eagleworks is attempting to gather performance data to support development of a Q-thruster engineering prototype for reaction-control-system applications in the force range of 0.1?1 N with a corresponding input electrical power range of 0.3?3?kW The group plans to begin by testing a refurbished test article to improve the historical performance of a 2006 experiment that attempted to demonstrate the Woodward effect The photograph shows the test article and the plot diagram shows the thrust trace from a 500g load cell in experiments performed in 2006
The group hopes that testing the device on a high-fidelity torsion pendulum 1?4?É N at 10?40 W will unambiguously demonstrate the feasibility of this concept The team is maintaining a dialogue with the ISS national labs office for an on-orbit detailed test objective DTO to test the Q-thruster's operation in the vacuum and weightlessness of outer space

Auguste Doriot

Auguste Frederic Doriot 24 October 1863 ? 1955 was a French motoring pioneer who developed built and raced cars for Peugeot before founding his own manufacturing company D.F.P in combination with Ludovic Flandrin and the Parant brothers In 1891 Doriot and his Peugeot colleague Louis Rigoulot completed the longest trip by a petrol powered vehicle when their self-designed and built Daimler powered Peugeot Type 3 completed 2,100 kilometres 1375 miles from Valentigney to Paris and Brest and back again They were attached to the first Paris-Brest-Paris bicycle race but the duo reached Brest one day after the winning cyclist Charles Terront finished in Paris and they then finished six days after him
Doriot's son Georges Doriot emigrated to the United States and became a professor at the Harvard Business School where he later became known as the father of Venture Capitalism He also became a Brigadier general United States during World War II
Early life
Auguste Frederic Doriot was born on 24 October 1863 the second youngest of eight children of Jacques Doriot in the village of Sainte-Suzanne Doubs in Franche-Comte On 27 September 1894 at Valentigney he married 24 year old Berthe Camille Baehler from Voujeaucourt known as Camille who had a Swiss father from Uetendorf and a French mother She had been orphaned aged three and was raised by her grandmother and three older sisters The couple went on to have two children Georges Frederic was born in September 1899 and Madeleine Georgette Zette was born on 11 August 1906 at the family home in Neuilly-sur-Seine
Doriot was a cold stern driving ambitious father unlike Camille Even Georges successes were met without enthusiasm and his cool stare was worse than any physical punishment Georges was trained in the D.F.P workshops and was able to enlist as an Artillery engineer after WW1 After the war the family sent him to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT in the USA but he switched to the Harvard Business School where he became a Professor and the father of Venture Capitalism He also became Brigadier general United States during WWII Georges also noted I think that my father worked 24 hours a day

In 1889 at the age of 26 Doriot finished his military service and took a job at the Peugeot bicycle factory in Beaulieu-sur-Doubs Valentigney or possibly 1887 Armand Peugeot seeing his technical potential and ambition sent him on a series of apprenticeships to develop his skills By 1891 he had become a full employee at the factory and began working for the company's main engineer Louis Rigoulot installing Daimler engines into Peugeot's first vehicles thus developing a four-wheeled petroleum-powered Quadricycle - the Peugeot Type 2 and the Type 3 with 2.5?hp four forward gears plus reverse This enterprise saw Doriot promoted to foreman
World's longest drive Paris?Brest?Paris
In order to publicly prove the reliability and performance of the Quadricycle it was officially entered appended into the 1891 Paris?Brest?Paris bicycle race Armand Peugeot having persuaded the organiser Pierre Giffard of Le Petit Journal of the benefits if his network of monitors and marshalls could vouchsafe the performance The intended distance of 1200 kilometres had never been achieved by a motorised vehicle it being about three times further than the record set by Leon Serpollet from Paris to Lyon Additionally Rigoulot and Doriot loaded the Type 3 Quadricycle with tools spare parts luggage and water and drove it 300 kilometres from Valentigny to Paris a three-day journey They reached 20 kilometres an hour on flat roads but Rigoulot had to walk behind up the hills ready to push Peugeot had to pre-seed the route with petrol supplies so employees placed cans at strategic railway stations about 60 kilometres apart Unfortunately some were lost or disposed of by station masters on safety grounds so the racers had to acquire dry cleaning fluid
The Peugeot left Paris behind the cyclists on 8 September covering 200 kilometres on the first day and 160 kilometres on the second but then lost 24 hours when a gear failed near Morlaix After effecting a repair using local resources a shoemaker's tools they arrived at Brest after dark where they were received by a large crowd and the local Peugeot bicycle dealer Le Petit Journal reported their arrival in Brest on 12 September one day after it reported winning cyclist Charles Terront's finishing the race back in Paris Doriot and Rigoulot arrived in Paris with cyclists 88-96 on 16 September to complete the Paris?Brest?Paris race six days after the winner
Throughout the 1890s Doriot worked for Peugeot at Doubs and was regarded as Armand Peugeot's protege developing and testing the cars plus competing in the Grandes Epreuves Armand Peugeot appointed Doriot as director of Peugeot's Paris factory and new showroom on the Avenue de la Grande Armee
Racing
Doriot drove for Peugeot in the Grandes Epreuves of the 1890s consistently finishing near the top after many hours of competing on unsurfaced roads in difficult conditions On July 22 1894 he finished third in the Paris-Rouen Trail covering the 126 kilometres in seven hours In 1895 he finished fourth in the Paris-Bordeaux-Paris Trail carrying three passengers for the 59 hour race In 1896 he finished eighth in the ten-day Paris-Marseilles-Paris Trail covering the 1,710 kilometres in 81 hours In 1897 he finished 29th in the Paris-Dieppe Trail taking six hours for the 170 kilometres He finished seventh in the 1898 Paris?Amsterdam?Paris after taking 36 hours to cover the 1,431 kilometres In 1899 he was second in the Paris-Saint Malo trail and 10th in the Paris-Ostende trail driving Peugeot voiturettes In 1900 he finished fourth in the Coupe des Voiturettes averaging circa 36 kilometres per hour
D.F.P
Doriot left Peugeot in 1902 and worked for Clement-Bayard for a short time while preparing to establish his own company
In 1906 Doriot cofounded Doriot Flandrin DF et Cie with Ludovic Flandrin also from Clement-Bayard at 169 Boulevard St Denis in Courbevoie Paris where they manufactured a small car with single cylinder 1.1 litre engine It was sold as a Doriot Flandrin In 1908 the brothers Alexandre and Jules Rene Parant joined and the company became D.F.P Doriot Flandrin & Parant adding a new range using 4-cylinder Chapuis-Dornier engines for 2 litre 10?hp 2.4 litre 12?hp and 2.8 litres 14?hp
D.F.P started to make their own high quality engines in 1912 a high performance version of which was used by W O Bentley at Brooklands
After World War I they used proprietary engines but by 1922 they started to make their own engines again which they supplied to the recently reborn British manufacturer GN until 1923 Production finished in 1926 and the factory was sold by which time Doriot was 62 years old
Doriot died in Menton France in 1955

Der Pfarrer von Kirchfeld

Der Pfarrer von Kirchfeld ÅgThe Priest of KirchfeldÅh is an anti-clerical folkplay by Ludwig Anzengruber in Viennese dialect first produced 5 November 1870 in Vienna It is Anzengruber's most popular drama
Plot
The scene is laid just outside of Austria in the most conservative portion of Old Bavaria among a simple peasantry Ågwhose passions expressed without reservation or but clumsily concealedÅh were a novel revelation of human nature to theatregoers Priest Hell ÅgBrightÅh and his feudal adversary Count Finsterberg ÅgDark-mountainÅh reveal by their very names the nature of the conflict which is precipitated by Hell's innocent gift of a little gold cross to his ward the orphaned penniless Annerl This gives the vagabond Wurselsepp an opportunity to ruin the priest with his parish as an expression of hatred caused by ecclesiastical prevention of his union to a Lutheran girl 20 years before In one scene of the play Hell converts and wins the friendship of this enemy when he permits the burial of Wurzelsepp's suicide mother in consecrated ground But this employment of his own judgment against the law of the Roman Catholic Church loses for him his parish
Though a member of the Ågchurch militant and regnant,Åh Hell had sought like the ÅgMonk of Wittenberg,Åh for a way short of the requirement to inquire ÅgMay I do it just as I mean it?Åh a way which makes men Ågindifferent or apostate.Åh Herein lies a part of the tragedy of his position However he becomes no champion of the ÅgAway from RomeÅh movement which later gained such strength He conquers self and submits More tragic almost to the point of suicide is his love for Annerl who also learns resignation like all Austrians by giving hand and allegiance to the peasant Michel This soul conflict rather than the politico-religious purpose has been cited as the greatest source of appeal for the play
Effect
The play raised a struggling unknown author to fame This has been attributed to the play's freshness and inherent excellence and also to the play's voicing of popular feelings in regard to the celibacy of the clergy mixed unions enforced civil marriage and the relation of church and state as affected by the declaration of papal infallibility in 1870 see First Vatican Council
Productions editions criticism
First produced in the Folktheatre Ågan der Wien,Åh it gradually found its way over all German-speaking lands being played 632 times between 1899 and 1905 The text for the play can be found in volume VI of Anzengruber's Gesammelte Werke ÅgCollected Works,Åh 1898 For a critique see Sigismund Friedmann Ludwig Anzengruber Leipzig 1902


Fab@Home

Fab@Home was the first multi-material 3D printer available to the public and one of the first two open-source DIY 3D printers the other one being the RepRap Up until 2005 all 3D printers were industrial scale expensive and proprietary The high cost and closed nature of the 3D printing industry at the time limited the accessibility of the technology to the masses the range of materials that could be used and the level of exploration that could be done by end-users The goal of the Fab@Home project was to change this situation by creating a versatile low-cost open and ÅghackableÅh printer to accelerate technology innovation and its migration into the consumer and Maker space
Since its open-source release in 2006 hundreds of Fab@Home 3D printers were built across the world and its design elements could be found in many later DIY printers most notably the Makerbot Replicator The printerÅfs multiple syringe-based deposition method allowed for some of the first multi-material prints including direct fabrication of active batteries actuators and sensors as well as esoteric materials for bioprinting and food printing The project was closed in 2012 when it was clear that the projectÅfs goal was achieved and distribution of DIY and consumer printers outpaced the sales of industrial printers for the first time
History
The project was led by students at Cornell University's department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering The effort was inspired by the history of the Altair 8800 one of the first DIY home computer kits released in 1975 The Altair 8800 is largely credited with triggering the home computing revolution and the transition from the industrial mainframe to the consumer desktop by making a low-cost open and ÅghackableÅh computer accessible to home enthusiasts for the first time The goal of the Fab@Home project was to accomplish a similar effect in the 3D printing space The project was one of the first larger scale cases that applied the open source development model to physical devices a process that later became known as Open Source Hardware
Early versions of the device were produced and refined in the lab The first official release of the Fab@Home model 1 coincided with a presentation at the Solid Freeform Fabrication conference in 2006 After its first release undergraduate and graduate students at Cornell and other locations joined the team and developed an improved version later released as the Fab@Home Model 2 The main improvements included easier assembly no soldering and fewer parts The team then expanded and developed the model 3 One important variation of Fab@Home was the Fab@School project which explored the use of 3D printers suitable for classroom use in elementary grades Fab@School printers could print with benign materials such as Play-Doh and included a safety enclosure
The project received wide media attention in its initial years bringing 3D printing from a relatively obscure technology to broader attention Notable recognition was the Popular Mechanics Breakthrough award and the Rapid Prototyping Journal best paper of the year award
Technical abilities
The Fab@Home is a syringe-based deposition system An X-Y-Z gantry system moves a syringe pump across a 20Å~20Å~20?cm 7.87x7.87x7.87 inch build volume at a maximum speed of 10?mm/s and resolution of 25?É m Multiple syringes can be controlled independently to deposit material through syringe tips The syringe displacement could be controlled with microliter precision
The first version of Fab@Home print head had two syringes later version had more syringes up to one print head that had eight syringes that could be used simultaneously
One of the key advantages of using a syringe based deposition method was that a broad range of materials could be deposited essentially any liquid paste gel or slurry that could be squeezed through a syringe tip That versatility allowed going beyond printing just in thermoplastics as did the RepRap and most consumer-scale 3D printers that followed The range of materials that could be printed with a Fab@Home included hard materials such as epoxy elastomers such as silicone biological materials such as cell-seeded hydrogels food materials such as chocolate cookie dough and cheese engineering materials such as stainless steel later sintered in an oven and active materials such as conductive wires and magnets
The stated technical goal of the project was to print a complete active system going beyond printing just passive parts The project succeeded in printing active devices such as batteries actuators sensors and even a working telegraph machine


Gigabit Squared

Gigabit Squared LLC is a digital economic development corporation that specializes in the planning implementation and rollout of communications infrastructure Unlike incumbent telecommunications providers in the United States who typically own and operate networks in addition to providing wholesale and retail Internet access services Gigabit Squared designs and builds networks but does not always finance operate and maintain those networks
Programs
Based near Cleveland Ohio the company was founded in October 2010
In May 2012 Gigabit Squared raised $200 million in venture funding to fund high-speed Internet access projects in the United States
The founders include Mark Ansboury president and Robert Jennings executive vice president Armando Stettner joined in January 2013 as vice president of architecture and technology but left before year-end when it became apparent funding plans had fallen through
The University Community Next Generation Innovation Project Gig.U a coalition of 30 universities headed by Blair Levin helped select the projects
Announced in May 2012 the Gigabit Neighborhood Gateway Program intends to bring gigabit-per-second Internet access to up to six university communities in the United States The project is open to university communities who needed to apply to the project Instead of committing funds to a project communities were asked to commit to help lower costs of deployment and smooth regulatory barriers to deploying a network This is similar to the agreement Google Fiber struck with Kansas City Kansas and Kansas City Missouri
In October 2012 the University of Chicago in partnership with the State of Illinois and the City of Chicago announced the Gigabit Chicago project with Gigabit Squared to bring gigabit-speed fiber to over 4,825 residents businesses schools and healthcare institutions in the ChicagoÅfs Mid-South Side neighborhoods
The state awarded $2 million to Gigabit Squared as part of the Illinois Gigabit Communities Challenge The University of Chicago has committed $2 million and Gigabit Squared $5 million for Gigabit Chicago Gigabit squared entered into an agreement with the City of Chicago and also obtained a $2 million grant However this project is running into problems according to the David Roeder spokesman for the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity Gigabit Squared has repeatedly lied about its intentions
Announced December 13 2012 Gigabit Seattle is a fiber-to-the-home / fiber-to-the-business network being deployed in Seattle Washington The network comes out of a partnership between the City of Seattle the University of Washington and Gigabit Squared In January 2014 the partnership with Seattle was declared dead by new mayor Ed Murray who noted that the company had not raised sufficient money and owed the city over $50,000 in unpaid bills


Gronningen Copenhagen

Gronningen is a street in central Copenhagen Denmark connecting Bredgade and the intersecting street Esplanaden to Oslo Plads in front of Osterport Station along the southwestern margin of the fortification Kastellet It lends its name to the artists cooperative Gronningen which was originally based in the street
History
The triangular area between Esplanaden Store Kongensgade Nyboder and Kastellet was previously home to a Guard Hussars barracks At the turn of the 20th century it was decided to demolish the outdated installation to make way for high-end apartment buildings A competition was held and a plan for redevelopment of the area was adopted by the city on 29 June 1903 A broad boulevard inspired by those of Haussmann in Paris replaced the outer moat of Kastellet and the smaller streets in the area were all named after localities associated with the island of Bornholm The plan required all apartments facing Gronningen to have between six and 12 rooms while the rest of the apartments should have at least five rooms
Construction began at the southern end of the street in 1905 and afterwards the buildings closest to Osterport Station followed After that sale of the expensive lots came to a standstill due to a surplus of apartments in the city at that time In 1908 Copenhagen had a population of 400,000 and 10,000 vacant apartments
A group of artists who had broken with Den Frie Udstilling received permission to erect an intermistic pavilion in one of the empty lots and took the name Gronningen after the street The architect Carl Petersen designed the building which became colloquially known as The Indian Cottage due to its eclectic style It was pulled down after a few years and the artists had to find new premises elsewhere when interest in developing the lots resumed
Architecture
The stately apartment building on the corner of Gronningen and Esplanaden 1 Gronningen was completed in 1906 to designs by Henning Hansen It has two small towers flanking the main entrance The building was expanded northwards by the same architect in 1933 3a-b Gronningen
The building at the other end of the street 21-25 Gronningen is the former headquarters of Nordisk Livsforsikring Selskab English Nordic Life Inssurance Company It was built in 1910 by Axel Preisler and was renovated in 2006 It now serves as head office for M Goldschmidt Holding The large neighbouring property at No 17-19 is the former headquarters of Nordisk Livsforsikrings-Aktieselskab af 1897 and was built from 1913-1914 to designs by Vilhelm Fischer completed by N.P.P Gundstrup
No 11 was built by Carl Brummer in 1918 for the financier Paul Hagemanns It now serves as Finland's embassy
Built in 1935?36 to designs by Ib Lunding the apartment building at Nr 7-9 is in spite of its robust Functionalist style known as the Champaign House due to its irregularly placed windows of the staircase It was heritage listed in 1997
Sculptures
At 25 Gronningen stands Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen's Pegasus statue which commemorates her husband the composer Carl Nielsen
The grassy area on the east side of the street features a bronze copy of Theobald Stein's Neapolitan Fisher Boy with Pitcher from 1901 It was a donation from Carl Jacobsen's Albertina Foundation
A small triangular greenspace sponsored by M Goldschmidt Holding was created in front of the company's head office on the corner of Gronningen and Store Kongensgade It includes a bronze statue of the titan Atlas which was originally commissioned by Carl Jacobsen from the sculptor Nicolai Schmidt in 1899 It has previously decorated the roof of Carlsberg's building in Copenhagen Freeport and later the Central Machine Building in the Carlsberg neighbourhood The sculpture is used in M Goldschmidt's logo


Brandywine Asset Management

Brandywine Asset Management Inc is an American investment management firm founded and managed by Michael Dever The firm is registered as a commodity trading advisor
History
Michael Dever began personal discretionary trading in 1979
Dever founded Brandywine Asset Management Inc in 1982 and Brandywine continued trading futures on a discretionary basis
In the 1980s Dever began developing computer studies on commodity price behavior The basic research and portfolio modeling concepts Brandywine uses today were developed through a major research project conducted from 1987 to 1991 using staff researchers and students and faculty from several universities including the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Villanova University and West Chester University The purpose of these studies was to test all of the ideas that Dever had accumulated to determine if they were statistically valid
Beginning in 1989 Brandywine developed the Brandywine Benchmark Program which Brandywine traded 1991-1998 The Brandywine Benchmark Program was a broadly diversified fully computerized program which incorporated trend-following seasonal arbitrage and fundamentally based strategies The Brandywine Benchmark Program averaged 20% annualized returns throughout the 1990s The Brandywine Benchmark Program stopped trading in late 1998 as Dever began to focus on his venture development business
Dever is a pioneer in risk management and is credited with the development of one of the earliest comprehensive risk management models In the 1980s he developed a statistically based money management and risk allocation model The purpose of the model was to allocate weightings equally to the strategies and markets within a portfolio in order to maintain balance of returns from all strategy-market combinations The intent of this portfolio allocation model is to ensure that no single market or strategy-market combination dominates the portfolio over an extended period of time Since that time elements of this trading model have become popularized as risk parity investing In 1991 this model was incorporated in the Brandywine Benchmark Program which was the first trading program to use risk parity portfolio management
During the years 1999-2007 Brandywine traded multiple strategies and programs including mutual fund arbitrage market neutral equity long-short equity and futures strategies In addition Brandywine's allocation to venture capital investing grew to over 50% of its business
Brandywine has built an attractive track record and has achieved good risk-adjusted returns with consistent performance over time
Brandywine believes in the dynamic nature of markets and the importance of taking an active approach to research The firm is built on a structure and a philosophy that requires continuous identification and development of new strategies for portfolio diversification
The offices of Brandywine are located in an award-winning renovated 17th century grist mill in the Brandywine Valley outside of Philadelphia Pennsylvania The mill renovation project which includes an actual reconstructed operating mill waterwheel was designed by Thomas Dever principal of Dever Architects and brother of Michael The project was awarded a 1997 Building Excellence Award by the Philadelphia Business Journal
Current Status
Brandywine's trading approach is fundamentally based yet systematically applied
The Brandywine Symphony Program was launched in July 2011 and is based on Brandywine's 30+ years of trading experience The program follows a systematic fundamental approach that combines multiple systematic trading strategies into a broadly diversified managed futures portfolio
Brandywine's trading focuses solely on futures because futures offer the broadest diversification with one investment type
The Brandywine Symphony Program trades in more than 100 futures markets and incorporates multiple independent trading strategies Brandywine systematically trades each of these strategies individually and the performance of each strategy contributes to the overall program performance The key to Brandywine's performance is how the systems all interrelate in the overall portfolio
Investment Philosophy
Brandywine is considered to be one of the most diversified futures money managers in the world The two cornerstones of Brandywine's investment approach are diversification and non-correlation of strategies and markets Brandywine implements a multi-strategy approach which is unique in the industry Brandywine's philosophy is to create a relatively hedged portfolio not by buying hedges which cost a premium but by incorporating multiple trading strategies in the portfolio which complement each other Brandywine follows a methodology based on return drivers to trade broadly diversified portfolios in the global currency interest rate stock index metals energy and agricultural futures markets A return driver is the core underlying reason that drives the price of a market Brandywine's investment philosophy is based on the belief that the most consistent persistent and predictable investment returns across a variety of market environments are best achieved by combining multiple uncorrelated trading strategies each designed to profit from a logical distinct return driver into a truly diversified portfolio Each strategy must have a high significance of occurring in the future
Brandywine's trading philosophy is based on broad strategy and market diversification
True diversification can only be achieved by diversifying across return drivers and trading strategies not asset classes Most investors are taught to build a portfolio based on asset classes such as stocks and bonds and to hold the positions for the long term According to Dever this approach is the equivalent of gambling
Brandywine focuses on the permanence of trading strategies and seeks to develop strategies with a strong probability of remaining valid over time a generation or more Dever does not have confidence in short term technically driven strategies because he believes these strategies are not based on sound return drivers and in most cases are random
A trading strategy has two components a system that exploits a return driver and a market that is best suited to capture the returns promised by the return driver
Brandywine's investment process is based on the scientific method and includes the following primary elements
Brandywine minimizes event risk Diversified portfolios are subject to far lower event risk than conventional portfolios Leverage can even be added to a diversified portfolio and the diversified portfolio would still have less event risk and volatility than a conventional portfolio allocated to stocks 60% and bonds 40% Brandywine's philosophy is to incorporate as many diversified return drivers as possible in the portfolio so that they are not all subject to the same external events
Dever believes that drawdowns are the largest impediment to strong positive returns over time


Lyapunov optimization

This article describes Lyapunov optimization for dynamical systems It gives an example application to optimal control in queueing networks
Introduction
Lyapunov optimization refers to the use of a Lyapunov function to optimally control a dynamical system Lyapunov functions are used extensively in control theory to ensure different forms of system stability The state of a system at a particular time is often described by a multi-dimensional vector A Lyapunov function is a nonnegative scalar measure of this multi-dimensional state Typically the function is defined to grow large when the system moves towards undesirable states System stability is achieved by taking control actions that make the Lyapunov function drift in the negative direction towards zero
Lyapunov drift is central to the study of optimal control in queueing networks A typical goal is to stabilize all network queues while optimizing some performance objective such as minimizing average energy or maximizing average throughput Minimizing the drift of a quadratic Lyapunov function leads to the
backpressure routing algorithm for network stability also called the max-weight algorithm
Adding a weighted penalty term to the Lyapunov drift and minimizing the sum leads to the drift-plus-penalty algorithm for joint network stability and penalty minimization
The drift-plus-penalty procedure can also be used to compute solutions to convex programs and linear programs
Lyapunov drift for queueing networks
Consider a queueing network that evolves in discrete time with normalized time slots t in {0 1 2 Åc} Suppose there are N queues in the network and define the vector of queue backlogs at time t by
formula_1
Quadratic Lyapunov functions
For each slot t define L(t as the sum of the squares of the current queue backlogs divided by 2 for convenience later
formula_2
This function is a scalar measure of the total queue backlog in the network It is called quadratic Lyapunov function on the queue state Define the Lyapunov drift as the change in this function from one slot to the next
formula_3
Bounding the Lyapunov drift
Suppose the queue backlogs change over time according to the following equation
formula_4
where a_i(t and b_i(t are arrivals and service opportunities respectively in queue i on slot t This equation can be used to compute a bound on the Lyapunov drift for any slot t
formula_5
Rearranging this inequality summing over all i and dividing by 2 leads to
formula_6
where B(t is defined
formula_7
Suppose the second moments of arrivals and service in each queue are bounded so that there is a finite constant B>0 such that for all t and all possible queue vectors Q(t the following property holds
formula_8
Taking conditional expectations of Eq 1 leads to the following bound on the conditional expected Lyapunov drift
formula_9
A basic Lyapunov drift theorem
In many cases the network can be controlled so that the difference between arrivals and service at each queue satisfies the following property for some real number formula_10
formula_11
If the above holds for the same epsilon for all queues i all slots t and all possible vectors Q(t then Eq 2 reduces to the drift condition used in the following Lyapunov drift theorem The theorem below can be viewed as a variation on Foster's theorem for Markov chains However it does not require a Markov chain structure
formula_12
Suppose there are constants formula_13 such that for all t and all possible vectors Q(t the conditional Lyapunov drift satisfies
formula_14
Then for all slots t>0 the time average queue size in the network satisfies
formula_15
formula_16
Taking expectations of both sides of the drift inequality and using the law of iterated expectations yields
formula_17
Summing the above expression over formula_18 and using the law of telescoping sums gives
formula_19
Using the fact that L(t is non-negative and rearranging the terms in the above expression proves the result
Lyapunov optimization for queueing networks
Consider the same queueing network as in the above section Now define p(t as a network penalty incurred on slot t Suppose the goal is to stabilize the queueing network while minimizing the time average of p(t For example to stabilize the network while minimizing time average power p(t can be defined as the total power incurred by the network on slot t
To treat problems of maximizing the time average of some desirable reward r(t the penalty can be defined p(t = -r(t This is useful for maximizing network throughput utility subject to stability
To stabilize the network while minimizing the time average of the penalty p(t network algorithms can be designed to make control actions that greedily minimize a bound on the following drift-plus-penalty expression on each slot t
formula_20
where V is a non-negative weight that is chosen as desired to affect a performance tradeoff A key feature of this approach is that it typically does not require knowledge of the probabilities of the random network events such as random job arrivals or channel realizations Choosing V = 0 reduces to minimizing a bound on the drift every slot and for routing in multi-hop queueing networks reduces to the backpressure routing algorithm developed by Tassiulas and Ephremides Using V>0 and defining p(t as the network power use on slot t leads to the drift-plus-penalty algorithm for minimizing average power subject to network stability developed by Neely Using V>0 and using p(t as -1 times an admission control utility metric leads to the drift-plus-penalty algorithm for joint flow control and network routing developed by Neely Modiano and Li
A generalization of the Lyapunov drift theorem of the previous section is important in this context For simplicity of exposition assume the penalty p(t is lower bounded by some possibly negative real number p_min
formula_21
For example the above is satisfied with p_min=0 in cases when the penalty p(t is always non-negative
Let p* represent a desired target for the time average of p(t Let V be a parameter used to weight the importance of meeting the target The following theorem shows that if a drift-plus-penalty condition is met then the time average penalty is at most O(1/V above the desired target while average queue size is O(V The V parameter can be tuned to make time average penalty as close to or below the target as desired with a corresponding queue size tradeoff
formula_22
Suppose there are constants formula_23 such that for all t and all possible vectors Q(t the following drift-plus-penalty condition holds
formula_24
Then for all t>0 the time average penalty and time average queue sizes satisfy
formula_16
Taking expectations of Eq 3 and using the law of iterated expectations gives
formula_28
Summing the above over the first t slots and using the law of telescoping sums gives
formula_29
Since L(t and Q_i(t are non-negative quantities it follows that
formula_30
Dividing the above by Vt and rearranging terms proves the time average penalty bound A similar argument proves the time average queue size bound


Phasor approach to fluorescence lifetime and spectral imaging

Phasor approach refers to a method which is used for vectorial representation of sinusoidal waves like alternative currents and voltages or electromagnetic waves The amplitude and the phase of the waveform is transformed into a vector where the phase is translated to the angle between the phasor vector and X axis and the amplitude is translated to vector length or magnitude
In this concept the representation and the analysis becomes very simple and the addition of two wave forms is realized by their vectorial summation
In Fluorescence lifetime and spectral imaging phasor can be used to visualize the spectra and decay curves In this method the Fourier transformation of the spectrum or decay curve is calculated and the resulted complex number is plotted on a 2D plot where the X axis represents the Real component and the Y axis represents the Imaginary component This facilitate the analysis since each spectrum and decay is transformed into a unique position on the phasor plot which depends on its spectral width or emission maximum or to its average lifetime The most important feature of this analysis is that it is fast and it provides a graphical representation of the measured curve
Temporal phasor
If we have decay curve which is represented by an exponential function with lifetime of É—
formula_1
Then the Fourier transformation at frequency É÷ is represented by the Lorentz function
formula_2
This is a complex function and drawing the Imaginary versus real part of this function for all possible lifetimes will be a semicircle where the zero lifetime is located at 1,0 and the infinite lifetime located at 0,0 By changing the lifetime from zero to infinity the phasor point moves along a semicircle from 1,0 to 0,0 This suggest that by taking the Fourier transformation of a measured decay curve and mapping the result on the phasor plot the lifetime can be estimated from the position of the phasor on the semicircle
Explicitly the lifetime can be measured from the magnitude of the phasor as follow
formula_3
This is a very fast approach compared to methods where they use fitting to estimate the lifetime
Multi-exponential cases
The semicircle is to express the single exponential lifetimes when the measured decay curve shows the superposition of different lifetimes then the phasor falls inside the semicircle depending on its fractions from principal lifetimes.For a bi-exponential case with lifetimes of É—1 and É—2 and fraction of alpha The total phasor falls on a line connecting the phasors of É—1 and É—2 on the semicircle and the distance from the phasor of É—1 determines the alpha Having an image with two components with lifetimes of É—1 and É—2 the phasor of image pixels are distributed on a line connecting the phasor of É—1 and É—2 Fitting a line through all these phasor points with slope v and interception u will give two intersections with semicircle which determines the lifetimes of É—1 and É—2 by
formula_4
This is a blind solution for unmixing of two components based on their lifetimes.Provided that the lifetimes of each individual component show a single exponential behavior
Compatibility to different gate configurations
For a system with discrete number of gates and limited time window the phasor approach needs to be adopted The equation for reference semicircle is changed to
formula_5
Where K is the number of gates and T is the total measurement window The average lifetimes are calculated by
And for a binary case after fitting a line through the data set of phasors and finding the slope v and interception u the lifetimnes are calculated by
formula_6
Effect of instrument response
In a non-ideal and real situations the measured decay curve is the convolution of the instrument response the laser pulse distorted by system with an exponential function which makes the analysis more complicated Large number of techniques have been developed to overcome to this problem but in phasor approach this is simply solved by the fact that the Fourier transformation of a convolution is the product of Fourier transforms This allows to take into account the effect of instrument response by taking the Fourier transformation of instrument response function and dividing the total phasor to instrument response transformation
Spectral phasor
Similar to temporal phasor the Fourier transformation of spectra can be used to make phasor Considering a Gaussian spectrum with zero spectral width and changing the emission maximum from channel zero to K the phasor rotates on a circle from small angles to larger angles This corresponds to shift theorem of Fourier transformation Changing the spectral width from zero to infinity moves the phasor toward center This means that the phasor for background signal which can be considered as a spectrum with infinite spectral width is located at center of phasor with coordinate of 0,0
Linear property of the phasor approach
One of the interesting property of the phasor approach is the linearity where the superposition of different spectra or decay curves can be analyzed by vectorial superposition of individual phasors This is demonstrated in the figure where adding two spectra with different emission maximum resulted in a phasor which falls on a line connecting the phasors of individual phasors For a ternary system adding 3 spectra falls inside a triangle made by phasors of individual spectra or decays
Unmixing of Three components
For a system which has three different components and they show different spectra the phasor of the pixeles with different fractional intensities fall inside a triangle where the verti are made up by phasor of pure components The fractional intensities then can be estimated by measuring the area of the triangle that each phasor makes with the phasor of pure vertix
Reciprocal property
This another interesting feature there is a one to one correlation between the pixels in the image and their phasors on the phasor plot depending on their spectrum or decay curve The phasors for pixels with similar temporal-spectral properties fall on a similar regions and this provide a mean for sorting the image pixels according to their temporal-spectral properties By making region of interest on phasor plot a reciprocal transformation can be performed and the phasors can be projected back to the image which allows a basic segmentation

Adeel loses his job due to down-sizing and struggles for another job Situation worsens Adeel turns bitter due to job hunting Affan falls sick Ahmer accidentally helps out Sila Sila takes up a job in Ahmer's company to help Adeel - this hurts Adeel's ego and Zoya creates misunderstanding between Adeel and Sila Sila tries hard to sort the issues between her and Adeel but Adeel who considers Zoya a good fried does not believe Sila Affan's death shatters Sila who blames Adeel for her kids death and leaves Adeel's house
Meanwhile Zoya is making the most of this opportunity to corner Adeel and get him to marry her Although Adeel wants to be left on his own Zoya carries on visiting him Adeel overhears Zoya's wish to marry him as she discusses that overtly with her mother Adeel responds to this by later proposing to Zoya Meanwhile Sila at her parents home living with her mother is ready to accept and inherit her late fathers wealth Sila gives birth to a baby of Adeel and she names him Afaan Sila decides not to tell her only child about his real father
Five years later Sila is now successfully in charge of her late fathers business and is expanding her business with the help of family friends Nabeela Sami and Ahmer as well as the support of her mother On the other hand Zoya and Adeel are living through a rocky relationship and they have no children as a result of Zoya's fertility issues When Adeels company acquires new management he and Zoya as well as other staff couples are invited to an evening dinner to meet the new management team The new managers are Sila and Ahmer Upon seeing and discovering this Zoya and Adeel are left in shock
Nabila and Sami were initially Adeel's friends but upon hearing what he had done to Sila they turned their backs on him Adeel goes to their house to defend himself He says that,"Sila left the house herself I didn't tell her to leave Affan's death was just an excuse to leave as she wanted to leave before She wanted to go with that Ahmer But one thing is true I still love her She doesn't leave my mind even for a second
Meanwhile Sila is listening to all of this by hearing through the window She leaves in tears and Nabila insults Adeel and tells him to leave her house
Zoya and her mother make a plan to tell Adeel that bring Sila back so that Zoya can get money and become rich But Adeel refuses firmly Adeel and Sila constantly meet by co-incidence in malls in elevators Adeel comes to her room in her office and even though Sila tells him to leave he doesn't He says what he said to Sami the other day but he even says something else I never loved Zoya I still love you Why did you leave me and go with that Ahmer Sila screams at him to get out and reluctantly Adeel goes
Adeel is very upset and all he can think about is Silla He says her name in his sleep the whole night Zoya gets very angry because of that and goes to Silla's office and says really mean things to Silla Zoya says that Silla never loved Adeel and now Silla is whole alone missing Adeel But Silla replies that she is not alone she has something Zoya can't even imagine Affaan After this incident Silla fires Adeel Adeel goes to the office to talk to Silla There he sees Silla with Affaan He gets really mad and thinks that Affaan is Ahmers child He comes to Silla's house and insulst her by saying that he didn't know that she could go this far Her relationship with Ahmer and their child Silla says that Affan is not Ahmers child Affan is my child and by bad luck he's yours too Everybody knows that But you you couldn't even recognize your own child Adeel is shocked after hearing this Silla asks him to leave Silla's mom asks Ahmer to make the divorce papers so Silla can move on forget about Adeel and start a new life with Ahmer Silla agrees to sign the papers
Then Adeel comes in front of Silla at street when she's driving her car and makes her stop Silla asks him why he keeps on coming in her way and why he can't just leave Adeels says that he will not only leave her way but he will even leave the city if she only gives him Affaan Silla asks him why he's making this scene in the middle of the road Adeel says that it's not a scene and that she is his wife But Silla says that there is no relation between them That relation ended that day when she left his house Adeel says that it was her own decision to leave the house but Silla replies that there was nothing left for her in that house not her child and not Adeel Adeel says that he still loves her Silla says that she hates him Ahmer comes between them and tells them to talk about their problems at a private place and not in the middle of the road Adeel says that he knows that Silla has decided to start a new life and he says that he's gonna take Affaan away from her Adeel tells Zoya about his child and says that Silla can't take his child away from him He goes to a lawyer The lawyer tells him that it's really difficult because Affaan is a small child And that Adeel hasn't kept any contact with his wife for the past 5 years He didn't give her any money and that he even got married for the second time The only way to get Affaan back is to proof that Silla is a bad woman Adeel leaves He goes to Sammy and tells her that he has lost the battle without fighting because he can't fight against someone he really loves And that the sad thing is that none of them could understand In her eyes I'm the worst person and in my eyes she is guilty But he wants to see Affaan just once and asks Sammy to talk with Silla He promises that he will leave the city afterwards forever Sammy refuses and tells Adeel that he should do that himself
Adeel comes to see Silla at her home And tells her that he wants to talk Silla says that he has already said a lot that day in the middle of the road and how much does he wants to hurt her Adeel says that he never meant to hurt her and that God knows that But he was the reason for all her pain And now he can't even face himself but he wants to apologize to her for all the pain in her life But Silla says that his apologies won't make any difference because they can't bring the time back when she lost everything And that Adeel can't even imagine what she's been through Adeel says that he knows he's not worth it to be forgiven but that every moment without her was a punishment for him he really loved her and only her and that she can't even imagine that Silla replies by saying that it's why he got married to Zoya that fast and gave her the place where I belonged Adeel says that marrying Zoya was his greatest mistake He couldn't understand her and when he did it was too late Silla asks him to stop if he's dong it to meet Affaan because she had thought a lot and thinks that she can't keep Affaan away from his dads love and that he can meet him Adeel says that he doesn't only want Affaan in his life but he wants Silla to come back too And they will start all over But Silla says that he can't forget that he's Zoya's husband And she doesn't want to take him away from Zoya because she's not like her and she doesn't want to be like her either She can't commit the sin to destroy someone's home Adeel says that his house never became a home after she left Silla tells him to be loyal with Zoya That's his punishment She says that she never asked him anything in their life and this is her first and last wish
Adeels love for Silla has grown after this just like his hate for Zoya He tells Zoya how bad she is and how good Silla is And that he never loved her but Silla has bound them in this relationship with her forever And that they will live together as strangers Zoya thinks a lot that night and gets flashbacks about how she made Affaan sick and how she took Adeel away from Silla She cries and realizes her mistake The next day she asks Adeel to divorce her
Meanwhile Ahmer has also prepared the divorce papers for Silla and Adeel Silla tries a lot but she can't sign the papers Ahmer says sorry for taking this test from her Silla says that she knows that she has hurt Ahmer a lot But he says that she didn't he just wishes he could bring her happiness back
Ahmer Silla and Affaan are sitting in a car Ahmer brings them to a park Silla asks him why they are here and Ahmer says that this is her destiny and tells her to turn around Adeel is standing there Ahmer tells Silla to go Silla steps slowly in his direction They look at each other without saying anything The whole title song with all their memories is being played Silla cries Ahmer tells Affaan to go to his parents and Ahmer leaves alone Adeel hugs Affaan and the 3 of them leave at Adeels bike

Resignation of Pope Benedict XVI

The resignation of Pope Benedict XVI occurred on 28 February 2013 at 20:00 8:00 PM CET 19:00/7:00 PM UTC The resignation was first announced on the morning of 11?February 2013 by the Vatican Benedict's decision to step down as leader of the Catholic Church made him the first pope to relinquish the office since Pope Gregory XII in 1415 who did so in order to end the Western Schism and the first to do so on his own initiative since Pope Celestine V in 1294 The move was unexpected given that the modern era popes have held the position from election until death The Pope stated that the reason for his decision was his declining health due to old age The conclave to select his successor began on 12?March 2013 and elected Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio Archbishop of Buenos Aires Argentina who took the name of Francis
Announcement
Benedict announced in February 2013 that due to his advanced age he would step down At the age of 85 years and 318 days on the effective date of his retirement he was the fourth-oldest person to hold the office of pope
He announced his intention to resign in Latin at the Apostolic Palace in the Sala del Concistoro at an early morning gathering on 11 February 2013 which was the World Day of the Sick a Vatican holy day The gathering was to announce the date of the canonisation of 800 Catholic martyrs Antonio Primaldo and companions as well as the Latin American nuns Laura Montoya Upegui and Maria Guadalupe Garcia Zavala At the ceremony known as the Consistory for the canonization of the martyrs of Otranto he told those present he had made a decision of great importance for the life of the church In a statement Benedict cited his deteriorating strength due to old age and the physical and mental demands of the papacy He also declared that he would continue to serve the church through a life dedicated to prayer
Two days after the announcement Benedict presided over his final public Mass Ash Wednesday services that ended with congregants bursting into a deafening standing ovation that lasted for minutes while the pontiff departed St Peter's Basilica On 17 February 2013 Pope Benedict speaking in Spanish requested prayers from the crowd in front of St Peter's Square for himself and the new pope
Post-papacy
According to Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi S.J Pope Benedict XVI will not have the title of Cardinal upon his retirement and will not be eligible to hold any office in the Roman Curia On 26 February 2013 Father Lombardi stated that upon the Pope's resignation his style and title are His Holiness Benedict XVI Roman Pontiff Emeritus or Pope Emeritus He will keep wearing his distinctive white cassock without the mozzetta and without the red papal shoes opting to wear a pair of brown shoes he received during a state visit to Mexico The Cardinal Camerlengo Tarcisio Bertone destroyed the Ring of the Fisherman and the lead seal of the pontificate
Benedict took up residence in the Papal Palace in Castel Gandolfo immediately following his resignation As the Swiss Guard serves as the pope's personal body guard they terminated their service at Castel Gandolfo with the coming into effect of Benedict's resignation The Vatican Gendarmerie ordinarily providing for the security of the Papal summer residence became solely responsible for the personal security of the former Pope Following a renovation Benedict moved permanently to Vatican City's Mater Ecclesiae a monastery previously used by nuns for stays of up to several years at a time on 2 May 2013 According to anonymous Vatican officials Benedict's continued presence in the Vatican City will assist with the provision of security prevent his retirement location from becoming a place of pilgrimage and provide him with legal protection from potential lawsuits
Reactions
Metropolitan Archbishop of Lagos Archbishop Alfred Adewale Martins said of the resignation:We do not have this sort of event happening But at the same time we know that the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1983 makes provision for the resignation of the Pope if he becomes incapacitated or as with Benedict XVI if he believes he is no longer able to effectively carry out his official functions as head of the Roman Catholic Church due to a decline in his physical ability This is not the first time that a Pope would resign In fact we have had not less than three who resigned including Pope Celestine V in 1294 and Pope Gregory XII in 1415 Pope Benedict XVI was not forced into taking that decision Like he said in his own words he acted with Åefull freedom,Åf being conscious of the deep spiritual implication of his action By his decision the Holy Father has acted gallantly and as such we must commend and respect his decision U.S Cardinal Timothy Dolan said that he brought a listening heart to victims of sexual abuse
Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Yona Metzger's spokesman said During his period there were the best relations ever between the church and the chief rabbinate and we hope that this trend will continue I think he deserves a lot of credit for advancing inter-religious links the world over between Judaism Christianity and Islam The spokesman also said that Metzger wished Benedict XVI good health and long days
Tenzin Gyatso the 14th Dalai Lama and spiritual head of the Gelug sect of Tibetan Buddhism expressed sadness over his resignation while noting his decision must be realistic for the greater benefit to concern the people
Final week
Benedict XVI delivered his final Angelus on Sunday 24 February He told the gathered crowd who carried international flags and thanked the pope Thank you for your affection will take up a life of prayer and meditation to be able to continue serving the church The pope appeared for the last time in public during his regular Wednesday audience on 27 February 2013 As of 16 February 35,000 people had already registered to attend the audience On the evening of 27 February there was a candlelight vigil to show support for Pope Benedict XVI at St Peter's Square On his final day as pope Benedict held an audience with the college of Cardinals and at 16:15 4:15 PM local time he boarded a helicopter and flew to Castel Gandolfo There he waited out the final hours of his papacy At about 17:30 5:30 PM he addressed the masses from the balcony for the last time


Alexian Brothers Novitiate

The Alexian Brothers Novitiate is a manor house located in Gresham Shawano County Wisconsin United States Originally built in 1939 as a residence it would be converted into a novitiate for the Alexian Brothers order in 1950 after being donated to them The building ceased to be used as a novitiate after 1968 following the Second Vatican Council and the reforms from it It has since been largely vacated and partially demolished leaving very little of it standing The building is best known for being seized by the Menominee Warrior Society a subset of the American Indian Movement in 1975 with demands that it be turned over to the nearby Menominee Indian Reservation Though successful it ultimately was returned to Gresham where it would be largely forgotten
Early History
The Novitiate was originally a home for a New York widow and her disabled child in 1939 The structure had been built with the intention that it eventually be donated to the Brothers as the late husband had formed a strong connection to them in his youth in Chicago
In 1948 the building was turned over to the Brothers with the final acquisition occurring in 1950 and in 1951 would begin admitting novices The area encompassed approximately 232 acres This building was expanded in 1954 to include a new monastery More land was also purchased in 1955 to provide a farm to feed the novices
Following the reforms of the Second Vatican Council the Brothers ultimately decided to move their operations to Chicago putting the novitiate building up for sale in 1969 with the last brothers moving out in 1972 with only a caretaker staying behind Attempts to sell the property stalled for several years until 1974 when the property was offered to a group of Indians from Green Bay for an unknown nominal cost with the intent of converting it into an alcoholic rehabilitation center However the seizure of the Novitiate in 1975 ended this potential deal
Seizure of the Novitiate
On January 1 1975 an armed group of Menominee Indians called the Menominee Warrior Society seized the property and took the caretaker and his family hostage They demanded that the Novitiate and property be turned over to the Menominee Reservation using claims from an old treaty that allowed them to take unused land The National Guard moved into the area and sealed if off behind several checkpoints Tensions ran high as shots were occasionally exchanged and negotiations largely stalled
Negotiations went nowhere in January as the Brothers refused to hand over the deed except for a reasonable price and the Menominee Warrior Society demanded it be turned over free as they felt it already belonged to them Complicating this further some people in Menominee Gresham and the nearby city of Shawano sympathized with the Society and others didn't wish for the National Guard to be there Vigilante activity was also common making security a difficult task
On February 2 1975 the standoff ended with a deal between the Brothers and the Society Fearing that the incident would end like similar situations at Kent State and Attica Prison the Brothers instead chose to sell the property to the Menominee Reservation for one dollar The standoff ended and the 39 members of the Menominee Warrior Society were arrested
Recent history
Since the standoff the Novitiate has struggled to find a purpose in the area The Menominee Reservation was unable to maintain the building and surrendered their claim to the property within a few months In October 1975 a fire severely damaged the building In November the Brothers turned the area over to Crossroads Academy based out of Milwaukee The land was divided up with 56 acres given to the Town of Richmond to be turned into a park Since then the area has changed hands many times though no substantive improvements have occurred
Documentary and Book
In 2001 former Alexian Brother novice J Patrick Rick created a short documentary film called The Novitiate about the property and 1975 takeover followed by a book called The Abbey & Me in 2011

Distinguished Warfare Medal

The Distinguished Warfare Medal was a planned United States military decoration announced by former U.S Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta on 13 February 2013 It would have been the first American combat-related award to be created since the Bronze Star Medal in 1944 The blue red and white-ribboned medal was to be awarded to individuals for extraordinary achievement related to a military operation occurring after 11 September 2001 It was intended to recognize military achievement in cyberwarfare or combat drone operations for actions that did not include valor in combat
Reception for the medal was mixed with veterans criticizing the placement of the medal in the order of precedence.</ref> Production of the medal was halted on 12 March 2013 pending a review of its precedence as ordered by Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel It was subsequently cancelled by Secretary Hagel on 15 April 2013 who made the decision to instead create and offer a new distinguishing device to existing medals
Criteria
The intention of the Distinguished Warfare Medal involved recognizing - in the name of the Secretary of Defense - extraordinary achievement by members of the United States Armed Forces Such achievement would have taken place after 11 September 2001 and need not have involved acts of valor The criteria required that the qualifying achievement must have had a direct impact through any domain on combat or other military operations
These operations must have occurred under one of the following circumstances
The achievement would have had to have had such an outstanding or exceptional nature as to set the individual apart from peers serving in similar duties or situations The medal was only to be awarded for single exemplary acts and would not have been awarded for sustained operational service The Distinguished Warfare Medal could have been awarded posthumously
Additional awards of the Distinguished Warfare Medal would be shown with oak leaf clusters for U.S Army and U.S Air Force awardees and with 5/16 inch stars for U.S Navy U.S Marine Corps and U.S Coast Guard awardees
Prior to cancellation the service secretaries had not completed developing the criteria for the medal for each of their military services The awarding criteria would have been included in the next Manual of Military Decorations and Awards
Appearance
The Distinguished Warfare Medal was to consist of a 1 7/8 inch bronze medallion The obverse would have depicted a grid lined globe surrounded by a laurel wreath Superimposed over the globe is the eagle from the Seal of the United States Department of Defense in front of a lozenge The top of the medallion is surmounted by a six-pointed star The reverse continues the laurel wreath design surmounted by a six-pointed star In the center is a blank space for engraving the recipients name Above the space is the inscription DISTINGUISHED WARFARE below is the inscription DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
The medallion would have been borne by a light blue ribbon with dark blue edges In the center would have been two white stripes bordered by red on their outsides and dark blue on the inside
The symbolism of the medal would have stated as the following
Designed by the United States Army Institute of Heraldry it was reviewed by the United States Commission of Fine Arts
Reception
The medal's order of precedence was criticized by the Veterans of Foreign Wars The commander of this organization John Hamilton explained It is very important to properly recognize all who faithfully serve and excel but this new medal ? no matter how well intended ? could quickly deteriorate into a morale issue Medals that can only be earned in direct combat must mean more than medals awarded in the rear The Military Order of the Purple Heart joined in condemnation stating To rank what is basically an award for meritorious service higher than any award for heroism is degrading and insulting to every American Combat Soldier Airman Sailor or Marine who risks his or her life and endures the daily rigors of combat in a hostile environment The Military Order of the Purple Heart strongly urges the newly appointed Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to either reconsider the precedence of the Distinguished Warfare Medal or develop another way to recognize the achievements of those whose indirect actions contribute greatly to the accomplishment of the mission without diminishing the sacrifice of life and limb by those who confront the enemy firsthand on the battlefield The Association of the United States Navy also expressed criticism of the medal's placement stating While AUSN supports the medal itself as well as the achievements and importance of the cyber warfare community the concern lies with the ranking of the medal Doug Sterner military medals expert and curator of the Military Times Hall of Valor expressed confusion saying I understand the need to recognize the guys at the console who are doing some pretty important things But to see it ranking above the Bronze Star with V Nick McDowell a member of the Orders and Medals Society of American said that an alternative to adding a new medal could be adding a new ribbon device to an existing medal and said that The problem is that we're adding another non-valor personal decoration into a system that is already crowded with non-valor personal decorations
Outgoing Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta defended the award's precedence saying Our military reserves its highest decorations obviously for those who display gallantry and valor in actions when their lives are on the line and we will continue to do so But we should also have the ability to honor the extraordinary actions that make a true difference in combat operations The contribution they make does contribute to the success of combat operations particularly when they remove the enemy from the field of battle even if those actions are physically removed from the fight Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Nate Christensen added Extraordinary achievement directly impacting combat operations at this level deserves to be recognized with a distinctive medal not a device on an existing medal The DWM is visionary in that it fills a need for a non-valorous combat impact medal
On 26 February three military veteran congressmen Duncan D Hunter Tom Rooney and Tim Murphy introduced legislation in the House of Representatives to reduce the precedence of the medal by banning it from being rated equal to or above the Purple Heart At the time of the medal's cancellation that bill had gained 124 cosponsors while a corresponding bill introduced in the Senate on 6 March had gained 31 cosponsors
Cancellation
On 12 March 2013 it was reported that the Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel ordered a review of the medal and its initial place in the order of precedence On 15 April he announced its cancellation noting that it would be an unnecessary medal Initially it was speculated that the precedence order of the medal would be lowered from its current position above the Purple Heart and Bronze Star Medal Instead Hagel announced that the medal would be replaced by a new distinguishing device that could be attached to an existing medal or service ribbon.</ref>

The Transalpin is an EuroCity express train linking Zurich Switzerland with Graz Austria via Liechtenstein Introduced in 2013 it is operated by the Austrian Federal Railways OBB and the Swiss Federal Railways SBB-CFF-FFS From 1958 to 2010 a train of the same name linked Basel or Zurich with Vienna see history below
The name of the train alludes to the fact that it crosses the Alps Transalpin was also the Ancient Roman word meaning behind the Alps and referring to the region of that name in northern Switzerland
Route
The train takes 9 h 34 min from Zurich to Graz 9 h 35 min in the other direction and stops at Sargans Buchs SG Feldkirch Bludenz Langen am Arlberg St Anton am Arlberg Landeck-Zams Imst-Pitztal Otztal Innsbruck Jenbach Worgl Kirchberg in Tirol Kitzbuhel St Johann in Tirol Saalfelden Zell am See Schwarzach-St Veit St Johann im Pongau Bischofshofen Radstadt Schladming Stainach-Irdning Liezen Selzthal St Michael in Obersteiermark and Leoben In Buchs SG border checkpoint and Selzthal the train changes its direction of travel
Train formation
In the timetable period 2013/2014 the EC Transalpin is composed of one first class open coach of the SBB CFF FFS the other coaches are of the OBB including a dining car and a combine baggage car with first class seats allowing to transport bicycles In second class both compartment coaches and open coaches are offered
Between Zurich and Buchs the train is usually pulled by a locomotive of SBB CFF FFS class Re 420 Between Buchs and Graz a locomotive of OBB class 1016 or 1116 is used
History
The Transalpin was first introduced in 1958 it was operated by the Austrian Federal Railways OBB and the Swiss Federal Railways SBB-CFF-FFS For most of its life it ran between Wien Westbf in Vienna Austria and Basel SBB in Switzerland In 1987 it was designated a EuroCity train In 2008 it was cut back from Basel SBB to Zurich HB Switzerland It was discontinued in June 2010 and replaced by a Railjet service
From 1 June 1958 until 13 June 2010 the Transalpin was a showpiece of the OBB and the SBB Introduced the year after the Trans Europ Express TEE network was set up in 1957 it had both first- and second-class accommodation and therefore did not meet the first class only requirements to be a TEE
Throughout its history the Transalpin ran daily in both directions Until the 2000s it was always one of the fastest railway connections with the fewest intermediate stops in its area of operation
The initial train numbers of the Transalpin were TS 11/12 and its original route was Wien Westbf to Zurich HB In 1959 the route was extended to Basel SBB station When it became a EuroCity train in 1987 its train numbers became EC 62 westbound and EC 63 eastbound
To save time and the need for the train to reverse direction during its journey the Transalpin did not stop at Salzburg Hauptbahnhof initially but ran via the curve from Elixhausen to Salzburg-Gnigl and stopped at Salzburg Aigen Even today this curve which is now used mainly by goods trains is known by the name Transalpin-Schleife Transalpin curve
In 1969 the route was changed From then onwards the Transalpin ran from the Western Railway at Salzburg Hbf to Worgl via the Deutsche Bundesbahn DB)?owned Rosenheim?Salzburg and Rosenheim?Kufstein railways instead of along the previous route via Bischofshofen and Zell am See Gisela railway As the Transalpin had no scheduled stops in Germany it was operated there as a so-called Korridorzug or privilege train a train in which in the period before the Schengen Agreement the passport and customs checks that would otherwise be required were not applicable Until the construction of the in 1982 the train had be reversed at Rosenheim
In 1975 a writer for Fodor's travel guides described the Transalpin as one of the best trains in Europe for mountain scenery
In 1980 a trip on the Transalpin from Zurich to Vienna was featured in Changing Trains the final episode in Series 1 of Great Railway Journeys of the World a BBC TV travel documentary The Changing Trains trip which formed part of a longer journey from Paris to Budapest was also described in the book published to complement the series Eric Robson the presenter and author of Changing Trains commented that the Transalpin as of 1980 was simply the best train that the OBB had to offer the star of this single main line to the east
When the EuroCity network was launched on 31 May 1987 the Transalpin was among the previously existing international express trains to be redesignated as EuroCity trains
In June 2010 the Transalpin was replaced by the Railjet 162 and Railjet 163 which run to approximately the same timetable In the timetable period 2013/2014 five pairs of Railjets connect Zurich and Vienna
Route historic
In 2009/2010 the route of the Transalpin was as follows
The train reversed its direction at Buchs SG In the westbound EC 162 the first-class cars were marshalled at the front of the train from Buchs to Zurich and in the eastbound OBB-EC 163 they were at the front of the train from Buchs to Vienna This arrangement meant that at the two termini both of which were terminal stations the first-class cars were always closer to the station concourse
At times when there were interruptions on the Arlberg line due to railway construction work or as a consequence of natural disasters ? such as avalanches and debris flows or between August and December 2005 after storm damage ? the Transalpin was substantially diverted between Salzburg and Bregenz via Munchen Hbf and the Bavarian Allgau railway
Train formation historic
Initially the Transalpin was operated by a four-member fleet of four-car electric multiple units which had been procured specifically for the purpose The Class 4130 was a development of the Class 4030 but had a higher capacity and top speed and its control car was equipped with a kitchen
In 1965 the OBB replaced the Transalpin"'s Class 4130s with three six-car multiple units which again had been procured specifically for the purpose
In May 1977 the Class 4010s were replaced with a locomotive-hauled train formation consist
On the first day of the new arrangement 21 May the Transalpin consisted of an OBB Class 1042 electric locomotive five OBB Schlieren coaches one DB WRumh restaurant car ex-"Rheingold and six additional OBB Schlieren coaches
From the following day 22 May 1977 the train now operating as Ex 462/463 was made up of 12 OBB Z1 Eurofima coaches one WRumh and three DB RIC coaches
On the ascending grades of the Arlberg railway the eastbound locomotive-hauled train often received assistance from a pilot or banking locomotive
In the 1990s an SBB-CFF-FFS first-class panorama car was added to the train

Twelfth Night 1933 film

Twelfth Night is a short color film made in 1933 notable as the very earliest surviving film directed by Orson Welles then aged 17 It is a recording of the dress rehearsal of Welles's own abridged production at his alma mater the Todd School for Boys where he had returned to direct this adaptation of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night for the Chicago Drama Festival in 1933 The play won first prize at that year's festival presented as part of the 1933 Chicago World's Fair A Century of Progress Exposition
Production
After Orson Welles's return from Europe his friend and former headmaster Roger Hill invited him to join the Todd faculty and co-direct the Todd School's production of Twelfth Night Using the edited version of the play that would appear in their book Everybody's Shakespeare 1934 Welles designed the costumes and conceived and created the set The production made use of Kenneth Macgowan's concept of having the stage as a giant open book with the turning pages being changes of scenery painted by Welles himself
Using a color motion picture camera loaned to him by Hill Welles increased the lighting and filmed most of a dress rehearsal ? his very first film Welles operated the camera himself leaving it in a static position in the auditorium A silent film camera was used but Welles later recorded an accompanying narration on a gramophone disc
Hill suggested to Welles that he film the play wrote biographer Frank Brady who viewed the result firsthand
The print that I saw of Orson's Twelfth Night in Roger Hill's living room in Miami a half-century later was still perfectly preserved with rich color and quite professionally focused but without any camera movement or pronounced flourishes or angles It was simply shot from one point of view perhaps from the middle of the tenth row of the theater an amateur recording of the play on film rather than a piece of cinema
The Todd School production of Twelfth Night received the silver cup from the Chicago Drama League after competition at the Century of Progress Exposition in July?August 1933 The cast included Hascy Tarbox as Sir Andrew Aguecheek and Roger Hill's daughter Joanne Hill as Viola The play was presented at the English Village at the Chicago World's Fair
A short film excerpt from it is still in the Hills possession wrote critic Richard France Unfortunately Welles's original staging was not used only his set A small backdrop is completely covered with a bright stylized rendering of a London street
Preservation status
Although the film was believed lost for a while at least one extended fragment of a copy has survived in the private possession of Welles's former teacher and lifelong mentor Roger Hill who produced the play In addition in the 1930s and 1940s copies of the film were available for hire by schools and drama societies
Although it is the earliest surviving footage filmed by Welles it was not the first time he had used a film camera?? he told one biographer that he had first done so when making a silent home movie of a visit to St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican at the age of nine in 1924?25


Southern Backtones

Southern Backtones is an American Southwestern rock band from Houston Texas composed of Hank Schyma Todd Sommer and Chris Goodwin It was formed by Hank Schyma in the late Åf90s and is often described as ÅgBrit-influenced rock with roots planted firmly in Texas,Åh Ågmoody voodoo rock that intertwines with Spaghetti Western and devil-may-care rock Åen roll.Åh They released their first album in 1998 and in the following 15 years theyÅfve been on MTV2 and Much Music collected local accolades and playing with bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd Old 97Åfs and Hayes Carll
History
Formation and First Album
Not much is recorded of the Southern BacktonesÅf early history until their first album Los Tormentos De Amor in 1998 David Taylor and Mykel Foster are cited as essential earlier contributors Los Tormentos de Amor was recorded at SugarHill Recording Studios on 2Åh tape
Recording this album began a working relationship that would carry on throughout the band's career Hank Schyma working with Producer Dan Workman formed the central core that would determine the band's direction Workman is credited not only as producer on the album but with some vocals as well he would later appear in some form or fashion on every consecutive album release to date It was mastered by Rodney Meyers who would also master the following record
The liner notes reference an inside joke ÅgAll bridges burned by Mykel Foster,Åh a reference to the bandÅfs early rockstar attitude and penchant for disruption Their unruly behavior across a number of Texas and Louisiana venues allegedly led to instances where they regained entry to bars on the promise of Ågthat guyÅfs not in the band anymore.Åh The offending member was apparently almost always in attendance at the time The phase would continue until a conversation with Workman would later convince them that Ågthat stuff only works when youÅfre famous.Åh The band would live to shake off their formerly rambunctious ways but not before circulating word of a particularly precipitous incident that happened while headlining a show in New Orleans
LeviÅfs approached the band about using the song Fallen Angel using it as a central point for their Levi's/Stage Stores promotional campaign It resulted in the Southern Backtones touring through 80 towns across Texas in the first ever stretch Hummer playing on top of it in retailer parking lots Footage from these shows ended up as the basis for a LeviÅfs commercial effectively releasing 100,000 copies of the album into distribution along the way
Second Album
The second album The Formula was completed and pressed in 2002 Dan Workman again produced and appeared on it It is now considered by the band to be an unsatisfying experience and never released despite some positive reviews Only three tracks from the session would be later be made available as Unreleased Studio Tracks
The Blue EP
When the band returned to SugarHill Recording Studios they were joined for the first time by Grammy winning Engineer Steve Christensen who in addition to Workman would be involved with each successive release Robbie Parrish served as Drum Tech for the EP as well as the resulting full length album He worked with Todd Sommer a new drummer that would remain throughout the bandÅfs life
This would also mark their introduction to Dan WorkmanÅfs Casio SK-1 a small sampling keyboard originally intended as a toy but would later end up on every release to date Stringed arrangements were also added to expand the new sound Kevin Ryan co-author of Recording the Beatles composed the arrangements that would surface on these recordings played by accomplished violinist Nikola Augsburger
The process was facilitated by the contributions of John Griffin a guitarist for the band who funded much of the record urging them to Ågspare no expense.Åh This lead to the album being mastered by Jeff Lipton at the noted Peerless Mastering in Boston MA Several tracks showed up on the 2004 surf documentary There AinÅft No Surf In Texas They would also have several tracks used in soundtrack of the 2005 film ÅgDrop Dead Sexy,Åh starring Crispin Glover and Jason Lee
During this period longtime bassist Mykel Foster left the band to focus on growing family responsibilities though the band had a track included on a JourneyÅfs compilation called ÅgGet Out of the Garage.Åh
Southern Backtones
During the time leading up to the 2006 release of their self-titled full length album W Ross Wells began working with them as a sometimes creative developer but primarily as director of the music video for ÅgForeverÅh released in 2007 and ÅgSlumber PartyÅh released in 2009 and key strategist behind their online promotions The results found ÅgForeverÅh included in regular rotation on MTV2 the Canadian network Much Music and was later tapped for use by the CNBC program ÅgAmerican Made.Åh It would go on to win a Gold ADDY for Zenfilm in 2007
The increased attention from the Northeast and Midwest resulted in an extensive national touring schedule as well as radio promotion focusing heavily on responsive areas Josh Applebee joined the tour working with the band as their traveling sound technician In that period Southern Backtones had singles reaching #1 on some stations around Boston and Iowa oddly enough and #2 singles on some stations around the east and west coasts This momentum begun by inclusion on the aforementioned JourneyÅfs compilation led to them again being tapped by LeviÅfs for their Fader Fort SXSW showcase in 2010
A period of varied activity began the band began spending ample time playing with people like Johnny Falstaff John Evans and Craig Kinsey and The Sideshow Tramps SchymaÅfs tornado-chasing exploits received more coverage 2011 marked the year in which Honky Tonk Blood premiered SchymaÅfs first full length film effort made possible by nearly everyone mentioned in this article The film reached local cult-status featuring several iconic businesses and artists around the city A new permanent bass player joined Chris Goodwin and the band proceeded on to producing their next album
La Vie en Nior
2012 saw the release of the Southern Backtones current album La Vie en Noir,regarded as a return to the roots of the initial record fifteen years earlier It was once again recorded at SugarHill Recording Studios with some additional tracking and mixing at Treehouse Studios It was again produced by Dan Workman now co-produced by Steve Christensen this time mastered by Allen Corneau at Essential Sound Mastering Some percussion was recorded by Josh Applebee at his own Chateau de Rosewood it featured a remix of ÅeDirtyÅf originally from the self-titled album by SugarhillÅfs Chris Longwood Schyma and drummer Todd Sommer co-wrote the stringed arrangements played live by Jo Bird of stringed-quartet Two Star Symphony It was released on February 11 2012 with a performance featuring many of the guests stars on the album followed by an anniversary screening of Honky Tonk Blood
Influences
There have been many comparisons to Jim Morrison and The Doors which are in truth early influences There are also David Bowie references dropped especially in regard to the latest album but the band asserts it is due to heavy influence from Pulp instead Early influences also included Elvis Presley Dick Dale Chris Isaac and The Cult critics would add Buzzcocks but the latest album bears more influence from more local artists like John Evans Band Johnny Falstaff Craig Kinsey and the Sideshow Tramps
Other Work
Hank Schyma now spends a portion of each year archiving tornados and other inclement weather footage by a series of trips across central America Some of his work is visible online at his Pecos Hank site and often airs on The Discovery Channel The Weather Channel BBC CNN FOX CBS ABC and CBS He stands on the verge of releasing a feature on his tornado-chasing exploits titled The Monster Show Production on his next full length feature film The Hunchback of Mexico is already under way

When China Met Africa is a 2010 documentary film by Nick Francis and Marc Francis set on the front line of China?s foray into Africa following the lives of a Chinese farmer a road builder and the Zambian trade minister
When China Met Africa was an international co-production involving BBC Storyville Arte France VPRO the Sundance Institute CNC and the Media Fund and produced by Speakit Films and Zeta Productions The film played at international film festivals including Rotterdam Film Festival Munich Goteburg and at the Margaret Mead Film Festival in New York where it won best film It was released in cinemas in the UK in 2011 and was seen on television around the world
When China Met Africa was characterised by The Guardian as An eye-opening documentary that puts into concrete images that truism of the geo-political commentariat that China is a new economic superpower and The Times summarised it as A rare grass-roots view into one of the most important economic developments of the age The film was also covered by media outlets including CNN The Economist and The Atlantic
Storyline
A historic gathering of over 50 African heads of state in Beijing reverberates in Zambia where the lives of three characters unfold Mr Liu is one of thousands of Chinese entrepreneurs who have settled across the continent in search of new opportunities He has just bought his fourth farm and business is booming
In northern Zambia Mr Li a project manager for a multinational Chinese company is upgrading Zambia's longest road Pressure to complete the road on time intensifies when funds from the Zambian government start running out
Meanwhile Zambia's Trade Minister is en route to China to secure millions of dollars of investment
Through the intimate portrayal of these characters the expanding footprint of a rising global power is laid bare - pointing to a radically different future not just for Africa but also for the world
Production
During the production of Black Gold Marc Francis and Nick Francis encountered a group of Chinese workers building a road in southern Ethiopia This meeting sparked questions about China's role as a growing rising superpower
A few years later the crew arrived in Zambia in the midst of Presidential elections where the Zambian opposition leader was campaigning on an anti-Chinese platform Filming became increasingly difficult during this time but over the next few months the film crew had extensive meetings with more than a hundred Chinese people living and working in Zambia including construction managers restaurant owners farmers travel agents labourers CEOÅfs and government officials From these interviews three main characters were chosen to be in the film
One of the main difficulties that was raised during the production was the multitude of dialects spoken by people appearing in the film which made understanding problematic The crew often did not know what their characters were saying until reading the transcripts upon their return to the UK
Distribution and reception
When China Met Africa was theatrically released in the UK in October 2011 after being screened at multiple international festivals The premiere took place at the Prince Charles Cinema in Leicester Square and was followed by a Q&A with the film directors hosted by Channel 4's Jon Snow
It was broadcast on television channels around the world from June 2010 at BBC VPRO YLE TV1 TSR ARTE SVT NRK and Al Jazeera
When China Met Africa was released on DVD internationally in October 2011
The film continues to be screened around the world and has played at major institutions as part of events dealing with Sino-African relations including Columbia University London School of Economics The Smithsonian Institution and The Foreign Policy Association


Abhava

Abhava means non-existence negation nothing or absence It is the negative of Bhava which means being becoming existing or appearance Uddayana divides Pad?rtha Categories into Bhava existence which is real and Abhava non-existence which is not real Dravya substance Gu?a quality Karma action Samanya community or generality Visesa particularity or partimerity and Samavaya inherence are the marks of existence Abhava has not been categorically defined by the Vaisheshika School of Hindu philosophy but is of four kinds viz ? 1 Pragabhava i.e Prior non-existence 2 Pradhvamsabhava i.e Posterior non-existence 3 Atyantabhava i.e Absolute non-existence and 4 Anyonyabhava i.e Mutual non-existence
The process with which the sound value collapses into the point value of the gap existing between the first and the next syllable of the first letter of the Rigveda Agnim is Pradhvamsabhava the silent point of all possibilities within the gap is Atyantabhava the structuring dynamics of what happens within the gap Anyonyabhava and the mechanics by which the sound emerges from the point value of the gap i.e emergence of the following syllable is Pragabhava this mechanism is inherent in both syllables
The Vaisheshika the Nyaya the Bhatta Mimamsa and Dvaita schools hold Abhava as a distinct category Recognised as a reality by the Nyaya school Abhava is often stated to be the reality of the greatest moment in the pluralistic universe and is connected with Mukti It is a relative word for there can be abhava only when previously there is bhava moreover it is an event occurring in time The Nyaya and the Siddhantin maintain that the cognition of abhava is due to perception involving special kind of contact or sense contact
Abhava is that unmanifest level from where the concrete Bhava arises or emerges Vasubandhu has referred to Sunyata having the characteristic of the own-being of abhava rather than a characteristic consisting of bhava which Sthiramati observes is in fact not redundant which means abhava does not negate bhava Abhava refers to particular entities and not to Being it is a theoretical or logical denial of the existence of some particular impossibility
The acceptance of abhava as an independent padartha having ontological reality of its own is a peculiar feature of Indian philosophical tradition Dharmakirti considered abhava as an anumana He had brought in the idea of imaginary presence of that whose absence was apprehended in order to explain the specificity of the absence


RV Clifford A Barnes

The RV Clifford A Barnes is a research vessel owned by the National Science Foundation and operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System fleet The University of Washington School of Oceanography currently operates the vessel under a Charter Party agreement Other ships in use by the University of Washington include the RV Thomas G Thompson T-AGOR-23 and the Wealander
History
The Clifford A Barnes began service as a United States Coast Guard tugboat designated USCG BITT WYTL 65613 Built by Western Boat in 1965 for ice operations search and rescue and pollution response she was one of fifteen of her class ordered by the Coast Guard She was decommissioned in 1982 and turned over to the National Science Foundation although ships of her class remained in use by the USCG until 1995
Current mission
The University of Washington School of Oceanography uses the Barnes for oceanographic and fishery research in the protected littoral waters of Washington and British Columbia The vessel serves as platform for research on the fjord system of Puget Sound and the surrounding bodies of water She supports research best done in sheltered bodies of water and on the effects of populated areas on coastal areas The Barnes has a small science space two winches a crane and can house up to six scientists and students Cruises are generally only one day in length although they sometimes run as long as six days The university's use of the Barnes is supported through a combination of grants and contracts the university's operating funds and self-sustaining revenue The Barnes has gone on over 77 cruises since April 2008
Community outreach
An important non-research function of the Clifford A Barnes is to serve as a vehicle for community outreach The main purpose of this outreach is to educate students about the marine sciences This is primarily done through a two-day open house for local students grades three to twelve Faculty crew and students give tours of the ship as well as demonstrations of marine research
Replacement
Although an October 2011 National Science Foundation inspection revealed that the Barnes is still in generally good condition its limited scientific and berthing capacity have prompted the University of Washington to look for a replacement Although the replacement ship would still operate primarily in and around Puget Sound Jensen Maritime Consultants has been commissioned to draw up plans for the a vessel that will feature faster cruising speed expended range and increased berthing among other improvements However the National Science Foundation has recommended that the RV Clifford A Barnes stay in service through 2016

South African law of sale

The South African law of sale is an area of the legal system in that country that describes rules applicable to a contract of sale or to be more specific purchase and sale or emptio venditio generally described as a contract whereby one person agrees to deliver to another the free possession of a thing in return for a price in money
Definition and essentials of the contract
Definition
The contract of sale as it is known in South Africa today derives its origins from the Roman consensual contract of emptio venditio In D 18.1 the title devoted to the contract of emptio venditio there is no all-embracing definition of the special contract but certain critical features can be extracted from the early fragments of the title
Sale is a contract of the law of nations and so is concluded by simple agreement There is no sale without a price There can be no sale without a thing to be sold
The Roman-Dutch lawyers followed these guidelines closely in their definitions of the contract of sale For example Voet said
Purchase defined?But in this title as distinguished from lease it is a bonae fidei contract resting on consent by which it is arranged that merchandise shall be exchanged at a definite price There are three essential requirements for it?consent merchandise and price If one of them is wanting there is no purchase
In South African law today the definition of a contract of sale remains virtually the same In Treasurer-General v Lippert the full board of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council cited with approval the following statement by De Villiers CJ
A sale is a contract in which one person the seller or vendor promises to deliver a thing to another the buyer or emptor the latter agreeing to pay a certain price
According to Mackeurtan
Purchase and sale emptio venditio is a mutual contract for the transfer of possession of a thing in exchange for a price It has three essentials consent consensus ad idem a thing sold merx and a price pretium
Remember that a sale contract is a special form of contract and so all law discussed under the article on the South African law of contract is relevant in considering sale contracts
Essentials
In general terms the essential elements of a contract of sale are no different from the essential elements of any other contract There must be contractual capacity and consensus the agreement must be legal not contrary to public policy performance must be possible and any formalities required by law must be complied with The contract of sale does however have a number of additional substantive requirements known as essentialia which are assimilated into the general contractual structure Of course like any contract the requirement of consensus or agreement is the most important general element
Agreement
The parties must be in agreement that the object of the contract is to purchase and to sell the res concerned for the price agreed upon and that the seller usually ensures the transfer of possession and/or ownership of the res to the buyer
The general principles relating to consensus in purchase and sale are the same as those pertaining to other multilateral consensual contracts The relevant points may be summarised as follows
In sales in particular there must be agreement as to
The two essentialia of a contract of sale are therefore
Thing sold
The parties to the sale must reach agreement over the subject matter of the sale The general requirement is that the subject matter of the sale should be
It is best to tackle the intricacies of this particular section by first examining things that can be sold and secondly things that cannot validly be sold
Things that can be sold
Generally speaking anything can be sold be it corporeal or incorporeal in nature Physical existence is not required for there to be a valid sale Anything that can be held possessed or sued for can be the subject of a valid sale There are however certain more specialised issues that need to be discussed for the full picture to emerge
The question in respect of a sale of res sua is whether or not a person can enter into a valid contract of sale involving the purchase of a thing that is unbeknownst to him his own property already The general rule is that things owned by the buyer cannot be the subject of a valid sale It is possible however for the purchaser to buy rights in his own property that he does not yet hold
Unascertained goods may form the subject matter of a valid contract of sale Such sales may be termed generic sales or emptio generis Future goods or goods that do not yet exist may also be the subject of a valid sale Such a sale may take one of two forms
A sale can come into being if it involves something that does not yet in exist provided that the thing may in the ordinary course of events come into existence Pothier says the following
There cannot in truth be a contract of sale without a thing sold but it is sufficient that the thing sold may exist though it has no present existence Thus it is common before harvest to sell the wine which we may make and in such case there is a sufficient thing to constitute the object of a valid contract though as the thing sold does not yet exist the contract depends upon the condition of its future existence and if it should not yet happen to exist that is if no wine should be made there is no sale
These sort of contracts are known as emptio rei speratae A classic example would be that where Boucher agrees to purchase Smith's next crop of maize at R40 per bag Because the sale involves maize it appears at first glance to be a generic sale but it is distinguishable on at least two grounds
It is possible to purchase the expectation or hope that something might come into existence irrespective of whether it does or does not come into existence in future The jurisprudent Pomponius is quoted as saying
Sometimes indeed there is held to be a sale even without a thing as where what is bought is as it were a chance This is the case with the purchase of a catch of birds or fish The contract is valid even if nothing results because it is the purchase of a hope
Such a contract is a contract emptio spei For example Boucher agrees to purchase Smith's next catch of fish for R200 What is sold in this case is the hope or expectation of a catch not the catch itself The spes exists at the date of sale It makes no difference to the obligations of the parties whether Smith catches anything at all Thus Boucher runs the risk of making a loss in that he must pay even if nothing comes into existence but may benefit in that he may receive greater value than his capital outlay
Res aliena things that are not the property of the seller may also be the subject of a valid sale It is not essential that the seller be the owner of the goods at the time of delivery The sale is not void simply because the seller is not the owner of the res vendita and has sold it without the owner's authority What is essential is that the seller delivers the property to the buyer and ensures that his possession is not thereafter interfered with by anyone with better title The buyer in such circumstances is protected at the very least by the residual warranty against eviction
Delivery of the res in such circumstances would result in transfer from the seller to the buyer of whatever rights the seller had The buyer would acquire civil possession of the res the consequences of which would be inter alia
Things that are the subject of litigation in rem res litigiosa may be the subject of a valid contract of sale as well Such a sale might occur where property which is the subject of pending court action is sold in the interim Should such property be sold the purchaser is bound by the judgment in the action The successful plaintiff is entitled to recover it from the purchaser the new possessor by execution without further proceedings
Where property is the subject of an action in rem it becomes res litigiosa at litis contestatio
Things that cannot be sold
Various things cannot be sold under South African law Res extra commercium are among them Numerous rules of statutory and common law prohibit the sale of certain things often on grounds of public policy For example the common law does not sanction the sale of a person slavery and statute prohibits the sale of human tissue and of many narcotics chemical substances and so forth
It is also quite clearly impossible to purchase a thing that never existed The most extreme example would be the putative sale of a mythical or fictitious object Justinian says
Anything whether movable or immovable which admits of private ownership may be made the object of a stipulation but if a man stipulates for the delivery of a thing that either does not or cannot exist such as an impossible creature like a hippocentaur the contract is void
Where the subject of a proposed contract of sale is a specific thing and it has prior to the agreement and unbeknownst to the parties ceased to exist the agreement is ordinarily void In Theron Ltd in Liquidation v Gross Watermeyer J said
Undoubtedly it is a principle of our law that a contract for the sale of a specific thing made in ignorance of the fact that the things had been destroyed at the time of the contract is not binding upon the parties
For a good factual example see Scrutton and Scrutton v Erlich & Co and Others
It is impossible for res litigiosa to be sold to the seller's advocate or attorney This is known as champerty Mackeurtan states
There can be no valid sale at any stage of the proceedings of property the subject of such an action to the advocate or attorney of the seller Such agreements are known as pacta de quota litis and are void
The sale by Wells to Samuels of an inheritance expected from Hutton while Hutton is still alive is stigmatised by being unenforceable although it is not void ab initio Once Hutton has died however an inheritance may be sold
Sales by description and sample
Some sales occur either by description or by sample
Price
In Westinghouse Brake and Equipment Pty Ltd v Bilger Engineering Pty Ltd Corbett JA said the following
It is a general rule of our law that there can be no valid contract of sale unless the parties have agreed expressly or by implication upon a purchase price
Mackeurtan identifies the following essentials in connection with price It must be
Serious
Being serious in amount implies that any price that is real not illusory suffices If the price set is merely nominal in amount this may be a strong indication that the parties intend a donation not a sale The question can be settled only on the circumstances of each individual case In other words the price should be real and bear some sort of relationship to the actual value of the thing and the seller must intend actually exacting the price Ulpian says
If a person sells for a small price meaning to make a gift the sale is valid for it is only when donation is the sole consideration moving the sale that we hold it absolutely void but when a thing is sold at a reduced price as a mode of donation there is no doubt that the sale is good
The parties are not prevented by this requirement from driving a hard bargain and obtaining the thing for a very low price or selling it for a very high price given the intention to buy or sell for that price It follows then that the price need not necessarily be fair or equivalent to the value of the thing but that it should be a real price the seller must intend to exact and the buyer intend to pay Zulman and Kairinos say
The policy of the law is to allow everyone in the absence of fraud to make the best bargain he can and both vendor and the purchaser are entitled by the exercise of superior shrewdness to circumvent each other as long as such circumvention does not amount to fraud
Although it is a question of fact a price is often not held to be real or serious if it bears absolutely no relation to the value of the thing sold This is the situation for example where the price is truly nominal or illusory?as in circumstances where the seller has no intention whatsoever of exacting the so-called price Some parties may also dress up a contract as a sale when in fact it is designed to be some other form of contract entirely
Certain fixed or readily ascertainable
Ordinarily speaking the price to be paid for the merx must be fixed by the parties This is not an absolute rule The general principle is id certum est quod certum reddi potest That which can readily be made certain is certain It is therefore not necessary that the price actually have been fixed to fulfil this requirement it is sufficient if the parties have agreed upon a method by which the price can be fixed In Burroughs Machines Ltd v Chenille Corporation of SA Pty Ltd Colman J said
It is I think clear that there can be no valid contract of sale unless the parties have agreed expressly or by implication upon a purchase price They must either fix the amount of that price in their contract or agree upon some external standard by the application whereof it will be possible to determine the price without further reference to them
If the parties take the latter route the important thing is that it must be possible to ascertain the price by the method agreed upon This can be done in several ways
Current money
The price must consist in valid currency It need not be expressed in South Africa currency if it is not however then in some convertible foreign currency
Where the consideration is completely in goods rather than in money the contract is one of exchange not a sale If it consists partly in money and partly in goods the contract may be a sale or an exchange depending upon the intention of the parties Generally though the contract is a sale
This section considers legal consequences of the contract of sale along with those of conditional sales which modify the usual consequences Certain relevant contractual terms are also briefly be discussed
Legal effects of the contract
Passing of ownership
It is not a requirement of a valid contract of sale that ownership should pass from seller to buyer Although parties to a sale usually contemplate this happening it is not an essential feature of a contract of sale and as we have seen sales by non-owners are permissible At common law the transfer of a real right of ownership the performance of the contract is regarded as a separate legal transaction from the contract itself which creates only personal obligations
Because ownership does pass as a result of most contracts of sale however the issue of ownership is an important incidence of a sale
Usually to transfer ownership in a res it is not only necessary that it be physically delivered by the owner it is necessary also that the owner have the intention of transferring the right of ownership to the buyer and that the buyer have the intention of becoming the owner of the thing in question
As far as sales are concerned there are certain additional refinements
Immovable property
In the case of immovables ownership passes upon registration of transfer in the Deeds Registry The position is regulated by the Deeds Registries Act In other words registration constitutes delivery in the case of immovables and ownership passes whether the price has been paid or not
Incorporeals
Ownership in incorporeals is transferred by means of cession
Movable property
Ownership in movable property is transferred
Delivery
Delivery usually occurs by means of traditio Ownership passes on traditio only if the following essentials are present
Forms of delivery
Delivery may occur in two ways
Actual delivery
Actual delivery traditio vera occurs where the res vendita is physically handed over by one person to another de manu in manum
Constructive delivery
Constructive delivery concerns those various methods of transferring ownership by which no physical handing over of the res vendita takes place There are five methods of constructive delivery
Payment
Ownership passes on delivery only if cash is paid or if credit has been allowed In Laing v SA Milling Co Ltd Juta JA said On a sale of movables followed by delivery the property does not pass until the purchaser has paid the money or secured the seller for the same or unless the sale is on credit
At this juncture it is important to distinguish between how ownership passes in cash and credit sales respectively In a cash sale ownership passes once there has been in addition to delivery due payment of the purchase price In a sale on credit the fact that credit has been given is an indication that ownership merely passed on delivery In an ordinary credit sale the seller cannot claim that he did not intend ownership to pass until the full price had been paid This does not cover the situation where the sale is one subject to a pactum reservati dominii
In the absence of agreement express or implied that credit has been granted it is presumed that every sale is a cash sale The point is well illustrated in Daniels v Cooper
The presumption of a cash sale may therefore be rebutted by adducing evidence of an agreement to give credit If the rebuttal succeeds ownership passes on delivery If credit has not been granted ownership does not pass until the price is paid?even if delivery has in the meantime taken place An agreement to give credit must be clear and specific
That being said it is now much more difficult to show an agreement on credit than under the common law This is so because of legislation If the sale happens to be one on credit the requirements of the National Credit Act apply to it
Where a sale is for cash and the seller accepts a cheque for payment of the cash price ownership does not pass notwithstanding the delivery of the res vendita unless the cheque is met when presented for payment
Risk and benefit
Common law
In most ordinary day-to-day commercial transactions the conclusion of a contract of sale and the passing of ownership by delivery of the res occurs instantaneously In some types of sale however there is a delay between the time of entry into the contract of sale and the time of transfer of possession and ownership The question that must be answered in these circumstances is this Who gains the advantage of any benefits accruing to the res and who bears the risk of damage occurring to it during this window period
Risk
Mackeurtan defines risk as follows
By risk is meant the loss resulting from damage to or destruction of the thing sold or any other disadvantage accruing to or affecting it arising through any agency other than the breach of contract or wrongful act or default of the seller
Losses that fall within the rule include those due to vis maior casus fortuitus general deterioration over time and even theft Voet says
Under the name of risk falls here every disadvantage which overtakes a thing sold such as death running away and wounding in the case of an animal sold an opening of the ground in the case of a field conflagration and collapse in the case of a house shipwreck in the case of a ship mustiness souring or leakage in the case of wine and finally spoiling going bad perishing or purloining in the case of all things
For a modern example see Van der Merwe v Viljoen
Not falling within the rule are losses caused by the failure of the seller to observe the appropriate standard of care
Where the risk lies
South Africa follows the Roman-law rule with regard to risk In the absence of negligence on the part of the seller the general rule is that the risk passes to the buyer when the sale is perfecta that is as soon as the agreement of sale is concluded and before delivery or payment of the price
The natural consequence of this rule is that the full price must be paid by the buyer even though the thing sold is damaged or destroyed before it is handed over
This general rule applies however where
The parties may vary the normal rules regarding risk by express agreement in their contract Courts are loath to accept that such an agreement to vary was implied from the parties negotiations although it is possible for this to occur One salient question here is whether or not an undertaking by the seller to deliver the goods at a specified destination necessarily implies agreement to vary the incidence of the risk The answer would appear to be no Why should a mere agreement to deliver at a distance imply a term that risk is to remain with the seller until delivery The situation would be quite different where the seller undertakes to deliver the thing safely to the agreed destination
The general rule also applies where specific goods must be weighed measured or counted In this regard a distinction must be drawn between sales ad quantitatem and sales per aversionem Where the sale is ad quantitatem there is a sale of specific goods but the price depends on the counting weighing or measuring for example R300 per sheep for the flock The risk does not pass in this case until the price has been ascertained by counting the flock
Pothier explains the situation in the following way
If the sale is of things which consist in quantitate and which are sold by weight number or measure as if one sells ten casks of corn ten thousand pounds of sugar or one hundred carp the sale is not perfect until the corn is measured the sugar weighed or the carp counted For this reason until the thing is measured weighed or counted it does not become at the risk of the buyer for the risk cannot fall upon some indeterminate thing
Where the sale is per aversionem it is as it were in the gross The price is a lump sum for the ascertained goods even if the res vendita is of a type normally weighed measured or counted for example a flock of sheep at R10,000 for the lot Pothier says
But if the goods are not sold by weight or measure but per aversionem that is in bulk and for a single and only price in such case the sale is perfect from the instant of the contract and from that time these goods are at the risk of the buyer
While the situation envisaged in respect of unascertained goods is analogous to that above the price is usually ascertained but the res vendita is not The subject matter has not yet been appropriated to the contract for example 100 bags of maize at R55 per bag from a warehouse containing 10,000 bags Risk in the res vendita does not pass until goods answering the description in the contract have been appropriated to the contract For appropriation to occur there must be some overt act by the seller such as a setting aside or marking of the relevant goods
The general rule also applies obviously where there is a statutory provision to the contrary
The ordinary rules of risk are altered where a party is in default of his obligations under the contract The rule varies by
The rule here is that the presence of one of these factors relieves the injured party of the incidence of risk save in so far as any damage of the thing may be due to his own misconduct or gross negligence
Benefit
Kerr defines benefit as any natural or civil fruits and other similar advantages gains or profits The general rule is that the benefit in the res vendita follows the risk Any benefits pass to the buyer once the sale is perfecta This does not however include fortuitous gains The benefit must be directly connected with and actually produced by the property that has been sold If the profits were purely accidental and would not have been in the contemplation of the parties at the time of concluding the sale the buyer cannot claim such a benefit
Consumer Protection Act
This area of the law faces significant changes under the Consumer Protection Act
Conditional sales
As already indicated the ordinary rules of the common law regarding the passing of ownership and risk or benefit may be modified if the parties agree to certain conditions
Conditions
The contracting parties writes Mackeurtan may include in their agreement any provisions that they wish subject to the limitations hereinafter laid down These may suspend the operation or cause the dissolution of the contract until or upon the happening of an uncertain future event The first class are suspensive and the second resolutive
Whether a condition is suspensive or resolutive is a matter of construction The courts look beyond the ipse dixit of the parties and interpret the words as they stand The following prerequisites must exist for a condition to be operative
Terms
As noted above conditions proper affect the operation or bring about the dissolution of the contract On the other hand terms only modify the ordinary effect of the contract For example the parties might agree to a term that the ordinary rule of risk is varied
Suspensive conditions
The legal effect of suspensive conditions in the law of sale is a matter of some controversy but effectively the position is this Unlike other contracts a contract subject to a suspensive condition only becomes a contract of sale once the condition is fulfilled Since this is contrary to the common-law position and indeed to logic the significant types of contracts with the character of a sale and subject to suspensive conditions have been covered by legislative amendments so that the anomaly does not apply Most of its significant effects in practice have been ameliorated by legislation
Resolutive conditions
A valid resolutive condition has the following effect
Examples
The following are examples of commonly-encountered conditional sales
Approval of financial stability or availability of loan
A suspensive condition is sometimes found in commercial transactions to the effect that the transaction depends upon the seller's approval of the buyer's financial stability There is no contract of sale until the seller gives his approval He must exercise his discretion reasonably and in good faith
A similar clause is found in a deed of sale where the sale of land is subject to the conditions that the buyer is able to
If it becomes clear the conditions cannot be satisfied the contract falls through
Sale or return
Sale or return pactum displicentiae is a type of conditional sale often encountered in practice It involves the buyer receiving goods from the seller with the option of becoming the owner He can exercise his option in several ways
This type of contract could be considered as subject to a condition that suspends the sale until the buyer has done one of the above-mentioned things to indicate his intention to become the buyer Mackeurtan however feels that contracts of sale or return are examples of contracts subject to a resolutive condition
Sales on approval
There is some disagreement about approval sales Some argue that these are sales subject to a suspensive condition Since the sale is subject to the examination and approval of the buyer the operation of the sale is suspended until the buyer's approval has been expressed
There is another view that these are sales subject to a resolutive condition On this view the sale transaction is carried out completely and the client is charged If however the client feels that the merchandise is no good he is entitled to return the item to the seller and the transaction is reversed In modern-day consumer contracts this seems to be the better view
Residual obligations of the seller and remedies of the buyer
Seller required to take care of res vendita until merx is made available
The discussion of risk above indicates that the risk of accidental loss normally passes to the buyer as soon as the contract of sale is perfecta This however does not release the seller from all responsibility for the thing sold while it remains in his possession The general rule is that the seller is under an obligation to take care of the thing until the time comes for performance and that he is responsible for any damage caused by his fraud or negligence In Frumer v Maitland Schreiner JA said
It will be convenient to consider first the obligations of a vendor who has not yet delivered the property sold It is his duty to look after it as would a bonus paterfamilias and if he fails in that duty the purchaser would be entitled to claim damages or if but only if the result of the vendor's neglect is that the thing sold is materially different from the thing tendered to repudiate the contract and to refuse to take delivery
Where it is the seller who is in mora the seller becomes liable for all loss no matter how it comes about Only if it can be shown that the damage would nonetheless have occurred even if the thing had been delivered will the loss be the buyer's
The extent of the duty to take care pending delivery is altered if the buyer is in mora in taking delivery If the buyer has failed to take delivery the seller is only liable for the consequences of his gross negligence culpa lata or fraud dolus He is not liable for ordinary negligence
The measure of care may also be varied by agreement
Where the res vendita has been damaged or lost while in possession of the seller prior to delivery and the responsibility is not the seller's he must cede to the buyer any rights of action he might have in respect of the damage so that the buyer might exercise these rights in covering his own loss If for example the goods are stolen and found in possession of a third party not the thief the seller must cede his vindicatory rights to the buyer
The buyer's remedies
Where the seller has not taken due care the remedies available depend on whether the goods are specific or unascertained
Specific goods
In the case of specific goods where the damage is material the buyer is entitled to refuse to accept delivery of the goods and to repudiate the contract claim damages and a refund of the price if paid In other words he is entitled to treat the situation as he would non-delivery of the thing Where the damage is not material the buyer must accept the delivery of the goods and then claim damages
Unascertained goods
Where the sale is of unascertained goods the buyer may reject the goods and once again treat the seller as if there had been no delivery at all whether the breach is major or not provided the damage is not trifling Where however the purchaser accepts the res vendita but claims damages the damages are estimated on the basis of the difference between the value of the sound goods and the value of the damaged goods delivered The buyer may also claim any wasted necessary expenditure
Seller's duty to make available the thing sold
This duty is the same as the duty to deliver the res vendita as it is most often described?including in the new Consumer Protection Act Some prefer Kerr's description One should understand the terms making the thing sold available and delivery as being synonymous
Mackeurtan deals with this matter in great detail enumerating the six elements of this duty with semantic variations as follows
Agreed time and place
The seller must make the thing available at the time and place stipulated in the contract
Time
If no time is stipulated the res vendita must be made available immediately if performance is possible at the time of sale or within a reasonable time if the process must necessarily take time The circumstance of each contract determines what is a reasonable time A seller who fails to make the thing sold available at the appropriate time is in mora
The seller is not entitled to deliver by instalments if the contract was not to that effect Where periods are stated for delivery by instalments though the seller is bound to deliver as agreed upon
Place
The seller must make the thing sold available at the place agreed upon in the contract If no place is agreed upon he must make it available at the place where the article is if it is specific If the res is unascertained the seller must make it available at his place of business if he has no place of business then at his residence If the thing is ordered to be manufactured the thing must be made available at the place of manufacture in the absence of any agreement to the contrary
Same condition as at time of sale
In Frumer v Maitland Schreiner JA noted that The appellant was entitled to delivery of the house in a state not materially different from that in which it was at the date of the contract
In accordance with specifications
The rules regarding this element are protean The following discussion considers only two facets
First it should be pointed out that where sales are concluded by sample such a contract contains an express warranty that the bulk of the goods conform to the sample If the final consignment does not comply the warranty is breached and the buyer has an actio empti and a full range of contractual remedies including where appropriate a claim for damages
Secondly as Volpe puts it The seller may not make available more or less than the amount stated in the contract nor the contract goods mixed with others of a different description
In Cedarmount Store v Webster & Co Wessels JP held
According to our law a contract to deliver at one and the same time a number of articles of a particular quality is prima facie an entire contract and the seller has no right to alter the nature of the contract ASi in emptione modus dictus est et non-praestatur ex emptio actus est It is based upon the principle that a creditor cannot be compelled to accept a partial payment or a part performance of a contract Although the subject matter of the contract is physically capable of division yet from the legal point of view the obligation is a payment of the entire sum due or a number to be delivered There is no duty cast upon a purchaser to separate the bad part of a consignment from that of the good As soon as he satisfies himself that out of a large number of bags there is an unreasonable number defective he is prima facie entitled to reject the lot
There is some dispute about the powers of a purchaser with regard to violations of this requirement
With all accessories appurtenances and fruits
Mackeurtan defines these words as follows
Vacua possessio
This obligation means first that the seller must make the thing available in such a manner that no-one is alleging any immediate right of possession over the res In other words at the time the thing is made available the buyer must acquire free and undisturbed possession
Secondly it means that the seller must make available the thing sold in such a way that no-one in future can establish a superior legal right to the thing against the buyer This particular part of the seller's obligation involves the warranty against eviction
Whatever is necessary to make the thing sold available
This obligation may be subdivided into a number of duties
Where the res vendita comprises unascertained goods the seller must appropriate them to the contract and ensure that the quantity and description and quality of the goods thus appropriated are in accordance with the terms of the contract
If anything has to be done to the res vendita to put it in a deliverable state the seller is responsible for doing so at his own expense
The seller must if the buyer requires this give the latter reasonable opportunity to examine the thing prior to acceptance
The seller must give notice to the buyer of the fact that the thing is available if the buyer cannot reasonably be expected to appropriate the thing without such notice
Buyer's remedies
Mackeurtan writes
The seller of goods may be in default as regards his duty to deliver either by not delivering at all or by delivering goods other than or more or less than those bought or because he has tendered the goods at an improper time or place He may have repudiated his obligations He may have broken his warranty against eviction or his obligation to take care of the goods until delivery These are clearly breaches of contract for which the buyer's remedies are contractual
The nature of remedies for breach of this residual duty are particularly detailed and complex A brief summary is given here based on Kerr's discussion
Specific performance
The buyer has a right to demand the thing sold to him subject of course to the court's discretion to refuse it The remedy is available to a buyer who rejects the tender of goods as being inappropriate As we have seen a buyer having received less than what he contracted to receive may prefer to accept what was tendered but sue for the balance to be produced
Cancellation
Failure to make the goods available in a contract of sale is a major breach It entitles the buyer to cancel the contract In Landau v City Auction Mart Watermeyer JA said
I can find nothing in Roman-Dutch law which stands in the way of an order being made in favour of a purchaser for cancellation of a contract of sale and repayment of the price by reason of a refusal by the defendant to deliver the property sold
Damages
If the seller fails to make the goods available damages may be awarded with or without cancellation depending on the circumstances and type of breach according to the general principles of contract
Seller's duty to transfer ownership
The seller has a duty to transfer ownership if he has it or can obtain it failing which his duty is to warrant the buyer against eviction
Transfer of ownership
The seller as noted before need not be the owner of the thing he is selling In most circumstances he is though and is therefore obliged to transfer ownership This duty although seeming to amount to common sense has been a source of some debate in South African law In particular uncertainty has been caused by statements made by Wessels JA in the case of Kleynhans Brothers v Wessels Trustee This debate is considered in due course
Should a seller mala fide fail to transfer ownership the buyer has an action ex empto for transfer of ownership as soon as he discovers the true position
Warranty against eviction
Again the seller is normally the owner of the property He is expected to transfer this ownership as part of the sale What happens however in the situation where someone bona fide believes he is the owner of the thing he is selling but in fact is not Such sales are of course valid but ever since Roman days the law has said that a person who buys and takes possession of property from such a seller has no action unless and until he is threatened with eviction by someone with better legal title to the property usually the true owner The action arises in such circumstances out of what is known as the warranty against eviction The warranty requires of the seller that he do whatever is legally possible to protect the buyer in his possession of the res vendita An inability to do so renders him liable under this warranty The warranty is obliquely re-articulated in the Consumer Protection Act
Three basic requirements must be met before the seller becomes liable on the buyer's eviction
Eviction
Voet states Eviction is the recovery by judicial process of our property which the opponent has acquired by iustus titulus It should be noted however that in present times the word has a much wider connotation than that given in Voet's definition It means any lawful interference with vacua possessio by seller or third party In Norman's Purchase and Sale it is said that eviction
thus includes a demand on the part of a third person to hand over the property sold to him if the purchaser is unable to resist such a claim the refusal of the person in possession of the property to relinquish it to the purchaser the demand for payment of a sum of money by the purchaser in order to retain the whole or portion of the res vendita and conceivably the existence of a concealed servitude over the property which interferes with the use and possession of the property In short anything which weakens the purchaser's right to the whole or a portion of the thing sold or which constitutes a menace to his right of having free and undisturbed possession
The seller is not liable for any unlawful interference with the buyer's possession Liability only arises if the interference is the result of a flaw in the seller's title The flaw must have existed at the time of sale or if it arose subsequently to the sale be due to the seller's own act Eviction therefore does not include situations where the sale is set aside by the court or if the property is attached by the seller's creditors before ownership passed
The warranty begins to operate as soon as the buyer's vacua possessio is threatened
The idea of eviction writes Volpe has also been extended to cater for successive sales the repayment of the purchase price to the purchaser who has been evicted is equated in that situation with the seller's own eviction and serves as such when the seller looks next to the one from whom he himself bought
Thus Kerr writes The facts of Olivier v Van der Bergh and Louis Botha Motors v James Slabbert Motors show that it is not uncommon for A to sell to B and B to C possession being transferred in both cases before the true owner makes his claim These decisions show that once a claim has been made against C and he has surrendered the thing sold whether after judgment or because he can show that the claimant has an unassailable right he may claim compensation from B and B may claim from A C may not in the absence of cession claim direct from A
In cases where there has been a string of successive sales however intermediate parties who have bought and then sold goods on to other parties do have the locus standi to bring proceedings to determine whether the person claiming a right to the property has a legitimate right to do so
The action on the warranty also arises where the res vendita or part of it is in the possession of a third party and the buyer is unable to obtain it
Notice
As soon as eviction is threatened the buyer is required to give the seller notice of the third party's claim to possession of the thing The seller has to be given adequate notice to fulfil his obligation to protect the buyer's possession The duties of the seller are somewhat unclear but it seems that he is expected to intervene in the action and take up the defence against the other party claiming title It is the seller's duty under the warranty to relieve the buyer of the risks and costs of court action If the buyer fails to give the necessary notice he has no recourse against the seller unless he can prove that the third party's right is incontestable or that it is the seller's fault that the notice did not reach him in time
The buyer is relieved of this duty when
Determined defence
The buyer faced with eviction is required in most circumstances to put up a determined defence virilis defensio of his possession unless he can prove that the claimant's title was legally unassailable This must be done when the seller has failed to assist the buyer either because he cannot be found or because he refused to assist
The buyer's remedies
Kerr states that a buyer claiming under the warranty is entitled to repayment of the purchase price or whatever portion has been paid and if loss over and above the amount can be shown compensation for such loss The action is a contractual one which is sued for by means of the actio empti
Being a bona fide possessor the buyer could also claim for any improvements made to the property this from the true owner
Where eviction is partial only and insufficient to entitle the buyer to claim rescission he is entitled to claim the difference between the value of the property at eviction and the value of what is left to him
It is important to remember that the warranty is residual One may contract out of it if this is possible
Duty to make res vendita available free from defects
The seller is required to make the thing sold available without defects or diseases
Where the seller makes the res available with a defect a number of considerations determine the nature and extent of the remedy available to the buyer In any defect case one needs to consider two critical things
In certain circumstances the buyer's remedy is clearly contractual enforceable in terms of the actio empti In other circumstances the remedies are not contractual they find their roots in the aedilitian actions of Roman law The extent of relief available differs depending upon which remedy applies Historically contractual actions entitle the buyer to consequential damages while the aedilitian remedies do not While some decisions do not specify which remedy is referred to the differences in the nature of the remedies remain important
Patent defects
Patent defects are defects obvious to the naked eye easily discoverable by the buyer at the time the goods are received An example would be a scab on a sheep Where specific goods are identified or unascertained goods are appropriated by the seller to the contract and the goods suffer from a patent defect the seller may be sued for breach of contract by defective performance The remedies are therefore contractual consequential damages may be claimed
Where the buyer has inspected the res vendita at or before the time of sale and the inspection ought to have disclosed a defect and the buyer accepts the goods without objection the seller is not liable provided he has not warranted expressly or impliedly the absence of the defect nor fraudulently concealed it The reasoning behind this rule is that the buyer has waived his remedies by his conduct He is deemed to have bought the goods subject to the defect which he ought to have discovered
Latent defects
In Holmdene Brickworks Pty Ltd v Roberts Construction Co Ltd Corbett JA defined a latent defect as follows
Broadly speaking in this context a latent defect may be described as an abnormal quality or attribute which destroys or substantially impairs the utility or effectiveness of the res vendita for the purpose for which it was sold or for which it is commonly used Such a defect is latent when it is one which is not visible or discoverable upon an inspection of the res vendita
In other words a latent defect would not be apparent to an ordinary person even if an expert might have discovered it Where the seller makes the thing sold available and it is discovered that the thing has a latent defect the seller is liable to the buyer in four circumstances It is important to note that the first three categories allow an aggrieved party a contractual remedy that is an actio empti which includes a claim for consequential loss or id quod interesse The fourth category provides for aedilitian relief
The four categories are
Fraud
Regarding mala fides on the part of the seller Glaston House Pty Ltd v Inag Pty Ltd
Warranty
Where the seller has given an express or implied warranty against the existence of the defect or has warranted the fitness of the res vendita for the purpose for which it is bought the seller is liable The action is contractual The case provides a useful distinction between contractual and aedilitian remedies for latent defects
Skill and expert knowledge
The leading cases are Kroonstad Westelike Boere Ko-operatiewe Vereeninging v Botha and Another Holmdene Brickworks Sentrachem Bpk v Weinhold Langeberg Voedsel Bpk v Sarculum Boerdery Bpk Sentrachem Ltd v Prinsloo Ciba-Geigy Pty Ltd v Lushof Farms Pty Ltd and D&H Piping Systems Pty Ltd v Trans Hex Group Ltd See also section 61 of the Consumer Protection Act
Aedilitian actions
A seller is also liable for latent defects in the merx in terms of the aedilitian actions The curule aediles were the Roman magistrates in charge of markets and public works They had the power to issue edicts Their most famous edict concerned a seller's liability for latent defects Ulpian said
Labeo writes that the edict of the curule aediles applies as well to sales of land as to sales of chattels inanimate or animate The aediles say Sellers of slaves are to inform buyers of any disease morbus or defect vitium in any slave and whether any slave is a runaway a vagabond or not free from noxal liability all these matters they must declare with proper publicity when the slave shall be sold But if a slave was sold in contravention of the foregoing or in contravention of what was stated or promised when he was being sold we grant to the buyer an action for redhibition of the slave The motive for the proposition of this edict is to defeat the artifices of sellers and to assist buyers whenever they are cheated by sellers It is however to be understood that a seller even though he was unaware of the existence of faults must nevertheless be held liable Nor is this unfair for the seller was in a position to inform himself on these matters while to the buyer it makes no difference as to whether his deception is due to the seller's ignorance or guile
The seller's obligations and the buyer's rights in terms of the aedilitian actions arise ex lege by operation of law not with reference to the contract itself One must not refer to an implied warranty against defects being present
The aedilitian actions are the actio redhibitoria and the actio quanti minoris both of which are available in South African law Each action provides the aggrieved buyer with certain specific remedies Each has some similar elements
The actions are available in the case of defects
Defects and diseases
This matter is canvassed by Kerr There is little need then to detail it here As far as defects are concerned Corbett JA's words in Holmdene still apply The remedies lie only if the disease or defect existed at the time of sale Kerr says
Aedilitian actions do not lie if the thing sold was sound at the time of the sale although it had suffered previously from a disease or defect It is important that it should be wholly sound not merely a defective part that should have been repaired or replaced Just as the actions do not lie if the thing having previously been diseased or defective is sound at the time of sale so also they do not lie if the thing was sound at the time of sale but became diseased and defective thereafter
The existence of the disease or defect at the time of the sale is a question of fact that the buyer must prove on the balance of probabilities An inference that the disease or defect existed at the time of sale may be drawn from the fact that the disease or defect manifests itself shortly after the sale
Obviously the buyer does not have to prove that the defect was apparent at the time of sale Where the subject matter of the sale is a class of goods bags of maize for example or pockets of oranges the aedilitian remedies apply Yet the extent to which the buyer is entitled to redhibition is determined by whether the contract was divisible or indivisible Mackeurtan states The redhibition to which the purchaser is entitled extends only to the affected articles unless the contract may properly be regarded as an indivisible one for the sale of the articles as a whole
Adversus ea
The seller must sell the property in contravention of the edict in other words must defy the requirements of the edict by failing to disclose the existence of the defect The ordinary rules of non-disclosure apply here but the facts of the case determine which of the two actions is appropriate
The actio redhibitoria is an action for the cancellation of the contract and restitution It involves the restoration of the parties buyer and seller to their original positions as far as this is possible One is not entitled to a claim for one's consequential loss id quod interesse in terms of this remedy
The test to determine whether the buyer is entitled to redhibition is objective In Reid Brothers v Bosch the test was expressed in two ways
In other words the defect must be material if it is to justify redhibition Whether the buyer is entitled to redhibitory or quanti minoris relief depends therefore on the seriousness of the defect The defect must not be merely trifling?it must hinder or prevent the usefulness or serviceability of the thing?if it is to justify complete redhibition
If redhibition is applicable the buyer is entitled to a refund of the purchase price plus interest and of course reimbursement for useful or necessary improvements made to the res The buyer is obliged however to inform the seller of the defect and to tender a return of the thing plus accessories appurtenances and fruits
The buyer's right to redhibitory relief is terminated in the following circumstances
Where the article has been destroyed as a result of the defect itself or in the course of its normal use or accidentally the buyer is still entitled to redhibitory relief
The actio quanti minoris also known as the actio aestimatoria is the other action to be considered here an action for the return of a portion of the purchase price The actio quanti minoris may be sought as a remedy in two circumstances
In the first instance the basic requirements for an actio redhibitoria are the same as those that give rise to the actio quanti minoris Wherever such circumstances are present as justify complete redhibition the buyer has an election to choose which of the two actions he prefers If he has this choice he may
The actio quanti minoris may also be sought in a second set of circumstances Where the defect is of such a character that it is not material enough to give rise to a redhibitory action it may nevertheless give rise to an actio quanti minoris A buyer may therefore claim a reduction in the purchase price if despite the defect he would still have entered into the contract but at a lower price A buyer may sue for a redhibitory action claiming quanti minoris damages in the alternative
When the actio quanti minoris is utilised the buyer if successful is entitled to the return of a portion of the purchase price The actual amount is calculated on the basis of the difference between the purchase price and the actual value of the thing sold
The calculation of the award in current South African law is different from that of Roman law where the amount awarded would be calculated on the basis of the difference between the price actually given and the price the purchaser would have paid if he had known of the defect It is in other words a subjective test In South African law the measure of relief is usually the difference between the actual purchase price and the value of the article in its defective state The value of the defective thing must be ascertained as it is in the case of failure to make available the thing sold by reference to the market price if there is one If no market price can be established the best evidence available must be used to establish the actual value of the thing sold Another means of assessing the amount recoverable is by referring to the cost of repairing the defect that existed at the time of sale and/or remedying any deterioration that might have occurred as a result of the defect Only reasonable costs of repair may be taken into account in this regard
A measure of controversy exists as to the date to be used when determining the actual value of the thing sold After considering the cases Kerr comes to the conclusion that the relevant date is the date when the sale took place
Where the sale involves a res vendita consisting of a number of articles and one or more of them is defective the quanti minoris relief exists only in respect of the defective articles If the sale is indivisible however the buyer is entitled to relief only if a valuation of all the articles both defective and sound clearly shows that he has received less than he has contracted for
The right to claim quanti minoris damages is lost where the buyer knowing of the defect accepts the article as satisfactory in terms of the contract
The aedilitian remedies as defences
Circumstances that entitle the buyer to redhibition or to a reduction of the purchase price entitles him to defend on the basis of these facts actions for payment of the purchase price or any other action arising out of the contract When the buyer is sued by the seller therefore he is entitled to deny liability and claim redhibitory relief as a defence if the defect is material The same rules apply as above This is known as the exceptio redhibitoria
Circumstances that give cause for an actio quanti minoris may also be used as a defence to an action for the price by the seller This is called the exceptio quanti minoris
Exclusion of liability for defects
The following are circumstances in which the seller is not liable for latent defects in the res vendita
The only of these circumstances to be examined in detail here is the first
It is competent for the parties to agree that the seller shall not be liable for the presence of diseases or defects The most famous example is the voetstoots clause Where the thing is sold voetstoots it is sold with all its faults or as it stands or as it is The term must expressly form part of the contract it cannot be implied
The effect of such a sale is that the seller is not liable for defects in the res vendita Where there is an inspection of the thing by an expert this does not necessarily make the sale voetstoots It is important to note however that the voetstoots clause affects only the presence of latent diseases and defects it does not cover the situation where a misrepresentation of any kind is made
One big exception attaches to the voetstoots clause A voetstoots clause does not relieve the seller of responsibility for a defective res vendita when the seller has acted fraudulently since no-one can contract out of fraud
There has been some polemic between the Natal courts and those in the Transvaal and the Cape as to what is meant by fraud in this context Following a note by Milne the Natal courts took the view that a seller who knew of the defect and yet sold voetstoots was not fraudulent unless he designedly concealed the defect from the purchaser The Cape and Transvaal courts however held that knowledge of the defect coupled with a voetstoots clause was in itself sufficient to render the seller fraudulent
These difficulties were finally cleared up by the Appellate Division in Van der Merwe v Meades The latest case on the point is Odendaal v Ferraris
There is also some debate about the effect of the Consumer Protection Act on the voetstoots clause
Where there is an express term of the contract in apparent conflict with a voetstoots clause a question arises as to whether the buyer has an action against the seller The answer depends on the ambit of the term in the circumstances If the term extends beyond the field of aedilitian liability the voetstoots clause may not assist the seller For example a second-hand car is sold the seller having guaranteed that the car has a new camshaft and the car is sold voetstoots If the seller delivers the car with a new camshaft he is not liable for latent defects in that new camshaft If the camshaft is not new however the buyer has the usual remedies for breach of contract which have nothing to do with aedilitian remedies
National Credit Act excludes the possibility of a valid voetstoots clause in a sale subject to that Act
Dicta et promissa
The Romans recognised that where a seller made a statement amounting to a dictum et promissum and where the res vendita did not measure up to that statement the buyer was entitled to aedilitian relief In such cases there is no latent defect the problem comes in that the concept of the thing created in the buyer's mind by the seller's dictum et promissum is different from the true character of the thing These remedies are relevant where a representation is made but it falls short of a contractual warranty
In South African law despite any distinctions between dicta and promissa in the Roman law the term refers to a statement or undertaking or promise by the seller which was intended to be acted upon by the parties The leading case on dictum promissumve is Phame Pty Ltd v Paizes Holmes JA posed one of the questions raised by the case in the following way Can an innocent misrepresentation ever entitle a buyer to a reduction of the price under the actio quanti minoris If so under what circumstances In other words what factual foundation is required
The answer as he saw it was this
What has to be considered is not innocent misrepresentation per se but the dictum et promissum of the Roman-Dutch law and the consequential aedilitian relief It is both unnecessary and confusing to try to fit a dictum et promissum into some modern juristic niche like a warranty or term and then to draw conclusions therefrom as to the buyer's rights The Roman-Dutch authorities in particular do not require this
Those authorities he described as simple and clear on the point
If there is a latent defect at the time of sale ipso facto the aedilitian remedy is available unless excluded by agreement The seller's obligation and the buyer's right arise by operation of law and not by reference to the intention of the parties Similarly if during the negotiations the seller made a dictum et promissum bearing on the quality of the res vendita and it falls short of it ipso facto the aedilitian remedy is available by operation of law
In summary on a conspectus of all the authorities decisions and discussions he considered the law in South Africa on this question to be as follows
Point 4 above makes it quite clear that a mere puff does not amount to a dictum et promissum

Buyer's residual obligations
Payment of purchase price
Manner of payment
The buyer is required to pay the purchase price in the manner agreed upon in the contract This is certainly his most important duty Should the contract say nothing specific in this regard the obligation must be established in terms of the previous course of dealings between the parties or by relevant trade usage Failing these as Mackeurtan notes he must pay it in legal tender Payment may be made by cheque depending upon its being honoured Performance other than of what is due called substituted performance or datio in solutum may be rendered if the creditor consents if he does consent and the payment is so rendered the obligation is validly discharged
Time of payment
Cash sales
In the absence of agreement to the contrary both parties are obliged to perform as soon as the contract is entered into The buyer must tender payment therefore when the seller is bound to make available the thing sold In Breytenbach v Van Wyk Wessels JA said In a sale for cash the article must be delivered pari passu with the payment of the purchase price
Credit sales
A particular day may be agreed upon for payment if not payment must be made within a reasonable time Where delivery by instalments is agreed upon the buyer is prima facie required to pay the correct portion of the price on delivery of each instalment
Place of payment
The buyer is required to pay the price at the place fixed in the contract Where no place has been fixed the buyer is required to ensure that payment reaches the creditor on or before the due date
Payment by whom
In ordinary circumstances the buyer is responsible for the price but payment by a third party either on behalf of the debtor or as surety or co-debtor also discharges the obligation
Removal or receipt
The buyer has a duty to remove the thing when it is made available by the seller or to receive it if it is brought to him The classic statement of this duty is that of Pomponius If a man buys the stone on an estate and refuses to remove it an action on sale may be brought to enforce removal
Where a buyer fails to remove or receive the thing timeously he is in mora This has implications for the burden of the risk and entitles the seller to reimbursement for necessary expenditure in the upkeep and storage of the res vendita
Reimbursement of necessary expenses
The buyer is required to reimburse the seller for any expenses necessarily incurred in caring for the res vendita between the date of sale and the seller's making the thing available This duty corresponds to the seller's duty to take due care of the thing until it is made available it also corresponds with his duty to account to the buyer for fruits of the res vendita from the date of sale Examples of this type of expenses include the cost of warehousing necessary repairs taxes maintenance and keep the cost of a nightwatchman for example to ensure the safety of the res vendita or monies spent on the veterinary treatment of an animal
Seller's remedies
The seller's remedies where the buyer fails to fulfil one or more of these obligations are numerous and detailed
Sales subject to statutory requirements
Various statutes regulate the way certain common forms of sale contracts must be concluded and performed These statutes provide a gloss and in some cases a significant alteration to the common law of sale discussed thus far For the most part these pieces of legislation are designed with consumer protection in mind They impose formalities upon contracts and they stipulate what sorts of terms are lawful or unlawful
The following are significant pieces of legislation


Traditional music in Kosovo

Musical folklore of Kosovo is rich with rare and unique elements Kosovo's folklore claims roots in the 6th?5th centuries BC
Traditional music genesis in Kosovo
In the past epic poetry in Kosovo and northern Albania was sung on a lahuta a one-string fiddle and then a more tuneful ciftelia was used which has two strings ? one for the melody and one for drone Kosovar music is influenced by Turkish music since the entire region spent 500 years as part of the Ottoman Empire but the Kosovar folklore preserved originality Archaeological researches tells about how old this tradition is and how it was developed in a parallel way with other traditional music in Balkan Lots of roots were found in the 5th century BC like paintings in stones showing singers with instruments In the famous the portrait Pani was shown holding an instrument similar to a flute
Traditional music genres
Rapsodi
Rapsodi is a special traditional music genre Rapsodi are poetry mainly about homeland war and famous warriors They are always accompanied with original Kosovar instruments such as Ciftelia or Sharkia In a special way they are patriotic songs which are dedicated to brave warriors continuous wars against the Turks and Serbians Rapsodi is also known for its charismatic interpretation for the old traditional Kosovo away from every oriental element that represents for the clear pronunciation of the word for its distinctive vocals gestures and acting in singing as well Their topics were very real because they always tell a homeland story by singing
Here are some famous rapsodi verses
E nÅfPrishtine atje pike sÅf pari
Krisi topi o me duhi
Atje gjaku o i shqiptarit
Ra ne toke me bi perseri
Sofrat
Sofrat represents a group of male artists and singers who sing together siting around the table Their songs are mostly folklore with different social topics which are followed by generations These songs are accompanied with many instruments The musicians are also part of sofra Sofrat organized into traditional orders represent a precious treasure of cultural heritage in Kosovo Lots of traditional artists have become famous from their interpretations in Sofra Depending from the rhythm sofra songs can be accompanied with various traditional dances
Most popular sofras are Sofra Pejane,Sofra Gjakovare etc
Nowadays sofra continues to be very popular and present at almost every wedding It happens to be organized also as a part of cultural program in some cities
Wedding songs
These songs are characteristic for weddings They are separated in two parts The first part are songs for the bride before she gets married They're usually accompanied with Def ? a traditional instrument and are similar to poetry Most of those songs are original creations that are a momentary dedication for that person getting married The second part are songs for the couple They are accompanied with lots of instruments and have interesting topics Some of them express congratulations for the couple characteristics of living together etc Wedding songs usually go together with specific traditional dance therefore they are interesting and important because they also represents lots of general Kosovar tradition information
One of the most famous Wedding Song is

Hajde Marshalla
Hidheni vallen goca
Hajde me sevda
Dirge Kenge Vaji
It is one of the most famous Albanian characteristics They represent an original and very emotional creations which are dedicated to a close and beloved person after their death It is specific because it is an art born from the suffering This genre is almost the oldest It has many variations and it is very popular because it has to do with a special condition that people confront in their daily life Dirge can be created by from one or more persons The most difficult and rarest variation is the polyphonic Dirge because it needs four participants to be in a harmony
Vocal Characteristics of Polifonic Dirge
Lullabies
Lullabies are short poetic monologues where the parents express their wishes about their children before sleep The most usual artistic and literary figures that are used are comparison and personification They are also lyrical Their characteristic is that most of them start with Nani-nani djalin/vajzen or Nina-nana Lullabies are the finest representation about expressing parental love and the irreplaceable role of family in Kosovo tradition
Well-known kosovar lullaby is

Traditional music instruments
Ciftelia
Ciftelia is an original unique instrument in Kosovo This is a two-stringed instrument in which one string is used for the drone and one for the melody It is a wooden instrument with a small head and a long tail It is used in a style of dance and pastoral songs mostly on Kosovo and it is known as a Gheg Instrument Together with Sharkia it represent a strongly traditional instrument and has characteristics of rapsodian genre
Sharkia
Sharkia is a traditional instrument usually with five wires 2+1+2 There are also some other kinds of sharkia one of them is with 12 wires SharkiaÅfs sounds are deep and vibrant

Rincon de Luz orphanage

Rincon de Luz is a fictional orphanage and the primary setting for the first four and the last two seasons of the Argentine television series Chiquititas The exceptions are Chiquititas Season Five where the story takes place in a granary and Chiquititas Sin Fin in which the children have a different home
Rincon de Luz literally Corner Of Light is also the title of a Chiquititas spin-of series that shares a similar plot created by Cris Morena The title Rincon de Luz replaced the previous one of Chiquititas since Morena could not use the previous title due to copyright issues Soon before its premiere she stated that Chiquititas was more than a title
The same name is used in the Chiquititas
The manor is located at the Pasaje del Sauce 829 in Buenos Aires
Story
Before the Corner
The original Rincon de Luz orphanage was idealized by Ramiro Moran in order to hide his new born granddaughter whose mother Gabriela was too young and had the baby with a humble man The baby grew up in the house and became Mili the first orphan to be sheltered by the place She lived with Saverio the adorable Chef of the Morans and Ernestina its rigurous janitor The place then became home of seven other girls who were actually orphans and formed among themselves a family they all guilded by Mili
The orphans periodically received the visit of Belen Saverio's endearing goddaughter who was studying to become a social assistant They were also monitored by Emilia the first woman to direct the orphanage until she was fired by Carmen an ambitious woman and Ramiro's sister She always managed to control his whole fortune and wanted the own the house where Rincon de Luz was located The house was also wanted by Ginette Ramiro's ultimate and several years younger fiancee whose father was supposedly its original owner
Through Ramiro Ginette then replaced Emilia as the orphanage's administratrix what prevented Belen to accept Martin's proposal to occupy the position Martin was Ramiro's son and Belen's first romantic interest in the series and the first one to offer her a posisiton she would later assume
Ginette initially proved to be lovable to the chiquititas but was later unmasked by Jimena one of them
Belen was then nominated the newest Rincon de Luz director by Ramiro himself moments before his tragic death and so she became Her act would change the orphan's lives forever
The Corner of Light
After Carmen managed to own the house Belen and the orphans were forced to leave their home until a mysterious man Pedro Vega donated them a new one Their newest house was a huge manor located at the corner of the Pasaje del Sauce street The place then became the ultimate version of Rincon de Luz
The orphans discovered that some areas and artefacts inside the manor were actually magical such as La Ventanita de Los Suenos The Magic Window that took place in the attic Belen's bedroom Through the Window the orphans could see their inner dreams and illusions becoming truer to life The Window shared a similar function with a magic mirror where the children could see their dreams if looking with only one eye
The manor also had some areas that could work as traps and other hidden places
This new setting was introduced at the same time the story gained new overtones The melodramatic plots were left as the number of adult characters was reduced giving place to more children-centered plots
The Granary
Years after Belen and her chiquititas storyline ended the Book of Life in which she had written their story was somehow found by Maria a girl who lived in the streets with some other children They later found a huge picturesque granary where Joaquin a lonely old man lived His only company was an enormous tree located in the middle of the granary until the place then became the children's newest home Following the Book's stories Maria names it Rincon de Luz
An adorable woman called Ana arrived from the skies in a ballon and gradually assumed Belen's role in the life of the granary's orphans She fell in love with Juan Maza a widowed man who lived nearby the granary in his mansion with his seven children and Ana changed his life as well
The granary was burned down after they got married and left for honeymoon by Juan's angry ex-fiancee Pia She managed to send the orphans alongside some of Juan's children as well as her own daughter Tali to a household where kids where treated as slaves the Shadow orphanage There a shiny leaf felt right on Maria's hands which Toya explained that the Tree was saying goodbye to them Camila interpreted this as an advice for the chiquititas to not lose their hope Pia insanely burned down the granary and died in her own fire
After escaping from the Shadow house the children discovered that Ana and Juan died in an airplane crash and that now they were left orphans and homeless
Back to the Corner
Fearing being sent back to the Shadow house the remaining chiquititas stood homeless Maria insistently kept the Book of Life believing that to be the right moment to find the original Rincon de Luz described in the story Following a magic star they were then sent to the manor in the Corner which was the very same from the past except for its insides
The orphans discover a chimerical place full of toys dolls and games and through the Magic Window in the attic they discover that they actually found their Rincon de Luz as Belen herself tells them in a vision
Somehow the manor also became a gateway to a magical world inhabited by elves and fairies where Maria befriends Tok the Elf Also in the library the fairy tales come from their books to life
The reason the house was reformed is later clarified to the orphans through old documents found by them in a hidden office inside the manor The house's owner Rafael Sander wanted it to be exclusively reformulated for his upcoming son Unfornunately his pregnant wife died in a car crash and Sander was left in sorrow His loyal valet Enzo tries to expel the orphans from the manor stating that it was an orphanage now it's a private place The kids stay insistent against Sander's bitterness
He hid himself in the manor's hidden places lurking the children and a newcomer young woman named Luz but was later discovered by Juanita Luz became the newest maternal figure for the orphans and later the orphanage's director after it is legalized by the Juvenile Court She had to struggle against Sander's angry and Paula's ambition to own the house she believes is hers
Paula was Sander's deceased wife's identical twin sister who had always loved him and still does but in the end Luz and Sander get married and he gives the manor to Luz as a gift
Due to the vilanious acts of Lidia a unscrupulous woman who assumed the house's administration in Luz and Rafael's absence the manor was knocked down leaving the children in desperation However the manor magically rebuilt itself for them as the spirit of Belen appeared in the skies
In film
In the Chiquititas feature film the name of Rincon de Ninos Huerfanos Corner for Orphans is changed to Rincon de Luz after Belen Alejo and the children assume the house becoming altogether a family
Other versions
In the successful Brazilian adaptation of the story the orphanage is named Raio de Luz Light Gleam and features adventure and fantasy stories unexplored in the original version such as the children discovering a hidden treasure in the manor's surroundings The manor was supposedly destroyed in the end of Season Four and was set to return as a main setting in future seasons which did not happen due to Chiquititas Brasil cancelation
Also in this version the Tree located in the middle of the granary is a gateway to a magical subterranean Wonderland-like world known as The Anthill There the orphans meet fantastic creatures such as talking ants and flowers No explanation about its origin is given although Estrela tells the orphans that the Tree was there years before she was born The granary was built around the Tree in order to protect it

The founding of Awka-Etiti is ascribed in all versions of oral history to Diedo In some versions he was the son of Ezenne Ezenne seems to have been a brother to Uke and Ojoto Ezenne had two sons and a daughter The sons were Okwuike and Diedo while the daughter was Edo The daughter Edo was married to Ezemewi who legend ascribes the founding of Nnewi to Okwuike is reputed to be the father of Nnobi Diedo had an only son called Okagbado
At the death of Ezenne a disagreement over the sharing of the late father's assets arose between Okwuike and Diedo which led to Diedo and his son Okagbado leaving their ancestral home along the Obiaja river to settle at a spot called Ogwuwgu Diedo in present-day Iruowelle village Awka-Etiti
Okagbado married three wives who gave him nine sons The first wife gave birth to Ezioka and Umoh The second wife had Nkolofia Ejighnandu Iruowelle and Ogunzele while the third wife had Ocha Dunuezue and Nnaba These made up the original nine villages of Awka-Etiti
Umoh and Ezioka engaged themselves in a bloody fratricidal war for reasons which are unclear Both parties made use of mercenary head hunters from Ohafia and Abam The brutality of the conflict led to the near extinction of both villages The remnants of Ezioka were later absorbed by Nkolofia village while the survivors of Umoh were absorbed by Ejighinandu village leaving Awka-Etiti with seven villages to the present day
In the period between ca 1760 and 1900 the development of Awka-Diedo was marked by an unending series of fierce wars with surrounding towns as a result of expansionist tendencies Especially Nnewi engaged Awka-Diedo in a series of vicious battles spanning many centuries over boundary issues Nnokwa Amichi Azigbo and Ichida were also at war with Awka-Diedo at various times during this period The tenacity and bravery displayed by Awka-Etiti warriors on the battlefield as well as their repertoire of cunning tactics such as tunnelling behind the enemy lines and booby traps installed respect in their enemies and earned them the nickname Awka-Nkakwu nkakwu is Igbo language for skunk This nickname earned by Awka-Etiti warriors in battle was later used to refer to the whole town by its neighbours As E.R Dallah and E.C Nzewi explain
It is reputed that though Nnewi spent huge amounts to secure the services of Abam and Ohafia mercenary head hunter troops to ensure the annihilation of Awka-Nkakwu they were unable to achieve a decisive victory This was possible also thanks to a powerful military alliance which existed between Awka-Etiti and Oraukwu warriors who used to come to each other's aid in times of war
Colonial era
This state of affairs continued until the arrival of the British punitive expeditions between 1883 and 1906 By this time Awka-Etiti had been identified by the colonialists as being a hindrance to the further advance of British influence to the hinterland Awka-Etiti was deemed resistant to British policy and refused to comply with the demand to surrender their firearms That Awka-Etiti was considered hostile by the establishment is evidenced by the fact that while the first Church Mission Society C.M.S church and school was built in Nnewi in 1892 it was not until 1904 that the first white person in form of the C.M.S missionary Mrs Mary Bennett was peacefully received on Awka-Etiti soil Indeed it was not until the Fifth of February 1905 that the first official representative of His MajestyÅfs government in the person of then Lt.Col later Lieutenant Governor of southern Nigeria H.C Moorhouse was received peacefully by Warrant Chief Ezenwosu in Awka-Etiti In this area therefore it took the British 12 years to extend their influence over a distance of not more than 2 km Thus Awka-Etiti had been felt as a thorn in the flesh by the colonial administration
Prior to this however in 1900 Awka-Etiti had met their match in the British expeditionary force In this year a peace meeting was arranged by the British between Awka-Etiti and Nnewi to settle border disputes The interpreter at this crucial meeting Mr Nwokedi was a Nnewi indigene This led to a situation where Awka-Etiti came to believe that a peace agreement had been reached while the British mediators present at the meeting were told that Awka-Etiti had categorically declined a peaceful settlement The unsuspecting Awka-Etiti representatives went back home to spread the good news that the white man had brought peace between Awka-Etiti and Nnewi Consequently the Awka-Etiti warriors were stood down and demobilised
Great was the consternation therefore when the British Southern Nigeria Regiment led by Nnewi scouts launched a massive pre-dawn surprise attack on Awka-Etiti A hastily organised counterattack by Awka-Etiti warriors against the superiorly armed and dug in British troops ended in a fiasco Leading the counterattack against the British positions was the Ochiagha commander of war This man an experienced General and veteran of many wars was reputed by friends and enemies alike to be completely bullet and arrow proof a feat which he had used to good effect on many previous occasions His being bullet proof was attributed to a powerful magic juju which he had acquired from his mothers family who were strong native doctors in Ichida It was therefore a most unforgettable experience when the British forces opened fire on the Awka-Etiti warriors at long range with maxim guns and heavy artillery A bullet smashed the Ochiagha`s arm at the elbow with blood gushing which forced him to drop his weapon On seeing this the Awka-Etiti men were demoralised and lost hope of victory The troops routed the Ochiagha and his bravest warriors losing their lives to the British in a last suicidal charge at the enemy positions The surviving ringleaders and prominent warriors fled into exile to their relations in Igbo-Ukwu and as far away as Neni The rest of Awka-Etiti was compelled to give up their firearms to the British at the Eke market square where they were destroyed This incident ended the era of inter-communal wars between Awka-Etiti and her neighbours
Christian era
In 1904 the first missionary workers led by Mrs Mary Bennett made their appearance in Awka-Etiti The first C.M.S mission church was built in Iruowelle village In 1913 the Roman Catholic mission was also introduced to the Town which built a church and a school These two churches rapidly led to a conversion of the majority of Awka-Etiti citizens to Christianity In 1944 the Awka-Etiti Improvement Union A.I.U was formed which was the governing body of Awka-Etiti taking over the mantle of leadership from the traditional Council of Elders meeting Okwu Azu-Oji The name of the town was officially changed to Awka-Etiti by the A.I.U in 1946
In 1957 the Awka-Etiti Improvement Union decided to elect the first Obi King of Awka-Etiti This desire to have a king was based on the creation of the Eastern house of Chiefs by the then colonial Eastern Regional Government in 1956 and the intention of Awka-Etiti to secure a seat on this legislative body Awka-Etiti from antiquity did not traditionally have a king although two warrant chiefs had been appointed by the British after 1900 The first was Chief Ezenwosu on whose death Chief Oyiatuigbo was appointed warrant chief by the British in 1915 until his death in 1954
The elections for the Igwe`s stool were held on 29 July 1957 with H R H IGWE Dr Silas O.C Ezenwa emerging as the first Obi of Awka-Etiti The second and present Obi is H.R.H Chief Joachin Ojukwu Akum 1 of Awka-Etiti
Culture
The culture of Awka-Etiti is oriented on Omenala and is typical of the Igbo culture being steeped in Igbo art and Igbo music While several cultural activities and festivals of old having been associated with ancient pagan gods and rites have ceased to be performed since the advent of Christianity such as the Ilo Muo and Igba Ota ceremonies there are several traditional institutions that have persisted to the present day
Festivals
Some ancient traditional festivals have been Christianised and merged with existing Christian rituals The Afia Nkwu and eight days later the Kamanu festivals in late December and early January for example which marked the end of the old Igbo calendar have been largely superseded by the Christmas and New Year celebrations of the present day Some ancient traditional festivals celebrated in the town have been adapted to fit present needs and context such as the Iwa Ji New Yam festival in August Afia Olu and Ofala are other traditional holidays still actively observed in Awka-Etiti
Odunke festival
The famous Odunke festival which served as inspiration and name giver to a talented group of Biafran artists including Chinua Achebe and Christopher Okigbo Odunke community of Artists is worthy of special mention as it seems to be peculiar to Awka-Etiti It is one of the festivals that had no religious basis It was rather a carnival with grand ceremony feasting as well as a display of material wealth opulence and social status incorporating all the arts of the community in a harmonious relationship The Odunke was last performed in 1955
Nze na Ozo
As is typical of Igboland the institution of traditional chieftaincy title holders Nze na Ozo is ingrained in Awka-Etiti There are two grades of traditional title in Awka-Etiti The first grade ist the Ozo title which consists of the following groups of titles Ezissi Okpala Isiokolo Ikiwi and Ozala Of these the Ezissi is the most senior with the responsibility of appeasing the various gods and deities historically befalling on the most senior Ezissi title holder in the Community
The second grade of chieftaincy title is the Nnukwu-Ozo High-Ozo The Nnukwu-Ozo titles in Awka-Etiti fall into these categories Ezeani Dunu Dim Dallah and Umeh and can traditionally only be conferred on candidates who had previously been initiated into the first grade of Ozo title and who had been seen to have proved their pedigree in battle or through other most notable endeavours
The initiation into these Nnukwu-Ozo titles was and still is very expensive Historically the initiation ceremony into the secrets of the Nnukwu-Ozo involved the very painful and prestigious Ichi scarification by which these men were identified in public The Ichi scarification as part of the ritual has been discontinued in modern times for aesthetic reasons The last bearer of Ichi marks Chief Ezenwosu died in the early twentieth century Other distinctive pieces of regalia that identify the Ozo title holder and the Nnukwu-Ozo title holder in Awka-Etiti are the red cap with eagle feathers for the Nnukwu-Ozo the horse tail fly whisk the round cow hide fan and the elephant tusk
Taboos
The killing or eating of Eke snake Python regius and Dog Canis lupus familiaris is anathema in Awka-Etiti these having been considered sacred animals associated with local deities by the ancients
Education
Awka-Etiti has various primary schools in the seven villages including Nkolofia primary school Father Pauls Memorial primary and secondary school Union primary school Umunocha primary school and Central school among others St Josephs secondary school was founded in 1962 by the Catholic community and later served as a refugee camp and teaching hospital during the Nigerian Civil War The Girls secondary school was founded in 1964 by the then Obi of Awka-Etiti H R H IGWE Dr S.O.C Ezenwa
The first university graduates from Awka-Etiti were Mr E.R Dallah 1955 Dr.A A Okoye 1956 and Chief O F Obi 1957 The first medical doctors from Awka-Etiti graduated about 1965 in the persons of Chief Dr Francis E Ezissi Ife Awka-Etiti a
German trained surgeon Dr Samuel Ezenwa an American trained surgeon and Dr George Udenkwo Gynaecologist trained in Ireland
Health
In 1958 the existing maternity home was converted to a health centre by the Eastern Nigerian Government This was the only health institution until the early 1980s when the first indigenous medical doctors opened a series of private hospitals including St Francis Specialist Hospital and Mortuary Kanayo Specialist Hospital and Marternity Idemili Specialist Hospital as well as the Roman Catholic Fatima Hospital
Economy
Awka-Etiti has been noted as one of the driving forces behind the development of industrialisation in Igbo land Business men and women from the Town had successfully specialised in the importation of bicycles and bicycle parts by the early 1940s After The Nigerian Civil War Awka-Etiti entrepreneurs established a number of renowned manufacturing industries notably the G.M.O Group of Companies and the Roadmaster Industries Ltd More recently established industries are the IKB cosmetics product line and the Interbau Construction Company Ltd Thousands of job opportunities in Nigeria and beyond have been provided directly and indirectly by these and other industries and business ventures rooted in Awka-Etiti
Infrastructure
Most of the roads in Awka-Etiti are tarred has been possible thanks only to individual philanthropic and community efforts In this regard Awka-Etiti is representative of the situation in the neighbouring towns and Igboland where little or no government induced infrastructural development has been felt Despite this the Iruowelle Youths Association and the Umunocha Development Association have been most prominent in tarring the roads in their villages Beyond that several important link roads have been tarred by the single handed efforts of philanthropic citizens
People
Some prominent sons and daughters of Awka-Etiti are and have been


List of natural disasters in Indonesia

Natural disasters in Indonesia can usefully be divided into major disasters medium level disasters and lesser disasters which although causing less damage are very common across Indonesia These can conveniently be considered as macro mezzo and micro events Policies to respond to natural disasters in Indonesia which are still in an early stage of being developed need to develop strategies to deal with each of these different types of disasters
Macro Major natural disasters with widespread loss of life
The following is a list of main natural disasters that have occurred in Indonesia during recent history which have led to major loss of life
1 Total death toll unknown The eruption is believed to have had a worldwide impact.<br>
2 This is the estimated death toll from the direct impact of the eruption A total of perhaps 70,000 people are estimated to died from starvation and disease in the area in the months following the eruption See also 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora.<br>
3 Some thousands are reported to have died.<br>
4 Source MCEER University of Buffalo The State University of New York Major Indonesian Earthquakes of the 20th Century accessed 29 December 2013.<br>
5 This is the estimated death toll in Indonesia An estimated 60,000 more people died in other countries surrounding the Indian Ocean especially in Sri Lanka
Mezzo Medium level natural disasters
In addition to the disasters listed in the table above there are a large number of natural disasters in Indonesia which cause medium levels of loss of life here defined roughly as between 50 to 500 deaths or which give rise to large numbers of internally displaced refugees sometimes for some months or more Some recent examples of these include the following
Note Estimates of the numbers of evacuees can vary considerably in short periods of time In some cases large numbers of people move away from a threatened area but return to their homes as soon as possible It is often the case in Indonesia that people are reluctant to move away from their homes or stay away long because of worries about loss of property through theft and because of the need to look after local farms and cattle Figures listed here are generally the peak numbers although sometimes different sources provide different estimates
Micro Lesser natural disasters
There is a large number of smaller natural disasters in Indonesia each year which often lead to deaths of 10 or 20 people or more For example landslides tanah longsor are very common in upland areas especially during the rainy season and cause much local damage and deaths
Flooding is also a regular problem across many parts of Indonesia The capital city Jakarta is subject to severe floods from time to time which usually cause some loss of life and significant damage to public and commercial infrastructure In January 2014 for example over 20 people lost their lives during widespread flooding and at one stage over 60,000 citizens were temporarily housed in nearly 250 evaluation shelters across the city
In many rural areas local flooding is very common and brings loss of life as well as much local inconvenience to economic and community life Recent examples of these sorts of problems at the regional level include
National outlook
2014
According to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency BNPB or Badan Nasional Penanggulanan Bencana as many as 566 people were killed by natural disasters and displaced over 2.6 million in Indonesia in 2014 Almost all of the disasters were classified as hydro-meteorological events Tornadoes were the most common natural disaster 496 events followed by floods 458 events and landslides 413 events Landslides caused the most deaths estimated at around 343 people

Haddam Island State Park

Haddam Island State Park is an undeveloped island in the lower Connecticut River in the town of Haddam Connecticut in the United States Originally used by the Wangunk tribe the island was reserved for their use as part of a land sale to English colonists in May 1662 In the 19th?century the island was used for fishing and farming The early 20th?century saw it as a place of public recreation and the State of Connecticut purchased the island and made it a state park in 1944 The park is only accessible by boat and recommended activities are boating fishing and birdwatching
History
The English settlers in the Connecticut Colony originally named the island Thirty Mile Island because it was erroneously believed to be north of the Connecticut River's mouth The original English settlement in the area was called Thirty Mile Island Plantation In May 1662 an area of of land including the island was sold by the Wangunk tribe to the English settlers for 30 coats However the natives reserved the right to use the island as part of the sale stipulations Though little documentation exists today the Wangunk tribe lived on the island and in the surrounding area before selling it along with the rest of their land Recorded deeds show that the Wangunk tribe made another land sale in 1672 and the remaining parcels of Wangunk land were sold between 1765 and 1769
At the close of the 18th?century the island was one of the most important fishing locations on the Connecticut River By 1819 the island was listed as in area and was expected to increase in size following the construction of a pier 90 rods north of the island which caused the accumulation of sand at the head of the island The island is currently listed as in size In the 19th?century two fishing companies operated from the island and constructed piers and the island was also used for grazing cattle and farming corn Records in the late 19th?century indicate that the Haddam Island area of the Connecticut River was dredged annually The island became a popular recreational area with picnics and private events in the beginning of the 20th?century The island was purchased by the State of Connecticut in 1944 and it became a state park According to legend Captain Kidd buried some of his treasure on the island but none has been found
Activities
Haddam Island State Park is home to a large number of bird species especially during annual migrations which make it suitable for birdwatching Bird-banding and other research activities have taken place on the island Other recommended activities are boating and fishing fishing was the historic use of the island from centuries ago To access to the island one must cross the Connecticut River and there is no parking area or fees The northern side of the island has a beach that is fragile and cannot support heavy visitation and the island has a significant amount of poison ivy The nearest access point is the Haddam Meadows State Park boat launch which features chemical toilets and parking


Fokker D.XII

The Fokker D.XII was a Dutch single seat single engine fighter aircraft designed to an American specification which called for the use of a Curtiss D-12 engine designated PW-7 Despite considerable efforts to improve the airframe Fokker failed to win the USAAS competition
Design and development
The D.XII owed its existence to the Fokker D.XI even though they had no design overlap the connection was that the earlier aircraft had some success when submitted to the USAAS's call for entrants in its PW-7 specification competition an order for three resulting The D.XII was intended from the start to meet this specification and was designed around the required Curtiss D-12 engine
Initially the D.XII was like the D.XI a single bay sesquiplane but its wings were different in plan and construction The upper wing was straight edged with some sweep on the leading edge it had a thinner aerofoil section than that of its predecessor and was fabric rather than plywood covered Overhung ailerons were used their ends projecting outboard of the squared wing tips proper acting as aerodynamic balances The lower wing which lacked ailerons was both much shorter in span and smaller in chord The early D.XII had a V-form interplane strut on each side another strut leant out from each wing root to the upper rear spar assisted ahead of it on each side by a short V-form pair linking the two spars to the upper fuselage longeron acting as N-form cabane struts
The fuselage of the D.XII was flat sided and deep from nose to tail Initially it had the same 300 hp 224?kW Hispano-Suiza 8F V-eight engine as its predecessor but this was soon replaced by the USAAS-specified 440?hp 328?kW V-twelve water-cooled Curtiss D-12 Both were enclosed by a metal cowlings though of slightly different shapes and drove a two blade propeller The single open cockpit was well to the rear about midway down the fuselage Its horizontal tail was braced and the fin was small carrying a balanced rudder that extended down to the keel The D.XII had a fixed conventional undercarriage of the single axle type supported by V struts There was a small tail skid
The first flight under Curtiss power was made on 21 August 1924 Flight testing followed resulting in major modifications The upper wing was given an unswept leading edge and hence had constant chord and the small lower wing was replaced by one with the same chord as the upper plane and a span almost its equal mounted with marked stagger No longer a sesquiplane the splayed V interplane struts were replaced with more rigid N-form ones Another bracing strut ran from the forward foot of the interplane strut to the top of the root to upper wing inner strut to further improve torsional strength At the rear the little fin was remove and the rudder still balanced reshaped Two more aircraft with these modifications were built
Despite Fokker's efforts the aircraft was still not to the liking of the USAAS who did not buy any of the three D.XIIs further development was abandoned


Church of Light

The Church of Light was incorporated November 2 1932 in Los Angeles California Its mission is Ågto teach practice and disseminate The Religion of The Stars a way of life for the Aquarian Age as set forth in writings of C.C Zain.Åh The Church of Light Vision for the 21st Century The three founding officers were President C.C Zain pen name of Elbert Benjamine 1882-1951 Vice President Fred Skinner 1872-1940 and Secretary-Treasurer Elizabeth D Benjamine 1875-1942).(The Church of Light Where We Are Located
Origins
The Church is the continuation of an initiatic organisation the Brotherhood of Light established in the same city in 1915 The Brotherhood of Light lessons were written over a twenty year period by Elbert Benjamine from 1914 through 1934 and continually revised by him until his death Benjamine had been invited in 1909 by the leaders of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor HBofL in Denver to join them as successor to Minnie Higgin who had been the orderÅfs astrologer until her death that year The surviving Council members proposed to Benjamine that he rewrite the orderÅfs teachings in a systematic form as the basis for a new organization that would Ågbring occultism to the life of ordinary people.Åh This change was inspired by orders from Max Theon to close the HBofL following the death of his wife the previous year After five years of preparation and study Elbert Benjamine came to Los Angeles in 1915 and began to hold meetings ÅgAt that point it still operated as a secret society On November 11 1918 the Brotherhood of Light opened its doors to the public offering classes and a home-study course.Åh The 1932 reorganization as The Church of Light was a response to ordinances passed that year by Los Angeles County Ågprohibiting both the teaching and practice of astrology.Åh
Influences
Astro-Philosophical Publications founded in Denver in 1892 was a publishing arm of the HBofL created by Henry and Belle Wagner The authors it published included Thomas H Burgoyne and Sarah Stanley Grimke both cited by Benjamine as sources of Brotherhood teachings He accorded the same status to Ghost Land and Art Magic by Emma Hardinge Britten Another early HBofL member Genevieve Stebbins relocated to California from England in 1917 with her husband Norman Astley and provided assistance to the Benjamines in establishing the Brotherhood of Light
Schisms
Following the 1943 remarriage of Elbert Benjamine his son and heir apparent Will Benjamine departed in acrimony and established the Stellar Ministry Åga short-lived religious group that taught a mixture of Hermeticism and Christianity.Åh Although the group did not survive Church of Light membership Ågnever quite recovered from these discords.Åh
Activities
The 21 volume Brotherhood of Light lessons are publicly accessible to nonmembers of the church but only members participate in a system of written examinations covering each volume Each examination passed advances the member one degree Seven volumes each are devoted to astrology alchemy and magic Students who complete all 21 degrees including examinations are awarded a ÅgHermeticianÅfs Certificate.Åh
Church headquarters were located through 1999 at 117 later 2341 Coral Street in Los Angeles which had been the home of the Benjamines After several years based in Brea California in 2005 it relocated to Albuquerque New Mexico Regular classes and services are held at its headquarters 2119 Gold Avenue many of which are viewable as live streams and archived on the church website The current president is Paul Brewer

Bad Breisig Final Palaeolithic site

History of investigation
In 1999 Georg Waldmann discovered an archaeological find scatter in the profile of a gravel quarry in the so-called Golden Mile Schirmer 1990 north of Bad Breisig Due to typical lithic specimens the concentration is attributed to the Final Palaeolithic Federmesser-Gruppen Waldmann / Joris / Baales 2001 Excavations were conducted in autumn 2000 and spring 2001 on behalf of the local office for the preservation of cultural heritage in Koblenz by the department for Palaeolithic Studies of the Romano-Germanic Central Museum Mainz These works yielded a concentration of burnt lithic and fanual material around a hearth of which approximately 50% were preserved Grimm 2004 The archaeological assemblage and the site were analysed in a M.A thesis at the Institute for Prehistory at the University of Cologne supervised by Gerhard Bosinski in close cooperation with department of Palaeolithic Studies at Schloss Monrepos Neuwied meanwhile MONREPOS where the finds are stored until today
Setting profile and dating
The archaeological site was placed on a lower terrace of the Rhine ÅgNiederterrasseÅh lower terrace 2 = NT2 Schirmer 1990 Baales et al 2001 West of the site the terrain slopes abruptly down by some 10 m to the modern floodplain of the Rhine The finds were recovered from slack water deposits ?HochflutlehmÅg which were overlaying material from the Laacher See volcanic eruption which is dated to the late Allerod ca 11.000 v Chr Baales et al 2002 The onset of the incision of the Rhine to the next terrace NT3 was generally assumed to start instantly after the volcanic eruption due to the high amount of pumice in the terrace deposits Schirmer 1990 Thus the formation of the slack water deposits containing the archaeological finds can be set to the transition from the Allerod to the Younger Dryas The settlement of the site is dated to the last part of the Allerod Greenland Interstadial 1a Lowe et al 2008 based on the stratigraphic position of the assemblage the temperate fauna Baales et al 2001 and the dominantly coniferous species determined by charcoal analysis Waldmann et al 2001 One of three 14C measurements dated to the transition between the Allerod and the Younger Dryas whereas the other two samples delivering considerably younger results suffered from presumable contaminations Baales et al 2001
Archaeological results
No other Final Palaeolithic site except Bad Breisig is thus far known from the time after the Laacher See eruption in the Central Rhineland whereas from time before the volcanic eruption several well preserved sites were found Baales 2002 The assemblage from Bad Breisig shows no significant changes to the remains of the well known Federmesser-Gruppen sites from before the eruption The structure of the site dense concentration around a hearth the activities performed on the site knapping / working place subsistence related activities as well as the exploitation of resources pinewood used as fuel generally red occasionally roe deer as alimentary resource mainly local Tertiary Quarzite more scarcely Flint from at least 100?km distance were used in the production of Stone tools and even the origins of the lithic raw materials are similar Grimm 2004 An indication for a younger development of the finds is given by small lithic bladelets with lateral and terminal retouch which also occurred in France during the late Allerod and which became a dominant type the so-called Malaurie points during the Younger Dryas Thus for the Central Rhineland the Final Palaeolithic site of Bad Breisig is evidence for a rapid return and resumption of traditional behaviour patterns of Lateglacial hunter-gatherers after the devastating natural hazard of the Laacher See eruption


Avenida Vasco da Gama

Avenida Vasco da Gama is a street in the north central area of Povoa de Varzim Portugal It is one of the main avenues in the city with hotels banks sports areas bars and is the location in the city with most high-rises It runs from Avenida do Mar expansion of the avenue to A28 Motorway freeway and Rua Gomes de Amorim EN 13 National Highway to Avenida dos Banhos in the waterfront It has some of Povoa de Varzim's most famous landmarks such as Touro and Povoa de Varzim Bullring
History
In the waterfront area where Avenida Vasco da Gama now stands vestiges of a Roman fish factory and surrounding houses were found and was widely publicized as the Roman core of Povoa de Varzim Villa Euracini although currently historians and archaeologists place the core of the city in the Old Town Povoa de Varzim but it then proved that Povoa de Varzim was much older than it was thought in the early years of the 20th century
Modern development started early in the 20th century and before Avenida Vasco da Gama opened due to the north expansion of Avenida dos Banhos in an area called Largo Dr Jose Pontes The Velodromo cycle track opened in 1925 which was later transformed into Gomes de Amorim Stadium venue of Sporting Club da Povoa founded in 1916 and extinct in the 1940s Estadio do Varzim Sport Club was built in 1929 and the club exists since 1915 Gomes de Amorim stadium was later demolished and in its place the Povoa de Varzim swimming pool complex and Tennis court were built The Bullring opened in 1949
In 1950 an underdeveloped and serpent-shaped street already existed in the area of the avenue and in much of its extension coincided with modern Avenida Vasco da Gama In 1975 modern Vasco da Gama was already built and was planned to be the new city entry with venues in the north side and buildings already existed in the south side from the waterfront to the bullring and by Gomes de Amorim street and the avenue got its modern shape The high-rise urbanization of Vasco da Gama took place in the early 1980s and it was completely urbanized by 1986 excepting for a small north side area near the current Touro square as it was the location where itinerant circus were placed
Due to planned relocation of some sports venues to Povoa de Varzim City Park a plan named Plano de Pormenor da Zona E54 PPZE54 aiming for further development and underground parking was subject to public discussion and approved by the city hall in 2009
Urban morphology
Vasco da Gama avenue is a small avenue but holds several high-rise buildings Floor counting is not universal as the first floor is counted as R/C and some buildings have a non-residential attic often relegated from floor-counting Some of its high-rises include Cristal Mar 16 residential floors but 18 floors above ground Other high-rises include Eca de Queiroz with 18 residential floors Hotel Costa Verde 14 and according to the urbanization plan there are 10 high-rises with at least 11 residential floors in the avenue area alone not counting buildings that almost meet the cut and those in nearby streets which rely on Vasco da Gama for transportation such as Nova Povoa tower the tallest building of Povoa de Varzim accounted to have 28 residential floors and 30 floors above ground The avenue is considered too cramped for the buildings it serves


Milton Shapp presidential campaign 1976

The Milton Shapp presidential campaign of 1976 began when then-Governor of Pennsylvania Milton Shapp elected to seek the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States in the 1976 election Shapp had won reelection as Governor of Pennsylvania in the 1974 election?the first Pennsylvania Governor to be elected to a second four-year term following an amendment permitting this in 1967?and had hoped to translate his relative popularity in Pennsylvania into the groundwork of a presidential campaign
Shapp's campaign employed a strategy of garnering votes and delegates in the Northeastern United States to generate momentum to expand into a national campaign while generating more widespread support This strategy proved unsuccessful as indicated by low showings in early primaries both within the northeast and elsewhere Considered a long-shot for the nomination Shapp's campaign came to an end following his withdrawal after a poor showing in the Massachusetts and Florida primaries
Background
Shapp entered politics in 1960 as an active supporter of future President John F Kennedy's campaign during that year's election In correspondence with President Kennedy's brother Robert he played a role in the creation of the Peace Corps and served as an adviser in that organization during the Kennedy administration Following his service in the Peace Corps Shapp mounted his first campaign for the Governorship of Pennsylvania in the 1966 election Running as the anti-political machine candidate Shapp defeated the machine-endorsed candidate and future Governor Robert P Casey in the Democratic primary He went on to lose the general election to Republican Raymond P Shafer
Shapp again sought the Governorship in the 1970 election in which incumbent Governor Shafer was not a candidate for reelection having been barred from running since he was elected prior to the 1967 amendment He again defeated Bob Casey for the Democratic nomination but this time was victorious in the general election He defeated Shafer's Lieutenant Governor Republican Raymond J Broderick and entered office in January 1971 Having gained a reputation as a populist and a consumer-advocate Shapp won re-election in the 1974 election defeating Republican Andrew L Lewis Jr
Campaign highlights
After expressing in mid-1975 a vested interest in and an intention to run in the 1976 election Shapp announced his candidacy for the Presidency of the United States on September 25 1975 in Washington D.C His campaign adopted a strategy of focusing efforts on garnering votes in the Northeastern United States announcing he would compete in primary contests in Massachusetts New Jersey New York and Pennsylvania despite skipping the New Hampshire primary From the beginning of the campaign Shapp had difficulty extending his appeal from the northeastern states At a Democratic convention in Florida in November 1975 Shapp finished second out of ten candidates in a straw poll behind former Georgia Governor and eventual winner Jimmy Carter the only other candidate to make an appearance at the convention Shapp entered the campaign relatively late and as a result had less time to organize in the primary states Although he did not expect to win the Florida primary he stated that he would be satisfied with a showing of 10 to 15 percent in order to prove he had extended his appeal from the northeast and had become a candidate with national appeal
Despite Shapp's attempts to expand his appeal beyond Pennsylvania and the northeast he did not have success in the primaries He finished with three percent of the vote in the Massachusetts primary on March 2 earning one delegate After the poor showing in Massachusetts expectations were lowered for the Florida primary by Shapp and his campaign staff who expressed confidence in his ability to garner at least seven percent of the vote there The March 9 Florida primary proved to be another disappointment just over two percent of voters cast their ballots for Shapp who did not earn any delegates and finished slightly behind the uncommitted option on the ballot
Shapp's finishes in Massachusetts and Florida prompted him to reconsider his campaign for the Presidency In the days following the Florida primary Shapp discussed his future with members of his campaign staff and family as well as his supporters after which he decided to end his campaign for the Democratic nomination on March 11 On the following day March 12 Shapp formally announced his withdrawal from the Presidential race but did not immediately endorse one of his former competitors and stated that he would return to Harrisburg Pennsylvania to serve the remainder of his term as Governor and concentrate his efforts on the passage of the state budget In his withdrawal Shapp stated that he did not have the time or money necessary to continue his campaign He was the fourth candidate to withdraw from the Democratic primary race
Aftermath
After his withdrawal Shapp became a speculated candidate for a Cabinet post or another appointment in a potential administration of one of his former competitors Although Shapp stated that he was not seeking an appointment he did not specify whether he would accept or decline one if offered and fellow Democratic Presidential candidate Mo Udall expressed an openness to considering Shapp for a Cabinet appointment should he be elected President Instead Jimmy Carter eventually won the Democratic nomination and went on to defeat incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the November general election Shapp did not receive an appointment in the Carter administration
In May 1977 the Federal Election Commission FEC determined that Shapp was not eligible for federal public financing of his Presidential campaign and he was subsequently ordered to repay the he had received in federal funds The FEC ruled that the Shapp campaign had improperly reported contributions from five states of the twenty state minimum requirement for federal funding
Following the 1976 campaign Shapp returned to Pennsylvania to serve the remainder of his second term as Governor Although unsuccessful in running for President Shapp is credited with creating the Pennsylvania Department of Aging overseeing the passage of legislation requiring financial disclosure by Pennsylvania government officials and implementing reforms to the Pennsylvania Turnpike Shapp served as Governor until the inauguration of his successor Republican Dick Thornburgh in 1979 He died on November 24 1994 at age 82

Bromopyrogallol red

Bromopyrogallol red is frequently used in analytical chemistry as a reagent for spectrophometric analysis and as an complexometric indicator
Uses behaviors and properties
Bromopyrogallol red is commonly used in analytical chemistry as a spectrophotometric reagent and complexometric indicator When metal ion complexation reactions are carried out in the presence of quaternary ammonium salts the analytical possibilities with bromopyrogallol red are even greater Doing this also increases the color contrast and sensitivity of many elements for analysis In addition bromopyrogallol red can also be widely used as a metallochromic indicator Bromopyrogallol red has been used as a complexometric indicator for determination of Bi Cd Co Mg and Mn
Bromopyrogallol red is protonized in 1 M H2S4 solution and changes gradually to its ionized forms in alkaline solution In its neutral form bromopyrogallol red is bipolar ion containing a protonized carbonyl group as well as a dissociated sulfonate group Through testing at isobestic points it has been determined that bromopyrogallol red is a stronger acid than Pyrogallol Red In the presence of ammonia salts the bathochromic shifts increase The hydrophillic group on the ammonia salts also change the dissociation of the reagent to be used with bromopyrogallol red to a more acidic region
Bromopyrogallol red is also a triphenylmethane indictor An efficient purification can be obtained by chromatographic separation on a polyamide column prewashed with HCl Purity can then be checked by thin layer chromatography on a microcrystalline cellulose plate using either a system of butanol-acetic acid-water n-propanol - water or methanol-water Another use of Bromopyrogallol red is as an idicator for titrations with Cd pH 9.3 Mg pH 10 Mn pH10 and lanthanidoes pH 7 It also commonly used in back-titrations with Co Cu Ga Pb and Th It is usually used as a 0.05% solution in 50% ethanol when used as an indicator
In pharmacy bromopyrogallol red serves to bind proteins together It is used in 30-100 É mol/L concentrations It has been used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and p50 and title comp preincubated in assay buffer pH 7.5 room temp 5 min
Applications and research
Bromopyrogallol red has numerous applications with analytical chemistry such as spectrophotometric analysis and as a complexometric indicator
Spectrophotometric determination
By reacting the bromopyrogallol red with niobium(V in a tartrate medium at pH 6.0 an intense blue coloured 3:1 reagent was formed The sensitivity and conditional selectivity of bromopyrogallol red was also studied and results show that trace amounts of silver can be detected from the formation of a ternary complex between l,lO-phenanthroline bromopyrogallol Red and silver ion This is because of the two adjacent phenol groups in the structure of bromopyrogallol red
Bromopyrogallol red is used as indicating reagent for rare earth type clement5 It is chosen under the spectrophotometric determination method and used as indicator because the reagent forms different visible color Bromopyrogallol red forms blue to violet-blue complexes with Yttrium and Cerium It also has shows orange yellow in strong acid solution claret red in nearly neutral solution and blue in alkaline solution
Increased cell efficiency
By forming complex ion of bromopyrogallol red and iron(II compounds the efficiency of cell can be increased The lowest transition in the bromopyrogallol have a MLCT character which greatly increase the electron sensitivity in Iron II and thus the complexation of bromopyrogallol ligand with iron(II bisoxalato moiety was determined to increase the cell efficiency to a higher level
Hydrogen donor substrate for peroxidase
Bromopyrogallol red is designed to be a hydrogen donor for peroxidase Instead of an indicator bromopyrogallol red is now used as a catalyst and its reaction rate depends upon enzyme and substrate concentrations With the HRP-H2O2-BPR catalytic system the bromopyrogallol red is determined to be an efficient reagent and quantitation of HRP can be performed It will increase the reaction rate of H2O2 and glucose
Characterization
Bromopyrogallol red is a green to dark brown crystalline powder It produces a spectrum in dimethyl sulfoxide with an absorption maxima at 412 and 523?nm When used with an ethanol solvent the spectrum ranges from 400-540?nm in H2O it is 360-530?nm and in 1,4-dioxane and water with a ratio of 4:2 gives an absorption maxima at 470?nm It is soluble in water and can be stored at 4?ÅãC
Safety
As a complexometric indicator for determination of Bi Cd Co Mg Mn and rare earths,Bromopyrogallol red is not classified as harmful by ingestion Direct contact with eye may cause tearing or conjunctive redness It will also cause skin irritation the entry of bromopyrogallol red into the blood stream may produce systemic injury The material should also avoid contamination with oxidizing agents like nitrates oxidizing acids,chlorine bleaches pool chlorine etc


Wang Du

Wang Du â§ìs d March 26 929 ne Liu Yunlang ó´â_òY was a warlord during the early Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period of China as the military governor Jiedushi of Yiwu Circuit ã`ïê headquartered in modern Baoding Hebei He seized control of Yiwu from his adoptive father Wang Chuzhi in a coup and subsequently ruled it semi-independently as a vassal of Jin and Jin's successor state Later Tang In 928 then-reigning Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang believing that Wang was about to openly rebel ordered a general campaign against him and after a lengthy siege Wang killed himself and his family by self-immolation as his capital was falling
Background
It is not known exactly when Wang Du was born ? although subsequent events cast a timeframe as to when his birth might have been and it was clearly late in the Tang Dynasty He was initially born in a household in Xingyi ?óW in modern Shijiazhuang Hebei with the name of Liu Yunlang At one point he was taken by the sorcerer Li Yingzhi óõú‰îV and raised by Li as his child At one point Li became acquainted with Wang Chuzhi ? although it is not known whether Wang Chuzhi was then still an officer under his brother Wang Chucun or Wang Chucun's son and successor Wang Gao or whether he was already military governor after succeeding Wang Gao ? and healed Wang Chuzhi of an illness As a result Wang Chuzhi believed that Li had supernatural powers and came to trust him At that time Wang Chuzhi did not yet have a son and Li gave Liu Yunlang to him to be his child stating to him This boy has an honored appearance Wang agreed to take the boy as a son renaming him Wang Du
Due to Wang Chuzhi's trust in Li apparently after he became military governor in 900 he entrusted many military decisions to Li causing resentment among his officers There was a time when an army of neighboring Lulong Circuit ·∏ó¥ headquartered in modern Beijing was passing through Yiwu and Wang concerned that Lulong forces might launch a surprise attack mobilized his troops to prepare The officers took this chance to surround his mansion and kill Li They then also tried to force Wang to kill Wang Du as well Wang Chuzhi insisted on not doing so and the officers relented The next day Wang Chuzhi held a feast for them to comfort them but secretly recorded the names of all who attended Over the next 20 years he gradually found excuses to kill them one by one
Wang Chuzhi did have biological sons later but he did not favor them instead favoring Wang Du who as he grew was good at flattering his father and treachery He established a new army and put Wang Du in charge of it Among Wang Chuzhi's biological sons apparently the oldest one was Wang Yu â§àË born of a concubine Unhappy that Wang Chuzhi did not favor him he fled to Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit âÕìå headquartered in modern Taiyuan Shanxi and Li Keyong gave him a daughter in marriage eventually promoting him to be the military prefect ö£ó˚ég Tuanlianshi of Xin Prefecture êVèB in modern Zhangjiakou Hebei As all of Wang Chuzhi's other sons were young Wang Chuzhi made Wang Du the deputy military governor and planned to pass the military governor office to him
As of 921 Tang had long fallen and Wang Chuzhi's Yiwu Circuit was aligned with Li Keyong's son and successor Li Cunxu the Prince of Jin in a long-term war with Tang's successor state Later Liang That year another ally of theirs Wang Rong the Prince of Zhao also known as Chengde Circuit ê¨˙∫ headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang was killed in a coup by his adoptive son Zhang Wenli known as Wang Deming while Wang Rong's adoptive son and Li declared a general campaign against Zhang Wang Chuzhi believing that over the late Tang decades Yiwu and Chengde had been geographically reliant on each other for defense and that if Li took control of Chengde directly Yiwu would be isolated opposed the campaign Li however sent a response stating that because of Zhang's great crimes he could not be spared Wang apprehensive of the consequences decided to secretly contact Wang Yu asking him to entice Khitan Empire's Emperor Taizu to invade to divert Jin troops Wang Yu agreed but extracted a promise from Wang Chuzhi that he not Wang Du would become Wang Chuzhi's heir
The officers at Wang Chuzhi's own headquarters however did not want to invite Khitan troops and Wang Du was also concerned that Wang Yu would take over his position He thus secretly plotted with his secretary He Zhaoxun òaè∫åP to seize Wang Chuzhi They took an opportunity to act when Wang Chuzhi welcomed Zhang's emissary to Yiwu and feasted with the emissary As Wang Chuzhi was returning to headquarters after the feast Wang Du had several hundred new army soldiers hidden around the mansion and seized Wang Chuzhi He put Wang Chuzhi under house arrest at his western mansion and slaughtered Wang Chuzhi's male descendants and close associates He declared himself acting military governor and reported what happened to Li Cunxu Li Cunxu officially sanctioned him as acting military governor Only Wang Chuzhi's young son Wang Wei â§à– escaped the slaughter and fled to Khitan
As military governor
During Jin
Shortly after Li Cunxu put Chengde's capital Zhen Prefecture í¡èB under siege Wang Yu persuaded Liao's Emperor Taizu to aid the Chengde rebels and Emperor Taizu agreed In winter 921 he marched through Lulong and then attacked Yiwu's capital Ding Prefecture íËèB Wang Du sought emergency aid from Li Li headed for Ding to aid Wang Du
Meanwhile in spring 922 while under attack Wang Du went to visit Wang Chuzhi at his western mansion apparently trying to maintain a resemblance of a father-son relationship Wang Chuzhi however swung his fists at Wang Du's chest cursing Rebellious bandit When did I ever mistreat you As he was unarmed he also tried to bite at Wang Du's nose Wang Du barely escaped from Wang Chuzhi's grasp Shortly after Wang Chuzhi either died in anger or was killed by Wang Du
As Li's relief force approached Ding Prefecture Emperor Taizu advanced to Xinle êVûŸ in modern Shijiazhuang to confront him At a battle there however he was defeated by Li and forced wo withdraw lifting the siege on Ding in the process Wang Du went out of the city to personally welcome Li and held a feast for him He also asked to give his teenage daughter in marriage to Li's son Li Jiji which Li Cunxu agreed to However it is unclear whether the marriage ever actually took place After this meeting it was said that Li treated him well and whatever requests he made were approved
During Emperor Zhuangzong's reign as emperor
In 923 Li Cunxu declared himself the emperor of a new Later Tang as Emperor Zhuangzong claiming to be the legitimate successor to Tang He soon destroyed Later Liang and took over its territory Wang Du continued to serve Emperor Zhuangzong During Emperor Zhuangzong's reign Wang continued to act as a semi-independent warlord commissioning the prefects for the two subordinate prefectures Qi åVèB and Yi à’èB both in modern Baoding by himself not submitting census counts to the imperial government and keeping the tax revenues for his own army without submitting them to the imperial government In 925 when Emperor Zhuangzong visited Yedu ?ìs in modern Handan Hebei Wang went to Yedu to pay homage to him and Emperor Zhuangzong held grand feasts in his honor It was for the purpose of opening a polo field for Emperor Zhuangzong to welcome Wang at that Emperor Zhuangzong destroyed an altar that he had initially received the imperial title in 923 ? an act that the deputy defender of Yedu Zhang Xian í£åõ considered a sign of misfortune since it showed a lack of gratitude for the Mandate of Heaven
During Emperor Mingzong's reign
ngIn 926 Emperor Zhuangzong was killed in a mutiny at then-capital Luoyang Soon his adoptive brother the general Li Siyuan who had led a separate mutiny arrived at Luoyang and claimed imperial title as Emperor Mingzong Emperor Mingzong bestowed the honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling íÜèëóﬂ on Wang Du but was said to despise Wang because of what Wang had done to his father Another source of the friction between the imperial government and Yiwu developed over the fact that Emperor Mingzong's chief of staff An Chonghui wanted to show imperial strength and was not as willing to allow Yiwu to retain its revenues Further due to the incessant Khitan attacks the Later Tang imperial government was often sending armies to the region of Lulong and Yiwu and Wang feared that they actually intended to attack him Both sides became suspicious of each other
Wang became apprehensive that Emperor Mingzong might try to move him from Yiwu to another circuit and therefore consulted He Zhaoxun He Zhaoxun suggested finding ways to alienate other military governors so that he could protect himself Wang therefore tried a number of ways to ally with other military governors ? including trying to enter a marriage alliance with Zhao Dejun the military governor of Lulong asking to become blood brothers with Wang Jianli the military governor of Chengde who had an enmity with An sending secret letters encased in wax to the military governors of Pinglu ïΩ·∏ headquartered in modern Weifang Shandong Huo Yanwei Zhongwu íâïê headquartered in modern Xuchang Henan Fang Zhiwen ñ[ím? Zhaoyi è∫ã` headquartered in modern Changzhi Shanxi Mao Zhang ñ—‡ˆ Xichuan êºêÏ headquartered in modern Chengdu Sichuan Meng Zhixiang and Dongchuan ìåêÏ headquartered in modern Mianyang Sichuan Dong Zhang trying to alienate them from the imperial government and trying to entice the general Wang Yanqiu the military governor of Guide Circuit üd˙∫ headquartered in modern Shangqiu Henan who was then commanding the imperial defense against Khitan incursions When Wang Yanqiu refused his overtures he tried to bribe Wang Yanqiu's subordinates into assassinating Wang Yanqiu The attempt failed and Wang Yanqiu reported this to Emperor Mingzong accusing Wang Du of rebellion
In summer 928 Emperor Mingzong ordered a general campaign against Wang Du putting Wang Yanqiu in overall command of the operations assisted by An Shentong à¿êRí  and Zhang Qianzhao í£Âiè∫ Wang Yanqiu quickly advanced to Ding Prefecture and put it under siege but the Khitan general the Xi chieftain Tunei ì√ÈN quickly arrived to aid Wang Du They attacked Wang Yanqiu but Wang Yanqiu repelled their attack forcing them to withdraw within the Ding city walls Wang Yanqiu then captured Ding's western city However the main city's walls were secure and difficult to attack so Wang Yanqiu relaxed his attack while building a temporary Yiwu headquarters as Emperor Mingzong put him temporarily in charge of Yiwu collecting the taxes from the three prefectures Ding Qi and Yi to supply his troops
Shortly after another Khitan army arrived and Wang Yanqiu and Zhang Yanlang withdrew some distance away from Ding Wang Du and Tunei took the opportunity to chase them to Quyang ã»óz in modern Baoding but fell into a trap laid by Wang Yanqiu and were defeated with heavy casualties forcing them to flee back to Ding Wang Yanqiu also defeated another subsequent wave of Khitan reinforcements and then put Ding under siege again With Khitan forces discouraged by their defeat at Wang Yanqiu's hands Ding's situation became difficult As a desperate measure Wang welcomed one Li Jitao óõ„ãì© ? a commoner boy that Emperor Zhuangzong had taken on one of his campaigns and adopted as his own son but whom Emperor Mingzong had sent out of the palace when he took the throne ? to Ding and had him put on the emperor's yellow robe and sit on the city wall stating to Wang Yanqiu This is the son of Emperor Zhuangzong who is now to be emperor You Lord had received the graces from the deceased emperor How can you not think of him Wang Yanqiu however pointed out that this was a useless trick and did not relent on his attack
However Wang Du was for months effective at holding Ding's defenses He also kept close watch on his officers and any officer who were about to defect to the imperial forces would be killed Emperor Mingzong sent messengers to push Wang Yanqiu into attacking more directly but Wang Yanqiu showed the secureness of the defenses to the imperial messengers and insisted that it was better to keep the city under siege and then wait for it to collapse on its own Emperor Mingzong agreed In spring 929 Wang Du and Tunei tried to fight their way out of the siege but could not Shortly after Wang Du's officer Ma Rangneng înÊ®î\ opened up the city gates to let the imperial forces in Wang Du and his family committed suicide by fire Wang Du had maintained an extensive collection of books which he collected by sending messengers to buy up rare books at the time that Zhang Wenli's son Zhang Chujin was defeated at Chengde and when Later Liang was conquered In his suicide the book collection was also destroyed Four of his sons and one of his brothers presumably from the Liu line were captured along with Tunei and presented to Emperor Mingzong


Birth control in Africa

Most of the countries with the lowest rates of contraceptive use highest maternal infant and child mortality rates and highest fertility rates are in Africa
Approximately 30% of all women use birth control although over half of all African women would like to use birth control if it were available The main problems that prevent access to and use of birth control are unavailability poor health care services spousal disapproval religious concerns and misinformation about the effects of birth control The most available type of birth control is condoms There is evidence that increased use of family planning methods decreases maternal and infant mortality rates improves quality of life for mothers and stimulates economic development
Prevalence
In Africa 53% of women of reproductive age have an unmet need for modern contraception Rwanda and Uganda have the highest unmet need for contraception rates
Namibia with a contraception use rate of 46% in 2006-07 has one of the highest rates in Africa while Senegal with a rate of 8.7% in 2005 has one of the lowest rates In Sub-Saharan Africa extreme poverty lack of access to birth control and restrictive abortion laws cause about 3% of women to have unsafe abortions South Africa Botswana and Zimbabwe have successful family planning programs but other central and southern African countries continue to encounter difficulties in achieving higher contraceptive prevalence and lower fertility rates Contraceptive use among women in Sub-Saharan Africa has risen from about 5% in 1991 to about 30% in 2006 Socioeconomic class constitutes an inequity in relation to mortality and morbidity
The disparity between the rich and poor in the use of contraception has remained the same despite overall improvements in socioeconomic status and expansion of family planning services
Factors affecting prevalence
A growing population limited access to contraception cultural and religious opposition poor quality of available services gender based barriers and spousal disapproval all contribute to the high unmet need for contraception in Africa In Eastern Africa the unmet need is attributed to socioeconomic variables the family planning program environment and reproductive behavior models
Gyimah attributes the higher fertility rates of Sub Saharan African countries compared to other developing countries to Ågthe inter-related factors of early childbearing high infant mortality low education and contraceptive use and persistence of high fertility-sustaining social customs.Åh
Some of the factors identified that prevented use of modern birth control methods in a 2008 study in Nigeria were Ågperceived negative health reaction fear of unknown effects cost spouseÅfs disapproval religious belief and inadequate information.Åh
Until the 1990s contraception and family planning were associated with fears of eugenic ideology and population control which narrowed the scope of behavior-change communication and distribution of contraceptive devices
Recently a new approach of promoting spousal discussion of contraception has been proposed as a policy strategy to narrow the gender gap in partners fertility intentions in developing countries Men are usually the decision makers on birth control use and therefore should be the targeted audience of educational campaigns Discussion between spouses is expected to increase contraceptive use because one reason women cite for not using contraception is their husband's disapproval despite never having discussed family planning with their husbands A 2013 study in Kenya and Zambia shows a correlation between ante-natal care use and post-partum contraceptive use which suggests that contraceptive use could be increased by promoting ante-natal care services A 1996 study in Zambia again cites the importance of educating both men and women and states that single mothers and teenagers should be the primary focus of birth control education Of the 376 women recruited after giving birth at a hospital 34% had previously used family planning and 64% had used family planning a year after giving birth Of the women who did not use family planning 39% cited spousal disapproval as the reason 84% of single mothers had never used family planning before and 56% of teenagers did not know anything about family planning A 1996 Kenyan study suggests modern contraception education that promotes quality of life over traditional reproductive practices
Methods
In most African countries only a few types of birth control are offered which makes finding a method that fits a couple's reproductive needs difficult Many African countries had low access scores on almost every method In the 1999 ratings for 88 countries 73% of countries offered condoms to at least half their population 65% of countries offered the pill 54% offered IUDs 42% offered female sterilization and 26% offered male sterilization Low levels of condom use are cause for concern particularly in the context of generalized epidemics in Sub-Saharan Africa The usage rate for injectable contraceptives increased from 2% to 8% and from 8% to 26% in Sub-Saharan Africa while the usage rate for condoms was 5?7% The least used method of contraception is male sterilization with a usage rate of less than 3% 6?20% of women in Sub-Saharan Africa used injectable contraceptives covertly a practice more common in areas where contraceptive prevalence was low particularly rural areas
Effects
Use of modern birth control methods has been shown to decrease female fertility rate in Sub-Saharan Africa
Health
Africa has the highest maternal death rate which measures the death rate of women due to pregnancy and childbirth The maternal mortality ratio in Sub Saharan Africa is 1,006 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births An article by Baggaley et al suggests that increasing access to safe abortion would reduce maternal mortality due to unsafe abortions in Ethiopia and Tanzania Alvergne et al argue in ÅgFertility parental investment and the early adoption of modern contraception in rural EthiopiaÅh that an increase in usage of family planning increases birth spacing which consequently decreases infant mortality although it had no observed effect on overall child mortality possibly due to a recent overall decrease childhood death rates among both contraception users and nonusers
Additionally increasing condom use in Africa would decrease rates of HIV transmission
Social
According to Gyimah women who have their first child at a younger age are less likely to finish school and will be more limited to low paying career options Research suggests that desire to continue with their education is one of the largest reasons that women use birth control and terminate pregnancies Since birth control is not widely available beginning a family at a young age is additionally correlated with a higher overall fertility rate Alvergne suggests that another benefit of longer birth intervals due to contraception use is an increase in parental investment and proportion of resources dedicated to each child Two of the most prevalent reasons for married women to use birth control are to plan birth spacing and postpone pregnancies in order to achieve their desired family size
According to Gyimah fertility rates are declining in some African countries particularly Kenya Botswana Zimbabwe and Ghana The decrease in fertility rates in Ghana is largely attributed to investment in education that has caused an increase in age at first birth and improved job opportunities for women
Economic
Increased use of family planning leads to economic development because women are more likely to work and their children are more likely to be healthy and educated
There is an estimated 140-600% return on investment in family planning methods due to health care savings and economic development The Economic Case for Birth Control published in 1967 argues that decreasing the birth rate in countries with high fertility levels is crucial to economic growth and that one dollar useed to slow population growth can be 100 times more effective in raising income per head than one dollar to expand output
Since the majority of African countries have high fertility rates relative to the rest of the world it is clear that most African countries have not undergone a demographic transition In other parts of the world there is evidence that economic growth increases after a country undergoes demographic transition This is due to more women working greater parental investment in children in terms of education and attention and longer more productive working life due to health improvements Although other improvements in public health are necessary to fully undergo a demographic transition it can not occur without family planning It is unclear however how exactly the demographic transition will affect society in sub-Saharan Africa
An economic downside to using birth control to limit fertility is the possibility that parents will not having enough successful living offspring to support them financially in old age This is a significant concern among parents
Society and Culture
Public Policy
The United Nations created the Every Woman Every Child initiative to assess the progress toward meeting women's contraceptive needs and modern family planning services These initiatives have set their goals in terms of expected increases in the number of users of modern methods because this is a direct indicator that typically increases in response to interventions The London Summit on Family Planning is attempting to make modern contraceptive services accessible to an additional 120 million women in the world's poorest 69 countries by the year 2020 The Summit wants to eradicate discrimination or coercion against girls who seek contraceptives
One of the Millennium Development Goals which was established in 2000 by 193 United Nations member states and 23 international organizations is improving maternal health The maternal mortality ratio in developing regions is still 15 times higher than in the developed regions The maternal health initiative calls for countries to reduce their maternal mortality rate by three quarters by 2015 Eritrea is one of the four African countries on track to achieve Millennium Development Goals which would be a rate of less than 350 deaths per 100,000 births
Cultural Attitudes
In the traditional Northern Ghana society payment of bridewealth in cows and sheep signifies the wife's obligation to bear children This deeply ingrained expectation about a womanÅfs duty to reproduce creates apprehension in men that their wife or wives may be unfaithful if they used contraception Arranged marriages which generally occur at a young age limit female autonomy and therefore often result in a culture in which females do not feel in control of their own reproductive health According to a 1987 study by Caldwell large families are seen as socially favorable and infertility is viewed negatively causing women to use birth control mainly to increase birth intervals instead of limiting family size The possibility that women may act independently is also regarded as a threat to the strong patriarchal tradition Physical abuse and repraisals from the extended family pose substantial threats to women Violence against women was considered justified by 51% of female and 43% of male respondents if the wife used a contraceptive method without the husband's knowledge Women feared that their husband's disapproval of family planning could lead to withholding of affection or sex or even divorce
In areas with communal grazing areas or Ågtribal tenure,Åh large families are desirable because more children means more productive capability and therefore higher status and more wealth for the father according to Boserup Additionally having more children decreases the motherÅfs workload However most people in Africa today live in urban areas or agricultural communities with private land ownership In these communities having a family that is larger than one can support is viewed negatively by the rest of society Private landowners do not need to rely on financial support from children in old age or in crises because they can sell their land Despite these changes however Boserup suggests that large families are still seen as symbols of wealth and higher social status by men
In the cities of Nairobi and Bungoma in Kenya major barriers to contraceptive use included lack of agreement on contraceptive use and on reproductive intentions.There were also gaps in knowledge on contraceptive methods fears from rumors misconceptions about specific methods perceived undesirable effects and availability and poor quality of services in the areas studied About 33% of wives in Nairobi and 50% in Bungoma desired no more children however husbands desired about four or more children than wives wanted Lack of couple agreement and communication were primary reasons for nonuse Compared to Ghana the man is considered the decision maker.The husband has a greater desire for more children preferably sons because they are able to provide financial security for their parents
In other Sub-Saharan African cultures spousal discussion of sexual matters is discouraged Friends of family and in-laws are used between partners in order for them to exchange ideas and issues pertaining to this matter Couples in these cultures may use other forms of communication such as specific music wearing specific waist beads acting a certain way and preparing of favorite meals to convey unambiguous sex-related messages to each other In the case of contraception a man's use of a contraceptive may itself be a nonverbal indicator of approval Therefore discussion may improve knowledge of family planning attitudes only when it is more efficient than or augments the effectiveness of other forms of communication


History of the National Assembly of Pakistan

The National Assembly is the lower house of the bicameral Majlis-e-Shura which also comprises the President of Pakistan and Senate upper house The National Assembly and the Senate both convene at Parliament House in Islamabad The National Assembly is a democratically elected body consisting of a total of 342 members who are referred to as Members of the National Assembly MNAs of which 272 are directly elected members and 70 reserved seats for women and religious minorities A political party must secure 172 seats to obtain and preserve a majority
1st National Assembly
The foremost task before the first Constituent Assembly is of framing the Constitution for the nation On 7 March 1949 the Objectives Resolution which now serves as the grund norm of Pakistan was introduced by the first Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan and later adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 12 March 1949 On the same day a Basic Principles Committee with 24 members was formed to prepare a draft Constitution on the basis of the Objectives Resolution On 16 October 1951 Prime Minister Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan mover of the Objective Resolution was assassinated and Khawaja Nazimuddin took over as the Prime Minister on 17 October 1951 The final draft of the Constitution was prepared in 1954 By that time Muhammad Ali Bogra had taken over as the Prime Minister However just before the draft could be placed in the House for approval the Assembly was dissolved by the then Governor General Ghulam Muhammad on 24th October1954 The Prime Minister was however not dismissed and was asked to run the administration with a reconstituted Cabinet until such time as the elections were held Maulvi Tamizuddin President of the Assembly challenged the dissolution in the Sindh Chief Court and won the case The Government in return went to the Federal Court where the famous judgment was given by the then Chief Justice Muhammad Munir according to which Maulvi Tamizuddin lost the case
2nd National Assembly
The second National Assembly was known as the 2nd Constituent Assembly of Pakistan It was created on 28 May 1955 under Governor General's Order No.12 of 1955 The Electoral College for this Assembly was the Provincial Assemblies of respective Provinces The strength of this Assembly was 80 Members half each from East Pakistan and West Pakistan One of the major decisions taken by this Assembly was the establishment of West Pakistan One Unit with the aim to create parity between the two wings East and West Pakistan This Assembly also achieved its target by giving the first Constitution to the nation i.e the Constitution of Pakistan 1956 Choudhary Muhammad Ali was the Prime Minister at that time Under this Constitution Pakistan became an Islamic Republic hence 23 March became our Republic day It was the same day in 1940 that the historic Pakistan Resolution was adopted at Minto Park Lahore 1959,On 5 March 1956 Major General Sikandar Mirza became the first elected President of Pakistan President Sikandar Mirza abrogated the Constitution dissolved the National and Provincial Assemblies and declared Martial Law on 7 October 1958 He appointed General Muhammad Ayub Khan Commander-in-Chief of the Army as the Chief Martial Law Administrator 27 October 1958 General Muhammad Ayub Khan took over as a second President of Pakistan A new Constitution was framed and given to the nation on 1 March 1962
3rd National Assembly
General elections under the new Constitution were held on 28 March 1962 and elections to the special seats reserved for women were held on 29 May 1962 The first session of the third National Assembly was held on 8 June 1962 at Ayub Hall Rawalpindi
4th National Assembly
On 25 March 1969 the second Martial law was imposed and General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan took over as the President of Pakistan and Chief Martial Law Administrator He later issued a Legal Framework Order LFO under which the first ever general elections were held on 7 December 1970 This was the first Assembly elected on the adult franchise and population basis It consist of 313 members 169 from East Pakistan and 144 from West Pakistan including 13 reserved seats for women 6 were from West Pakistan and 7 from East Pakistan Soon after the elections due to grave political differences the Province of East Pakistan seceded from West Pakistan and became Bangladesh On 20 December 1971 Mr Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto took over as the President of Pakistan as well as the first civil Chief Martial Law Administrator
The first session of the National Assembly due to the delay caused by the separation of East Pakistan was held on 14thApril 1972 at the State Bank Building Islamabad in which all 144 Members from West Pakistan and two from former East Pakistan Mr Noor-ul-Amin and Raja Tridev Roy who had chosen to join Pakistan participated On 17 April 1972 an Interim Constitution was adopted by the National Assembly which provided for a Presidential form of Government Under this Constitution the National Assembly was not to be dissolved earlier than 14 August 1973 The Interim Constitution dealt in detail with the distribution of powers between the Centre and the Provinces The Assembly also formed a Constitution Committee on 17 April 1972 to prepare the first draft for framing a Constitution The report of the Committee was presented with a draft Constitution on 31 December 1972 It was unanimously passed by the Assembly in its session on 10 April 1973 and was authenticated by the President on 12 April 1973 This Constitution called the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 was promulgated on 14 August 1973 On the same day Mr Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto took oath as the Prime Minister while Mr Fazal Illahi Choudhary took oath as the President of Pakistan
From 1947 to 1973 the country had a unicameral system of legislature Under the 1973 Constitution Pakistan adopted bicameral system at the centre called The Parliament composing the President the National Assembly and The Senate Originally the general seats of the National Assembly were 200 with additional 10 seats reserved for women bringing the total strength to 210 The newly created Upper House i.e the Senate had 63 members Later in 1985 through a Presidential Order P.O No 14 of 1985 seven seats were added to the general seats and ten to the reserved seats for women in the National Assembly Ten seats were exclusively reserved for minorities to be filled through separate electorate system Thus the total strength of the lower house reached to 237 members Similarly the strength of Senate was also increased from 63 to 87

Aprilis

Aprilis or mensis Aprilis April was the fourth month of the ancient Roman calendar following Martius March and preceding Maius May On the oldest Roman calendar that had begun with March Aprilis was the second of ten months in the year April had 29 days on calendars of the Roman Republic with a day added to the month during the reform in the mid-40s BC that produced the Julian calendar
April was marked by a series of festivals devoted to aspects of rural life since it was a busy month for farmers As Rome became more urbanized the significance of some ceremonies expanded notably the Parilia an archaic pastoral festival celebrated as the birthday dies natalis or founding day of Rome The month was generally preoccupied with deities who were female or ambiguous in gender opening with the Feast of Venus on the Kalends
Name of the month
The Romans thought that the name Aprilis derived from aperio aperire apertus a verb meaning to open The Fasti Praenestini offered the expanded explanation that fruits and flowers and animals and seas and lands do open
Some antiquarians as well as Ovid in his poem on the Roman calendar provide an alternate derivation from Aphrodite the Greek counterpart of Venus whose festival began the month Apru might be derived from the conjectured Etruscan form of the name which would be Aprodita but among the Etruscans the month was called Cabreas Some modern linguists derive Aprilis from Etruscan Ampile or Amphile based on a medieval gloss conjecturing an origin in the Thessalian month name Aphrios An Indo-European origin has also been proposed related to Sanskrit aparah and Latin alter the other of two referring to its original position as the second month of the year Varro and Cincius both reject the connection of the name to Aphrodite and the common Roman derivation from aperio may be the correct one
In the latter years of Nero's reign the Senate briefly renamed April Neronius in his honor
In the agricultural year
The farmers almanacs menologia rustica concur that Venus?in Roman religion a goddess of gardens? was the tutelary deity of April and that sheep were to be purified oves lustrantur In his agricultural treatise Varro enumerates duties such as weeding crops breaking ground cutting willows fencing meadows and planting and pruning olives
The second half of April brought a series of festivals pertaining to farm life
Of these the Fordicidia and Robigalia are likely to have been of greatest antiquity William Warde Fowler whose early 20th-century work on Roman festivals remains a standard reference asserted that the Fordicidia was beyond doubt one of the oldest sacrificial rites in Roman religion The latter part of April was consumed by games ludi in honor of Ceres the grain goddess thought to have power over growth and the life cycle The end of the month brought the beginning of the games of Flora goddess of blooming plants and listed by Varro as one of the twelve principal agricultural deities
Dates
The Romans did not number days of a month sequentially from the 1st through the last day Instead they counted back from the three fixed points of the month the Nones 5th or 7th the Ides 13th or 15th and the Kalends 1st of the following month The Nones of April was the 5th and the Ides the 13th The last day of April was the pridie Kalendas Maias day before the Kalends of May Roman counting was inclusive April 9 was ante diem V Id?s Aprilis the 5th day before the Ides of April usually abbreviated a.d V Id Apr or with the a.d omitted altogether April 23 was IX Kal Mai the 9th day before the Kalends of May on the Julian calendar VIII Kal Mai on the pre-Julian calendar
On the calendar of the Roman Republic and early Principate each day was marked with a letter to denote its religiously lawful status In April these were
By the late 2nd century AD extant calendars no longer show days marked with these letters probably in part as a result of calendar reforms undertaken by Marcus Aurelius Days were also marked with nundinal letters in cycles of A B C D E F G H to mark the market week these are omitted in the table below
A dies natalis was an anniversary such as a temple founding or rededication sometimes thought of as the birthday of a deity During the Imperial period some of the traditional festivals localized at Rome became less important and the birthdays and anniversaries of the emperor and his family gained prominence as Roman holidays On the calendar of military religious observances known as the Feriale Duranum sacrifices pertaining to Imperial cult outnumber the older festivals After the mid-1st century AD a number of dates are added to calendars for spectacles and games ludi held in honor of various deities in the venue called a circus ludi circenses Festivals marked in large letters on extant fasti represented by festival names in all capital letters on the table are thought to have been the most ancient holidays becoming part of the calendar before 509 BC
Unless otherwise noted the dating and observances on the following table are from H.H Scullard Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic Cornell University Press 1981 pp.?96?115 After the Ides dates for the Julian calendar are given the pre-Julian date for festivals when April had one less day are noted parenthetically

Equine encephalosis virus

The Equine encephalosis virus EEV is a virus of the Orbivirus genus and a member of the Reoviridae family related to the African Horse Sickness Virus AHSV and the Blue Tongue Virus BTV
First described in South Africa over a hundred years ago by Arnold Theiler EEV is the causative agent of Equine Encephalosis EE an arthropod-borne disease transmitted by the Culicoides spp midges affecting all equids
Since then the disease has become both widespread and prevalent taking on epidemic proportions in certain parts of the country Serological studies estimated a presence of anti-EEV antibodies in over 75% of all South African horses
Prior to 2008 the Equine Encephalosis Virus had been identified and isolated only in South Africa where seven antigenetically distinct serotypes EEV1-7 have been characterised
In 2009 the outbreak of a febrile horse disease across Israel later diagnosed as EEV caused great concern primarily due to the similarity of EEV with the African Horse Sickness Virus one of the most devastating equine pathogens
Signs and symptoms
The name Equine Encephalosis is misleading as the disease is not primarily a neurological disorder Although the majority of infections result only in mild symptoms in more severe cases clinical signs include a short period typically two to five days of fluctuating fever accompanied by varying degrees of inappetence
Elevated heart and respiratory rates are also common and occasionally as a result of nasal congestion a red-brown discolouration of the mucous membranes may be observed
Although rare more severe symptoms may occur including facial swelling lips and eyelids respiratory distress and petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae
Pregnant mares may also abort during their first 5 months of gestation
Neurological signs are atypical symptoms but in certain cases hindquarter ataxia convulsions hyperexitability and depression have been reported
The mortality rate is normally low accounting for only 5% of infected animals
Structure and genome
The Equine Encephalosis Virus is an Orbivirus and as such encodes 4 non-structural and 7 structural proteins derived from 10 linear dsRNA genome segments
The smallest of those genome segments segment-10 encodes the NS3 protein which allows the release of the viral particles from the infected cell
The second largest of those segments in turn codes for one of the outer capsid proteins VP(2
By analogy with the Blue Tongue Virus both these proteins may then be used to determine the serotype of EEV of which seven have been identified to date
This is achieved by analysing the interaction between VP(2 and the antibodies generated by the host during infection
The sequence variation between the proteins is then associated with various viral serotypes
Epidemiology
First isolated in 1967 the Equine Encephalosis Virus appeared until recently to be unique to the South African equidae
As of 2008 however evidence seems to suggest the virus has circulated beyond southern Africa and outbreaks have been reported in a number of other countries including Israel Ethiopia Ghana and Gambia
Intriguingly Morocco remains free of the epidemic suggesting the Sahara desert may be acting as a natural barrier to the progression of the disease
Such a progression is of major concern to the worldwide livestock industry primarily due to the similarity between EEV and other more devastating equid pathogens such as the African Horse Sickness Virus
As with all vector-borne diseases EEV is not transmissible from host-to-host rather infection requires another intermediate organism that will transmit the pathogen In the case of the Equine Encephalosis virus the transmission occurs via the Culicoides midges during a blood meal
Several studies have shown that between 50 and 75% of South African equids notably horses donkeys and zebras are seropositive for EEV or have anti-EEV antibodies indicating a prior infection with serotype 1 being the most prevalent
Antibodies have also occasionally been reported in elephants
Treatment and prevention
Drug therapy
In the vast majority of cases c 90% the animal will recover without further complications and a course of anti-inflammatories or appetite stimulants may be administered Occasionally antibiotics are prescribed in order to prevent the appearance of secondary infections
Some equids show no symptoms at all but are biliary carriers
Although in this instance the animal is not in immediate danger it must be treated in order to prevent the reemergence of the virus were the immune system to be challenged by another disease simultaneously
Vector control
Due to the absence of an effective vaccine vector control remains one of the primary methods of prevention Control of the midges is usually only instigated for domesticated stabled horses and includes precautionary measures such as the limited use of lights at night as well as the use of fly repellents and fans


Viral phylodynamics

Viral phylodynamics is defined as the study of how epidemiological immunological and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape viral phylogenies
Since the coining of the term in 2004 research on viral phylodynamics has focused on transmission dynamics in an effort to shed light on how these dynamics impact viral genetic variation Transmission dynamics can be considered at the level of cells within an infected host individual hosts within a population or entire populations of hosts
Many viruses especially RNA viruses rapidly accumulate genetic variation because of short generation times and high mutation rates
Patterns of viral genetic variation are therefore heavily influenced by how quickly transmission occurs and by which entities transmit to one another
Patterns of viral genetic variation will also be affected by selection acting on viral phenotypes
Although viruses can differ with respect to many phenotypes phylodynamic studies have to date tended to focus on a limited number of viral phenotypes
These include virulence phenotypes phenotypes associated with viral transmissibility cell or tissue tropism phenotypes and antigenic phenotypes that can facilitate escape from host immunity
Due to the impact that transmission dynamics and selection can have on viral genetic variation viral phylogenies can therefore be used to investigate important epidemiological immunological and evolutionary processes such as epidemic spread spatio-temporal dynamics including metapopulation dynamics zoonotic transmission tissue tropism and antigenic drift
The quantitative investigation of these processes through the consideration of viral phylogenies is the central aim of viral phylodynamics
Sources of phylodynamic variation
In coining the term phylodynamics Grenfell and coauthors postulated that viral phylogenies are determined by a combination of immune selection changes in viral population size and spatial dynamics
Their study showcased three features of viral phylogenies which may serve as rules of thumb for identifying important epidemiological immunological and evolutionary processes influencing patterns of viral genetic variation
Although these three phylogenetic features are useful rules of thumb to identify epidemiological immunological and evolutionary processes that might be impacting viral genetic variation there is growing recognition that the mapping between process and phylogenetic pattern can be many-to-one For instance although ladder-like trees such as the one shown in figure 3A could reflect the presence of directional selection ladder-like trees could also reflect sequential genetic bottlenecks that might occur with rapid spatial spread as in the case of rabies virus Because of this many-to-one mapping between process and phylogenetic pattern research in the field of viral phylodynamics has sought to develop and apply quantitative methods to effectively infer process from reconstructed viral phylogenies see Methods The consideration of other data sources e.g incidence patterns may aid in distinguishing between competing phylodynamic hypotheses Combining disparate sources of data for phylodynamic analysis remains a major challenge in the field and is an active area of research
Applications
Viral origins
Phylodynamic models may aid in dating epidemic and pandemic origins
The rapid rate of evolution in viruses allows molecular clock models to be estimated from genetic sequences thus providing a per-year rate of evolution of the virus
With the rate of evolution measured in real units of time it is possible to infer the date of the most recent common ancestor MRCA for a set of viral sequences
The age of the MRCA of these isolates is a lower bound the common ancestor of the entire virus population must have existed earlier than the MRCA of the virus sample
In April 2009 genetic analysis of 11 sequences of swine-origin H1N1 influenza suggested that the common ancestor existed at or before 12 January 2009
This finding aided in making an early estimate of the basic reproduction number formula_1 of the pandemic Similarly genetic analysis of sequences isolated from within an individual can be used to determine the individual's infection time
Viral spread
Phylodynamic models may provide insight into epidemiological parameters that are difficult to assess through traditional surveillance means
For example assessment of formula_1 from surveillance data requires careful control of the variation of the reporting rate and the intensity of surveillance
Inferring the demographic history of the virus population from genetic data may help to avoid these difficulties and can provide a separate avenue for inference of formula_1
Such approaches have been used to estimate formula_1 in hepatitis C virus and HIV
Additionally differential transmission between groups be they geographic- age- or risk-related is very difficult to assess from surveillance data alone
Phylogeographic models have the possibility of more directly revealing these otherwise hidden transmission patterns
Phylodynamic approaches have mapped the geographic movement of the human influenza virus and quantified the epidemic spread of rabies virus in North American raccoons
However nonrepresentative sampling may bias inferences of both formula_1 and migration patterns
Phylodynamic approaches have also been used to better understand viral transmission dynamics and spread within infected hosts For example phylodynamic studies have been used to infer the rate of viral growth within infected hosts and to argue for the occurrence of viral compartmentalization in hepatitis C infection
Viral control efforts
Phylodynamic approaches can also be useful in ascertaining the effectiveness of viral control efforts particularly for diseases with low reporting rates For example the genetic diversity of the DNA-based hepatitis B virus declined in the Netherlands in the late 1990s following the initiation of a vaccination program This correlation was used to argue that vaccination was effective at reducing the prevalence of infection although alternative explanations are possible
Viral control efforts can also impact the rate at which virus populations evolve thereby influencing phylogenetic patterns Phylodynamic approaches that quantify how evolutionary rates change over time can therefore provide insight into the effectiveness of control strategies For example an application to HIV sequences within infected hosts showed that viral substitution rates dropped to effectively zero following the initiation of antiretroviral drug therapy This decrease in substitution rates was interpreted as an effective cessation of viral replication following the commencement of treatment and would be expected to lead to lower viral loads This finding is especially encouraging because lower substitution rates are associated with slower progression to AIDS in treatment-naive patients
Antiviral treatment also creates selective pressure for the evolution of drug resistance in virus populations and can thereby affect patterns of genetic diversity Commonly there is a fitness trade-off between faster replication of susceptible strains in the absence of antiviral treatment and faster replication of resistant strains in the presence of antivirals Thus ascertaining the level of antiviral pressure necessary to shift evolutionary outcomes is of public health importance Phylodynamic approaches have been used to examine the spread of Oseltamivir resistance in influenza A/H1N1
Methods
Most often the goal of phylodynamic analyses is to make inferences of epidemiological processes from viral phylogenies
Thus most phylodynamic analyses begin with the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree
Genetic sequences are often sampled at multiple time points which allows the estimation of substitution rates and the time of the MRCA using a molecular clock model
For viruses Bayesian phylogenetic methods are popular because of the ability to fit complex demographic scenarios while integrating out phylogenetic uncertainty
Traditional evolutionary approaches directly utilize methods from computational phylogenetics and population genetics to assess hypotheses of selection and population structure without direct regard for epidemiological models
For example
However such analyses were not designed with epidemiological inference in mind and it may be difficult to extrapolate from standard statistics to desired epidemiological quantities
In an effort to bridge the gap between traditional evolutionary approaches and epidemiological models several analytical methods have been developed to specifically address problems related to phylodynamics
These methods are based on coalescent theory birth-death models and simulation and are used to more directly relate epidemiological parameters to observed viral sequences
Coalescent theory and phylodynamics
Effective population size
The coalescent is a mathematical model that describes the ancestry of a sample of nonrecombining gene copies
In modeling the coalescent process time is usually considered to flow backwards from the present
In a selectively neutral population of constant size formula_6 and nonoverlapping generations the Wright Fisher model
the expected time for a sample of two gene copies to coalesce i.e find a common ancestor is formula_6 generations
More generally the waiting time for two members of a sample of formula_8 gene copies to share a common ancestor is exponentially distributed with rate
This time interval is labeled formula_10 and at its end there are formula_11 extant lineages remaining see figure 4
These remaining lineages will coalesce at the rate formula_12 after intervals formula_13
This process can be simulated by drawing exponential random variables with rates formula_14 until there is only a single lineage remaining the MRCA of the sample
In the absence of selection and population structure the tree topology may be simulated by picking two lineages uniformly at random after each coalescent interval formula_15
The expected waiting time to find the MRCA of the sample is the sum of the expected values of the internode intervals
Two corollaries are
Consequently the TMRCA estimated from a relatively small sample of viral genetic sequences is an asymptotically unbiased estimate for the time that the viral population was founded in the host population
For example Robbins et al estimated the TMRCA for 74 HIV-1 subtype-B genetic sequences collected in North America to be 1968
Assuming a constant population size we expect the time back to 1968 to represent formula_19 of the TMRCA of the North American virus population
If the population size formula_20 changes over time the coalescent rate formula_21 will also be a function of time
Donnelley and Tavare derived this rate for a time-varying population size under the assumption of constant birth rates
Because all topologies are equally likely under the neutral coalescent this model will have the same properties as the constant-size coalescent under a rescaling of the time variable formula_23
Very early in an epidemic the virus population may be growing exponentially at rate formula_24 so that formula_25 units of time in the past the population will have size formula_26
In this case the rate of coalescence becomes
This rate is small close to when the sample was collected formula_28 so that external branches those without descendants of a gene genealogy will tend to be long relative to those close to the root of the tree
This is why rapidly growing populations yield trees as depicted in figure 1A
If the rate of exponential growth is estimated from a gene genealogy it may be combined with knowledge of the duration of infection or the serial interval formula_29 for a particular pathogen to estimate the basic reproduction number formula_30
The two may be linked by the following equation
For example Fraser et al generated one of the first estimates of formula_1 for pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009 by using a coalescent-based analysis of 11 hemagglutinin sequences in combination with prior data about the infectious period for influenza
Compartmental models
Infectious disease epidemics are often characterized by highly nonlinear and rapid changes in the number of infected individuals and the effective population size of the virus In such cases birth rates are highly variable which can diminish the correspondence between effective population size and the prevalence of infection Many mathematical models have been developed in the field of mathematical epidemiology to describe the nonlinear time series of prevalence of infection and the number of susceptible hosts A well studied example is the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered SIR system of differential equations which describes the fractions of the population formula_33 susceptible formula_34 infected and formula_35 recovered as a function of time
Here formula_39 is the per capita rate of transmission to susceptible hosts and formula_40 is the rate at which infected individuals recover whereupon they are no longer infectious In this case the incidence of new infections per unit time is formula_41 which is analogous to the birth rate in classical population genetics models Volz et al proposed that the general formula for the rate of coalescence will be
The ratio formula_43 can be understood as arising from the probability that two lineages selected uniformly at random are both ancestral to the sample This probability is the ratio of the number of ways to pick two lineages without replacement from the set of lineages and from the set of all infections formula_44 Coalescent events will occur with this probability at the rate given by the incidence function formula_45
For the simple SIR model this yields
This expression is similar to the Kingman coalescent rate but is damped by the fraction susceptible formula_33
Early in an epidemic formula_48 so for the SIR model
This has the same mathematical form as the rate in the Kingman coalescent substituting formula_50 Consequently estimates of effective population size based on the Kingman coalescent will be proportional to prevalence of infection during the early period of exponential growth of the epidemic
When a disease is no longer exponentially growing but has become endemic the rate of lineage coalescence can also be derived for the epidemiological model governing the disease's transmission dynamics This can be done by extending the Wright Fisher model to allow for unequal offspring distributions With a Wright Fisher generation taking formula_51 units of time the rate of coalescence is given by
where the effective population size formula_53 is the population size formula_6 divided by the variance of the offspring distribution formula_55 The generation time formula_51 for an epidemiological model at equilibrium is given by the duration of infection and the population size formula_6 is closely related to the equilibrium number of infected individuals To derive the variance in the offspring distribution formula_55 for a given epidemiological model one can imagine that infected individuals can differ from one another in their infectivities their contact rates their durations of infection or in other characteristics relating to their ability to transmit the virus with which they are infected These differences can be acknowledged by assuming that the basic reproduction number is a random variable formula_59 that varies across individuals in the population and that formula_59 follows some continuous probability distribution The mean and variance of these individual basic reproduction numbers formula_61 and formula_62 respectively can then be used to compute formula_55 The expression relating these quantities is given by
For example for the SIR model above modified to include births into the population and deaths out of the population the population size formula_6 is given by the equilibrium number of infected individuals formula_66 The mean basic reproduction number averaged across all infected individuals is given by formula_67 under the assumption that the background mortality rate is negligible compared to the rate of recovery formula_40 The variance in individuals basic reproduction rates is given by formula_69 because the duration of time individuals remain infected in the SIR model is exponentially distributed The variance in the offspring distribution formula_55 is therefore 2 formula_53 therefore becomes formula_72 and the rate of coalescence becomes
This rate derived for the SIR model at equilibrium is equivalent to the rate of coalescence given by the more general formula provided by Volz et al Rates of coalescence can similarly be derived for epidemiological models with superspreaders or other transmission heterogeneities for models with individuals who are exposed but not yet infectious and for models with variable infectious periods among others Given some epidemiological information such as the duration of infection and a specification of a mathematical model viral phylogenies can therefore be used to estimate epidemiological parameters that might otherwise be difficult to quantify
Phylogeography
At the most basic level the presence of geographic population structure can be revealed by comparing the genetic relatedness of viral isolates to geographic relatedness
A basic question is whether geographic character labels are more clustered on a phylogeny than expected under a simple nonstructured model see figure 3
This question can be answered by counting the number of geographic transitions on the phylogeny via parsimony maximum likelihood or through Bayesian inference
If population structure exists then there will be fewer geographic transitions on the phylogeny than expected in a panmictic model
This hypothesis can be tested by randomly scrambling the character labels on the tips of the phylogeny and counting the number of geographic transitions present in the scrambled data
By repeatedly scrambling the data and calculating transition counts a null distribution can be constructed and a p"-value computed by comparing the observed transition counts to this null distribution
Beyond the presence or absence of population structure phylodynamic methods can be used to infer the rates of movement of viral lineages between geographic locations and reconstruct the geographic locations of ancestral lineages
Here geographic location is treated as a phylogenetic character state similar in spirit to A T G C so that geographic location is encoded as a substitution model
The same phylogenetic machinery that is used to infer models of DNA evolution can thus be used to infer geographic transition matrices
The end result is a rate measured in terms of years or in terms of nucleotide substitutions per site that a lineage in one region moves to another region over the course of the phylogenetic tree
In a geographic transmission network some regions may mix more readily and other regions may be more isolated
Additionally some transmission connections may be asymmetric so that the rate at which lineages in region A move to region B may differ from the rate at which lineages in B move to A
With geographic location thus encoded ancestral state reconstruction can be used to infer ancestral geographic locations of particular nodes in the phylogeny These types of approaches can be extended by substituting other attributes for geographic locations For example in an application to rabies virus Streicker and colleagues estimated rates of cross-species transmission by considering host species as the attribute
Simulation
As discussed above it is possible to directly infer parameters of simple compartmental epidemiological models such as SIR models from sequence data by looking at genealogical patterns
Additionally general patterns of geographic movement can be inferred from sequence data but these inferences do not involve an explicit model of transmission dynamics between infected individuals
For more complicated epidemiological models such as those involving cross-immunity age structure of host contact rates seasonality or multiple host populations with different life history traits it is often impossible to analytically predict genealogical patterns from epidemiological parameters
As such the traditional statistical inference machinery will not work with these more complicated models and in this case it is common to instead use a forward simulation-based approach
Simulation-based models require specification of a transmission model for the infection process between infected hosts and susceptible hosts and for the recovery process of infected hosts
Simulation-based models may be compartmental tracking the numbers of hosts infected and recovered to different viral strains or may be individual-based tracking the infection state and immune history of every host in the population
Generally compartmental models offer significant advantages in terms of speed and memory usage but may be difficult to implement for complex evolutionary or epidemiological scenarios
A forward simulation model may account for geographic population structure or age structure by modulating transmission rates between host individuals of different geographic or age classes
Additionally seasonality may be incorporated by allowing time of year to influence transmission rate in a stepwise or sinusoidal fashion
To connect the epidemiological model to viral genealogies requires that multiple viral strains with different nucleotide or amino acid sequences exist in the simulation often denoted formula_74 for different infected classes
In this case mutation acts to convert a host in one infected class to another infected class
Over the course of the simulation viruses mutate and sequences are produced from which phylogenies may be constructed and analyzed
For antigenically variable viruses it becomes crucial to model the risk of transmission from an individual infected with virus strain A to an individual who has previously been infected with virus strains B C etc
The level of protection against one strain of virus by a second strain is known as cross-immunity
In addition to risk of infection cross-immunity may modulate the probability that a host becomes infectious and the duration that a host remains infectious
Often the degree of cross-immunity between virus strains is assumed to be related to their sequence distance
In general in needing to run simulations rather than compute likelihoods it may be difficult to make fine-scale inferences on epidemiological parameters and instead this work usually focuses on broader questions testing whether overall genealogical patterns are consistent with one epidemiological model or another Additionally simulation-based methods are often used to validate inference results providing test data where the correct answer is known ahead of time Because computing likelihoods for genealogical data under complex simulation models has proven difficult an alternative statistical approach called Approximate Bayesian Computation ABC is becoming popular in fitting these simulation models to patterns of genetic variation following successful application of this approach to bacterial diseases This is because ABC makes use of easily computable summary statistics to approximate likelihoods rather than the likelihoods themselves
Examples
Phylodynamics of Influenza
Human influenza is an acute respiratory infection primarily caused by viruses influenza A and influenza B
Influenza A viruses can be further classified into subtypes such as A/H1N1 and A/H3N2
Here subtypes are denoted according to their hemagglutinin H or HA and neuraminidase N or NA genes which as surface proteins act as the primary targets for the humoral immune response
Influenza viruses circulate in other species as well most notably as swine influenza and avian influenza
Through reassortment genetic sequences from swine and avian influenza occasionally enter the human population
If a particular hemagglutinin or neuraminidase has been circulating outside the human population then humans will lack immunity to this protein and an influenza pandemic may follow a host switch event as seen in 1918 1957 1968 and 2009
After introduction into the human population a lineage of influenza generally persists through antigenic drift in which HA and NA continually accumulate mutations allowing viruses to infect hosts immune to earlier forms of the virus
These lineages of influenza show recurrent seasonal epidemics in temperate regions and less periodic transmission in the tropics
Generally at each pandemic event the new form of the virus outcompetes existing lineages
The study of viral phylodynamics in influenza primarily focuses on the continual circulation and evolution of epidemic influenza rather than on pandemic emergence
Of central interest to the study of viral phylodynamics is the distinctive phylogenetic tree of epidemic influenza A/H3N2 which shows a single predominant trunk lineage that persists through time and side branches that persist for only 1?5 years before going extinct see {figure 5
Selective pressures
Phylodynamic techniques have provided insight into the relative selective effects of mutations to different sites and different genes across the influenza virus genome
The exposed location of hemagglutinin HA suggests that there should exist strong selective pressure for evolution to the specific sites on HA that are recognized by antibodies in the human immune system
These sites are referred to as epitope sites
Phylogenetic analysis of H3N2 influenza has shown that putative epitope sites of the HA protein evolve approximately 3.5 times faster on the trunk of the phylogeny than on side branches see figure 5
This suggests that viruses possessing mutations to these exposed sites benefit from positive selection and are more likely than viruses lacking such mutations to take over the influenza population
Conversely putative nonepitope sites of the HA protein evolve approximately twice as fast on side branches than on the trunk of the H3 phylogeny indicating that mutations to these sites are selected against and viruses possessing such mutations are less likely to take over the influenza population
Thus analysis of phylogenetic patterns gives insight into underlying selective forces
A similar analysis combining sites across genes shows that while both HA and NA undergo substantial positive selection internal genes show low rates of amino acid fixation relative to levels of polymorphism suggesting an absence of positive selection
Further analysis of HA has shown it to have a very small effective population size relative to the census size of the virus population as expected for a gene undergoing strong positive selection
However across the influenza genome there is surprisingly little variation in effective population size all genes are nearly equally low
This finding suggests that reassortment between segments occurs slowly enough relative to the actions of positive selection that genetic hitchhiking causes beneficial mutations in HA and NA to reduce diversity in linked neutral variation in other segments of the genome
Influenza A/H1N1 shows a larger effective population size and greater genetic diversity than influenza H3N2 suggesting that H1N1 undergoes less adaptive evolution than H3N2
This hypothesis is supported by empirical patterns of antigenic evolution there have been nine vaccine updates recommended by the WHO for H1N1 in the interpandemic period between 1978 and 2009 while there have been 20 vaccine updates recommended for H3N2 during this same time period
Additionally an analysis of patterns of sequence evolution on trunk and side branches suggests that H1N1 undergoes substantially less positive selection than H3N2
However the underlying evolutionary or epidemiological cause for this difference between H3N2 and H1N1 remains unclear
Circulation patterns
The extremely rapid turnover of the influenza population means that the rate of geographic spread of influenza lineages must also to some extent be rapid
Surveillance data show a clear pattern of strong seasonal epidemics in temperate regions and less periodic epidemics in the tropics The geographic origin of seasonal epidemics in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres had been a major open question in the field
However recent work by Rambaut et al and Russell et al has shown that temperate epidemics usually emerge from a global reservoir rather than emerging from within the previous season's genetic diversity
This work and more recent work by Bedford et al and Bahl et al has suggested that the global persistence of the influenza population is driven by viruses being passed from epidemic to epidemic with no individual region in the world showing continual persistence
However there is considerable debate regarding the particular configuration of the global network of influenza with one hypothesis suggesting a metapopulation in East and Southeast Asia that continually seeds influenza in the rest of the world and another hypothesis advocating a more global metapopulation in which temperate lineages often return to the tropics at the end of a seasonal epidemic
All of these phylogeographic studies necessarily suffer from limitations in the worldwide sampling of influenza viruses
For example the relative importance of tropical Africa and India has yet to be uncovered
Additionally the phylogeographic methods used in these studies see section on phylogeographic methods make inferences of the ancestral locations and migration rates on only the samples at hand rather than on the population in which these samples are embedded
Because of this study-specific sampling procedures are a concern in extrapolating to population-level inferences
However through joint epidemiological and evolutionary simulations Bedford et al show that their estimates of migration rates appear robust to a large degree of undersampling or oversampling of a particular region
Further methodological progress is required to more fully address these issues
Simulation-based models
Forward simulation-based approaches for addressing how immune selection can shape the phylogeny of influenza A/H3N2's hemagglutinin protein have been actively developed by disease modelers since the early 2000s
These approaches include both compartmental models and agent-based models
One of the first compartmental models for influenza was developed by Gog and Grenfell who simulated the dynamics of many strains with partial cross-immunity to one another
Under a parameterization of long host lifespan and short infectious period they found that strains would form self-organized sets that would emerge and replace one another
Although the authors did not reconstruct a phylogeny from their simulated results the dynamics they found were consistent with a ladder-like viral phylogeny exhibiting low strain diversity and rapid lineage turnover
Later work by Ferguson and colleagues adopted an agent-based approach to better identify the immunological and ecological determinants of influenza evolution
The authors modeled influenza's hemagglutinin as four epitopes each consisting of three amino acids
They showed that under strain-specific immunity alone with partial cross-immunity between strains based on their amino acid similarity the phylogeny of influenza A/H3N2's HA was expected to exhibit explosive genetic diversity a pattern that is inconsistent with empirical data
This led the authors to postulate the existence of a temporary strain-transcending immunity individuals were immune to reinfection with any other influenza strain for approximately six months following an infection
With this assumption the agent-based model could reproduce the ladder-like phylogeny of influenza A/H3N2's HA protein
Work by Koelle and colleagues revisited the dynamics of influenza A/H3N2 evolution following the publication of a paper by Smith and colleagues which showed that the antigenic evolution of the virus occurred in a punctuated manner The phylodynamic model designed by Koelle and coauthors argued that this pattern reflected a many-to-one genotype-to-phenotype mapping with the possibility of strains from antigenically distinct clusters of influenza sharing a high degree of genetic similarity
Through incorporating this mapping of viral genotype into viral phenotype or antigenic cluster into their model the authors were able to reproduce the ladder-like phylogeny of influenza's HA protein without generalized strain-transcending immunity
The reproduction of the ladder-like phylogeny resulted from the viral population passing through repeated selective sweeps
These sweeps were driven by herd immunity and acted to constrain viral genetic diversity
Instead of modeling the genotypes of viral strains a compartmental simulation model by Gokaydin and colleagues considered influenza evolution at the scale of antigenic clusters or phenotypes
This model showed that antigenic emergence and replacement could result under certain epidemiological conditions
These antigenic dynamics would be consistent with a ladder-like phylogeny of influenza exhibiting low genetic diversity and continual strain turnover
In recent work Bedford and colleagues used an agent-based model to show that evolution in a Euclidean antigenic space can account for the phylogenetic pattern of influenza A/H3N2's HA as well as the virus's antigenic epidemiological and geographic patterns
The model showed the reproduction of influenza's ladder-like phylogeny depended critically on the mutation rate of the virus as well as the immunological distance yielded by each mutation
The phylodynamic diversity of influenza
Although most research on the phylodynamics of influenza has focused on seasonal influenza A/H3N2 in humans influenza viruses exhibit a wide variety of phylogenetic patterns
Qualitatively similar to the phylogeny of influenza A/H3N2Åfs hemagglutinin protein see figure 5 influenza A/H1N1 exhibits a ladder-like phylogeny with relatively low genetic diversity at any point in time and rapid lineage turnover
However the phylogeny of influenza B's hemagglutinin protein has two circulating lineages the Yamagata and the Victoria lineage
It is unclear how the population dynamics of influenza B contribute to this evolutionary pattern although one simulation model has been able to reproduce this phylogenetic pattern with longer infectious periods of the host
Genetic and antigenic variation of influenza is also present across a diverse set of host species
The impact of host population structure can be seen in the evolution of equine influenza A/H3N8 instead of a single trunk with short side-branches the hemagglutinin of influenza A/H3N8 splits into two geographically distinct lineages representing American and European viruses
The evolution of these two lineages is thought to have occurred as a consequence of quarantine measures
Additionally host immune responses are hypothesized to modulate virus evolutionary dynamics
Swine influenza A/H3N2 is known to evolve antigenically at a rate that is six times slower than that of the same virus circulating in humans although these viruses rates of genetic evolution are similar
Influenza in aquatic birds is hypothesized to exhibit evolutionary stasis although recent phylogenetic work indicates that the rate of evolutionary change in these hosts is similar to those in other hosts including humans
In these cases it is thought that short host lifespans prevent the build-up of host immunity necessary to effectively drive antigenic drift
Phylodynamics of HIV
Origin and spread
The global diversity of HIV-1 group M is shaped by its origins in Central Africa around the turn of the 20th century
The epidemic underwent explosive growth throughout the early 20th century with multiple radiations out of Central Africa
While traditional epidemiological surveillance data are almost nonexistent for the early period of epidemic expansion phylodynamic analyses based on modern sequence data can be used to estimate when the epidemic began and to estimate the early growth rate
The rapid early growth of HIV-1 in Central Africa is reflected in the star-like phylogenies of the virus caricatured in figure 2 with most coalescent events occurring in the distant past Multiple founder events have given rise to distinct HIV-1 group M subtypes which predominate in different parts of the world
Subtype B is most prevalent in North America and Western Europe while subtypes A and C which account for more than half of infections worldwide are common in Africa
HIV subtypes differ slightly in their transmissibility virulence effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy and pathogenesis
The rate of exponential growth of HIV in Central Africa in the early 20th century preceding the establishment of modern subtypes has been estimated using coalescent approaches Several estimates based on parametric exponential growth models are shown in table 1 for different time periods risk groups and subtypes The early spread of HIV-1 has also been characterized using nonparametric skyline estimates of formula_53
The early growth of subtype B in North America was quite high
however the duration of exponential growth was relatively short with saturation occurring in the mid- and late-1980s
At the opposite extreme HIV-1 group O a relatively rare group that is geographically confined to Cameroon and that is mainly spread by heterosexual sex has grown at a lower rate than either subtype B or C
HIV-1 sequences sampled over a span of five decades have been used with relaxed molecular clock phylogenetic methods to estimate the time of cross-species viral spillover into humans around the early 20th century
The estimated TMRCA for HIV-1 coincides with the appearance of the first densely populated large cities in Central Africa
Similar methods have been used to estimate the time that HIV originated in different parts of the world
The origin of subtype B in North America is estimated to be in the 1960s where it went undetected until the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s
There is evidence that progenitors of modern subtype B originally colonized the Caribbean before undergoing multiple radiations to North and South America
Subtype C originated around the same time in Africa
Contemporary epidemiological dynamics
At shorter time scales and finer geographical scales HIV phylogenies may reflect epidemiological dynamics related to risk behavior and sexual networks
Very dense sampling of viral sequences within cities over short periods of time has given a detailed picture of HIV transmission patterns in modern epidemics
Sequencing of virus from newly diagnosed patients is now routine in many countries for surveillance of drug resistance mutations which has yielded large databases of sequence data in those areas
There is evidence that HIV transmission within heterogeneous sexual networks leaves a trace in HIV phylogenies in particular making phylogenies more imbalanced and concentrating coalescent events on a minority of lineages
By analyzing phylogenies estimated from HIV sequences from men who have sex with men in London United Kingdom Lewis et al found evidence that transmission is highly concentrated in the brief period of primary HIV infection PHI which consists of approximately the first 6 months of the infectious period
In a separate analysis Volz et al found that simple epidemiological dynamics explain phylogenetic clustering of viruses collected from patients with PHI
Patients who were recently infected were more likely to harbor virus that is phylogenetically close to samples from other recently infected patients Such clustering is consistent with observations in simulated epidemiological dynamics featuring an early period of intensified transmission during PHI These results therefore provided further support for Lewis et al.'s findings that HIV transmission occurs frequently from individuals early in their infection
Viral adaptation
Purifying immune selection dominates evolution of HIV within hosts but evolution between hosts is largely decoupled from within-host evolution see figure 6
Immune selection has relatively little influence on HIV phylogenies at the population level for three reasons
First there is an extreme bottleneck in viral diversity at the time of sexual transmission Second transmission tends to occur early in infection before immune selection has had a chance to operate Finally the replicative fitness of a viral strain measured in transmissions per host is largely extrinsic to virological factors depending more heavily on behaviors in the host population These include heterogeneous sexual and drug-use behaviors
There is some evidence from comparative phylogenetic analysis and epidemic simulations that HIV adapts at the level of the population to maximize transmission potential between hosts This adaptation is towards intermediate virulence levels which balances the productive lifetime of the host time until AIDS with the transmission probability per act A useful proxy for virulence is the set-point viral load SPVL which is correlated with the time until AIDS SPVL is the quasi-equilibrium titer of viral particles in the blood during chronic infection For adaptation towards intermediate virulence to be possible SPVL needs to be heritable and a trade-off between viral transmissibility and the lifespan of the host needs to exist SPVL has been shown to be correlated between HIV donor and recipients in transmission pairs thereby providing evidence that SPVL is at least partly heritable The transmission probability of HIV per sexual act is positively correlated with viral load thereby providing evidence of the trade-off between transmissibility and virulence It is therefore theoretically possible that HIV evolves to maximize its transmission potential Epidemiological simulation and comparative phylogenetic studies have shown that adaptation of HIV towards optimum SPVL could be expected over 100?150 years These results depend on empirical estimates for the transmissibility of HIV and the lifespan of hosts as a function of SPVL
Future directions
Up to this point phylodynamic approaches have focused almost entirely on RNA viruses which often have mutation rates on the order of 10?3 to 10?4 substitutions per site per year
This allows a sample of around 1000 bases to have power to give a fair degree of confidence in estimating the underlying genealogy connecting sampled viruses
However other pathogens may have significantly slower rates of evolution
DNA viruses such as herpes simplex virus evolve orders of magnitude more slowly
These viruses have commensurately larger genomes
Bacterial pathogens such as pneumococcus and tuberculosis evolve slower still and have even larger genomes
In fact there exists a very general negative correlation between genome size and mutation rate across observed systems
Because of this similar amounts of phylogenetic signal are likely to result from sequencing full genomes of RNA viruses DNA viruses or bacteria
As sequencing technologies continue to improve it is becoming increasingly feasible to conduct phylodynamic analyses on the full diversity of pathogenic organisms
Additionally improvements in sequencing technologies will allow detailed investigation of within-host evolution as the full diversity of an infecting quasispecies may be uncovered given enough sequencing effort


Chromosome instability

Chromosomal instability CIN is a type of genomic instability in which chromosomes are unstable such that either whole chromosomes or parts of chromosomes are duplicated or deleted The unequal distribution of DNA to daughter cells upon mitosis results in a failure to maintain euploidy the correct number of chromosomes leading to aneuploidy incorrect number of chromosomes In other words the daughter cells do not have the same number of chromosomes as the cell they originated from
These changes have been studied in solid tumors which may or may not be cancerous CIN is a common occurrence in solid and haematological cancers especially colorectal cancer Although many tumours show chromosomal abnormalities CIN is characterised by an increased rate of these errors
Classification
Numerical CIN is a high rate of either gain or loss of whole chromosomes causing aneuploidy Normal cells make errors in chromosome segregation in 1% of cell divisions whereas cells with CIN make these errors approximately 20% of cell divisions Because aneuploidy is a common feature in tumour cells the presence of aneuploidy in cells does not necessarily mean CIN is present a high rate of errors is definitive of CIN One way of differentiating aneuploidy without CIN and CIN-induced aneuploidy is that CIN causes widely variable heterogeneous chromosomal aberrations whereas when CIN is not the causal factor chromosomal alterations are often more clonal
Structural CIN is different in that rather than whole chromosomes fragments of chromosomes may be duplicated or deleted The rearrangement of parts of chromosomes translocations and amplifications or deletions within a chromosome may also occur in structural CIN
Effects
CIN often results in aneuploidy There are three ways that aneuploidy can occur It can occur due to loss of a whole chromosome gain of a whole chromosome or rearrangement of partial chromosomes known as gross chromosomal rearrangements GCR All of these are hallmarks of some cancers Segmental aneuploidy can occur due to deletions amplifications or translocations which arise from breaks in DNA while loss and gain of whole chromosomes is often due to errors during mitosis
Genome integrity
Chromosomes consist of the DNA sequence and the proteins such as histones that are responsible for its packaging into chromosomes Therefore when referring to chromosome instability epigenetic changes can also come into play Genes on the other hand refer only to the DNA sequence hereditary unit and it is not necessary that they will be expressed once epigenetic factors are taken into account Disorders such as chromosome instability can be inherited via genes or acquired later in life due to environmental exposure One way that Chromosome Instability can be acquired is by exposure to ionizing radiation Radiation is known to cause DNA damage which can cause errors in cell replication which may result in chromosomal instability Chromosomal instability can in turn cause cancer
However chromosomal instability syndromes such as Bloom syndrome ataxia telangiectasia and Fanconi anaemia are inherited and are considered to be genetic diseases These disorders are associated with tumor genesis but often have a phenotype on the individuals as well The genes that control chromosome instability are known as chromosome instability genes and they control pathways such as mitosis DNA replication repair and modification They also control transcription and process nuclear transport
Chromosome instability and cancer
The research associated with chromosomal instability is associated with solid tumors which are tumors that refer to a solid mass of cancer cells that grow in organ systems and can occur anywhere in the body These tumors are opposed to liquid tumors which occur in the blood bone marrow and lymph nodes
Although chromosome instability has long been proposed to contribute to tumor progression recent studies suggest that chromosome instability can either promote or suppress tumor progression The difference between the two are related to the amount of chromosomal instability taking place as a small rate of chromosomal instability leads to tumor progression or in other words cancer while a large rate of chromosomal instability is often lethal to cancer This is due to the fact that a large rate of chromosomal instability is detrimental to the survival mechanisms of the cell and the cancer cell cannot replicate and dies apoptosis Therefore the relationship between chromosomal instability and cancer can also be used to assist with diagnosis of malignant vs benign tumors
A majority of human solid malignant tumors is characterized by chromosomal instability and have gain or loss of whole chromosomes or fractions of chromosomes For example the majority of colorectal and other solid cancers have chromosomal instability CIN This shows that chromosomal instability can be responsible for the development of solid cancers However genetic alterations in a tumor do not necessarily indicate that the tumor is genetically unstable as Åegenomic instabilityÅf refers to various instability phenotypes including the chromosome instability phenotype
The role of CIN in carcinogenesis has been heavily debated While some argue the canonical theory of oncogene activation and tumor suppressor gene inactivation such as Robert Weinberg some have argued that CIN may play a major role in the origin of cancer cells since CIN confers a mutator phenotype that enables a cell to accumulate large number of mutations at the same time Scientists active in this debate include Christoph Lengauer Kenneth W Kinzler Keith R Loeb Lawrence A Loeb Bert Vogelstein and Peter Duesberg
Diagnosis methods
Chromosomal instability can be diagnosed using analytical techniques at the cellular level Often used to diagnose CIN is cytogenetics flow cytometry Comparative genomic hybridization and Polymerase Chain Reaction Karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH are other techniques that can be used In Comparative genomic hybridization since the DNA is extracted from large cell populations it is likely that several gains and losses will be identified
Karyotyping is used for Fanconi Anemia based on 73 hour whole-blood cultures which are then stained with Giemsa Following staining they are observed for microscopically visible chromatid-type aberrations


Content-oriented workflow models

The goal of content-oriented workflow models is to articulate workflow progression by the presence of content units like data-records/objects/documents
Most content-oriented workflow approaches provide a life-cycle model for content units such that workflow progression can be qualified by conditions on the state of the units
Most approaches are research and work in progress and the content models and life-cycle models are more or less formalized
The term content-oriented workflows is an umbrella term for several scientific workflow approaches namely data-driven resource-driven artifact-centric object-aware and document-oriented Thus the meaning of content ranges from simple data attributes to self-contained documents the term content-oriented workflows appeared at first in as an umbrella term Such general term independent from a specific approach is necessary to contrast the content-oriented modelling principle with traditional activity-oriented workflow models like Petri nets or BPMN where a workflow is driven by a control flow and where the content production perspective is neglected or even missing
The term content was chosen to subsume the different levels in granularity of the content units in the respective workflow models it was also chosen to make associations with content management Both terms artifact-centric and data-driven would also be good candidates for an umbrella term but each is closely related to a specific approach of a single working group The artifact-centric group itself i.e IBM Research has generalized the characteristics of their approach and has used information-centric as an umbrella term in Yet the term information is too unspecific in the context of computer science thus content-orientated workflows is considered as good compromise
Workflow Model Approaches
Data-driven
The data-driven process structures provides a sophisticated workflow model being specialized on hierarchical write-and-review-processes
The approach provides interleaved synchronization of sub-processes and extends activity diagrams
Unfortunately the COREPRO prototype implementation is not publicly available
Research on the project had been ceased The general idea has been continued by Reichert in form of the #Object-aware approach
Resource-driven
The resource-driven workflow system is an early approach that considered workflows from a content-oriented perspective and emphasizes on the missing support for plain document-driven processes by traditional activity-oriented workflow engines
The resource-driven approach demonstrated the application of database triggers for handling workflow events
Still the system implementation is centralized and the workflow schema is statically defined
The project appeared in 2005 but many aspects are considered future work by the authors
Research did not continue on the project Wang completed his PhD thesis in 2009 yet his thesis does not mention the resource-driven approach to workflow modelling but is about discrete event simulation
Artifact-centric
The artifact-centric approach appears as a mature framework for general purpose content-oriented workflows
The distribution of the enterprise application landscape with its business services is considered yet the workflow engine itself seems to be centralized
The process enactment seems to be tightly coupled with a technically pre-integrated database management system infrastructure
The latter makes it most suitable for manufacturing process or for organizational processes within a well-defined institutional scope
The approach remains work in progress still it is a relatively old and established project on content-oriented workflows
Funded by IBM it has comparably high number of developers
It is a promising approach
Object-aware
The object-aware approach manages a set of object types and generates forms for creating object instances
The form completion flow is controlled by transitions between object configurations each describing a progressing set of mandatory attributes
Each object configuration is named by an object state
The data production flow is user-shifting and it is discrete by defining a sequence of object states
The discussion is currently limited to a centralized system without any workflows across different organizations
However the approach is of great relevance to many domains like concurrent engineering
Finally the object-aware approach and its PHILharmonicFlows system are going to provide general-purpose workflow systems for generic enactment of data production processes
Distributed Document-oriented
Distributed document-oriented process management dDPM enables distributed case handling in heterogeneous system environments and it is based on document-oriented integration
The workflow model reflects the paper-based working practice in inter-institutional healthcare scenarios
It targets distributed knowledge-driven ad-hoc workflows wherein distributed information systems are required to coordinate work with initially unknown sets of actors and activities
The distributed workflow engine supports process planning & process history as well as participant management and process template creation with import/export
The workflow engine embeds a functional fusion of 1 group-based instant messaging 2 with a shared work list editor 3 with version control
The software implementation of dDPM is -Flow which is available as open source
dDPM and -Flow provide a content-oriented approach to schema-less workflows
The complete distributed case handling application is provided in form of a single active Document -Doc
The -Doc is a case file as information carrier with an embedded workflow engine in form of active properties
Inviting process participants is equivalent to providing them with a copy of an -Doc copying it like an ordinary desktop file
All -Docs that belong to the same case can synchronize each other based on the participant management electronic postboxes store-and-forward messaging and an offline-capable synchronization protocol

Content Management
The bandwidth of Content management systems CMS reaches from Web content management systems WCMS and Document management system DMS to Enterprise Content Management ECM Mature DMS products support document production workflows in a basic form primarily focusing on review cycle workflows concerning a single document Market leaders are Alfresco and EMC with Documentum
Groupware and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work
Groupware focuses on messaging like E-Mail Chat and Instant Messaging shared calendars e.g Lotus Notes Microsoft Outlook with Exchange Server and conferencing e.g Skype
Groupware overlaps with Computer-supported cooperative work CSCW that originated from shared multimedia editors for live drawing/sketching and synchronous multi-user applications like desktop sharing The extensive conceptual claim of CSWC must be put into perspective by its actual solution scope that is available as the CSCW Matrix
Case Handling
The case handling paradigm stems from Prof van der Aalst and gained momentum in 2005 The core features are
a provide all information available i.e present the case as a whole rather than showing bits and pieces
b decide about activities on the basis of the information available rather than the activities already executed
c separate work distribution from authorization and allow for additional types of roles not just the execute role and
d allow workers to view and add/modify data before or after the corresponding activities have been executed
In healthcare the flow of a patient between healthcare professionals is considered as a workflow - with activities that include all kinds of diagnostic or therapeutic treatments The workflow is considered as a case and workflow management in healthcare is to handle these cases
Case handling is orthogonal to content-oriented workflows Some content-oriented workflow approaches are not related to case handling but for example to automated manufacturing In contrast systems that are considered to be case handling systems CHS but which do not apply a content-oriented workflow model are for example BPMone formerly PROTOS and FLOWer from Pallas Athena ECHO from Digital CMDT from ICL and Vectus from London Bridge Group In conclusion those content-oriented workflow approaches that are tightly related to case handling are the #Resource-driven workflow model and the #Distributed Document-oriented workflow model


Abdul Hassan lawyer

Abdul Karim Hassan born 1974 is a Guyana-born naturalized U.S citizen he is a labor lawyer in Queens who is notable primarily for pursuing the right of a naturalized citizen to run for and for himself declaring he will run for president of the United States
In 2012 he filed several lawsuits claiming that the natural-born-citizen clause violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment arguing it was a form of discrimination based on national origin
Political views of Abdul Hassan
He thought that the national debt and budget deficit is the biggest threat to the United States However he said because the national debt and deficit are so large it is impossible to solve the deficit and debt problem with spending cuts and/or tax increases without destroying our way of life The significant tax increases or spending cuts needed to solve the debt problem would have such a huge negative impact on our standard of living that any politician voting for such measures would be voted out of office
Under his plan all budget deficits will be funded by bonds purchased by the Federal Reserve Bank He said We will no longer sell bonds to other countries or to Wall Street If the Federal Reserve holds the bonds the interest paid on those bonds will come back to the United States Treasury instead of going to foreign countries and entities that would otherwise hold the debt
Activities to candidate for president
On July 5 2011 presidential candidate Abdul K Hassan asked the United States Federal Election Committee to issue a ruling as to his rights and obligations under the various federal election laws including the Federal Election Campaign Act After an open meeting on September 1 2011 during which the issues were intensely deliberated the FEC unanimously voted 6-0 the next day The FEC ruled that he can run for President and can solicit and receive contributions The FEC also ruled that he is covered by FECA and am required to comply with the record-keeping contribution and expenditure requirements of the FECA but that he is not eligible to receive matching funds In addition to seeking a ruling from the Federal Elections Commission presidential candidate Abdul K Hassan has asked the election authorities in several states for a ruling on whether he would be allowed presidential ballot access as a naturalized citizen The rulings were sought from the state authorities because even though the Presidency is a federal office ballot access in presidential elections is generally controlled by the states
Legal case of Abdul K Hassan
He filed several lawsuits claiming that the natural-born-citizen clause violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment

Tanks in France

This article deals with the history and development of tanks employed by the military of France from their first use in World War I the interwar period during World War II the Cold War and modern era
Overview
French development into tanks began during World War I as an effort to overcome the stalemate of trench warfare The Schneider CA1 was the first tank produced by France and 400 units were built The French also experimented with various tank designs such as the Frot-Laffly landship Boirault machine and Souain experiment Another 400 Saint-Chamond tanks were manufactured from April 1917 to July 1918 however these tanks were largely underpowered and of limited utility due to the design of the caterpillar tracks which were too short in comparison with the tank's length and weight The most significant French tank development during the war was the Renault FT light tank which set the general layout for future tank designs and was used or redesigned by various military forces including those of the United States
History
World War I
While the British began the design and use of tanks in World War I France at the same time developed its own tracked AFVs but the situation there was very different In Britain a single committee had coordinated design and had to overcome the initial resistance of the Army while the major industries remained passive Almost all production effort was thus concentrated into the Mark I and its direct successors all very similar in shape In France on the other hand there were multiple and conflicting lines of development which were badly integrated resulting in three major and quite disparate production types A major arms producer Schneider took the lead in January 1915 and tried to build a first armoured vehicle based on the Baby Holt tractor but initially the development process was slow until in July they received political even presidential support by combining their project with that of a mechanical wire cutter devised by engineer and politician Jean-Louis Breton In December 1915 the influential Colonel Estienne made the Supreme Command very enthusiastic about the idea of creating an armoured force based on these vehicles strong Army support for tanks would be a constant during the decades to come Already in January and February 1916 quite substantial orders were made at that moment with a total number of 800 much larger than the British ones
Army enthusiasm and haste would have its immediate drawbacks however As a result of the involvement of inexperienced army officers ordered to devise a new tank based on the larger 75?hp Holt chassis in a very short period of time the first French tanks were poorly designed with respect to the need to cross trenches and did not take the sponson-mounting route of the British tanks The first the Char Schneider CA equipped with a short 75?mm howitzer had poor mobility due to a short track length combined with a hull that overhung front and rear It was unreliable as well a maximum of only about 130 of the 400 built were ever operational at the same time Then industrial rivalry began to play a detrimental role it created the heavy Char St Chamond a parallel development not ordered by the Army but approved by government through industrial lobby which mounted much more impressive weaponry ? its 75?mm was the most powerful gun fielded by any operational tank up till 1941 ? but also combined many of the Schneider CA's faults with an even larger overhanging body Its innovative petro-electrical transmission while allowing for easy steering was insufficiently developed and led to a large number of breakdowns
But industrial initiative also led to swift advances The car industry already used to vehicle mass production and having much more experience in vehicle layout in 1916 designed the first practical light tanks a class largely neglected by the British It would be Renault's excellent small tank design the FT incorporating a proper climbing face for the tracks that was the first tank to incorporate a top-mounted turret with a full 360o traverse capability In fact the FT was in many respects the first truly modern tank having a layout that has been followed by almost all designs ever since driver at the front main armament in a fully rotating turret on top engine at the rear Previous models had been box tanks with a single crowded space combining the role of engine room fighting compartment ammunition stock and driver's cabin A very similar Peugeot prototype with a fixed casemate mounting a short 75mm cannon was trialled in 1918 but the idea was not pursued The FT would have the largest production run of any tank of the war with over 3700 built more numerous than all British tanks combined That this would happen was at first far from certain some in the French army lobbied for the alternative mass production of super-heavy tanks Much design effort was put in this line of development resulting in the gigantic Char 2C the most complex and technologically advanced tank of its day Its very complexity ensured it being produced too late to participate in World War I and in the very small number of just ten but it would be the first tank with a three-man turret the heaviest to enter service until late in World War II and still the largest ever operational
French production at first lagged behind the British After August 1916 however British tank manufacture was temporarily halted to wait for better designs allowing the French to overtake their allies in numbers When the French used tanks for the first time on 16 April 1917 during the Nivelle Offensive they had four times more tanks available But that would not last long as the offensive was a major failure the Schneiders were badly deployed and suffered 50% losses from German long-range artillery The Saint-Chamond tanks first deployed on 5 May proved to be so badly designed that they were unable to cross the first line of German trenches
Inter War
The French used a very wide range of tanks including many unique types France was the second largest tank producer in the world behind the Soviet Union see French armoured fighting vehicle production during World War II Their cavalry tank class filled the role of what are now called MBTs They also fielded a heavy tank design and several lighter types for scouting and infantry support In addition to these types they were also working on super-heavy breakthrough tanks FCM F1 The French didn't have an independent Tank Corps All tanks belonged to either the Infantry or the Cavalry
The Renault FT 17 had a long life and saw use in WWII and even later in Indochina It was utilised as far away as in China during the Chinese Civil wars and versions of the tank were used both against and by the Japanese during the invasion of China A large number found their way into both Republican and Nationalist hands during the Spanish Civil War They were used in the Russian Revolution by both the Bolsheviks and the White Russians and later by the Finns against the Soviets France exported the FT 17 right up to World War II The design was also developed by the Italians as the Fiat 3000 and the USSR as the T-18
By the mid-1930s the French Army was replacing the aging FT 17 fleet with a mixed force of light tanks both in the Infantry and Cavalry branches as well as medium and heavy tanks The Infantry light tanks included the Renault R 35 which followed the FT 17 concept quite closely with its very small size two-man crew and short 37?mm gun armament It was however heavily armored The R 35 was mostly used to equip the independent tank battalions an armoured reserve allocated at army level and intended to reinforce infantry divisions in breakthrough operations French infantry divisions normally had no organic tank component The R 35 was exported to Poland and Romania The cavalry had the similar Hotchkiss H 35 armed with the same 37?mm as well as light recon tanks such as the AMR 35
France also produced what may have been the best tank of the 1930s the SOMUA S35 This tank equipped the armoured divisions of the Cavalry which had to execute the exploitation phase of a battle and was probably the best combination of armour firepower and mobility prior to the appearance of the German PzKpfw IV Ausf F2 and Soviet T-34 The S 35 had a long 47?mm gun that could kill any tank then in service as well as heavy cast armour and good speed
The French char de bataille Char B tank was a very formidable tank with heavy cast and riveted armour the same long 47?mm gun as in the S 35 and a hull-mounted 75?mm howitzer All Char Bs were equipped with radio and the tank was nearly invulnerable to most tanks and towed antitank guns They equipped the armoured divisions of the Infantry which were specialised breakthrough units
The French plan of 1926 calling for the creation of a Light Infantry Support Tank led to the development of the existing Renault NC1 prototype into the Char D1 On 23 December 1930 a first order of 70 main production series of Char D1 tanks was made followed on 12 July 1932 by a second order of 30 the last order on 16 October 1933 was of 50 vehicles for a total of 150 delivered between January 1932 and early 1935
In general French tanks of the 1930s were well-armoured innovative vehicles that owed little to foreign designs However the light tanks lacked firepower and almost all French tanks were crippled by their one-man turrets Even the vaunted Char B had a commander who was tasked with commanding the vehicle aiming the main gun and loading the main gun If he were a platoon leader or company commander he had the additional tasks of controlling his other units Such a heavy set of tasks was overwhelming and greatly reduced the effectiveness of the tanks The lack of radios with the light tanks was not seen as a major drawback since French doctrine called for slow-paced deliberate manoeuvers in close conformance to plans the Methodical Battle concept adopted because wargaming showed it to be superior The role of small unit leaders was to execute plans not to take the initiative in combat This was nearly the opposite of German doctrine which stressed initiative and decision-making at low command levels Auftragstaktik In 1939 a belated effort was made to improve flexibility and increase the number of radios
Despite the views of Estienne and later Charles de Gaulle the French general staff failed in defining an effective military doctrine regarding their use due to the division of labour between infantry and cavalry tanks
World War II
At the start of the war France had one of the largest tank forces in the world along with the Soviet British and German forces The French had planned for a defensive war and built tanks accordingly infantry tanks were designed to be heavily armoured Within France and its colonies roughly 5,800 tanks were available during the time of the German offensive and some when they came into contact were effective against the German tanks
The R 35 was intended to replace the FT as standard light infantry tank from the summer of 1936 but even by May 1940 not enough conscripts had been retrained and therefore eight battalions of the older tank had to be kept operational On 1 September 1939 at the outbreak of war 975 vehicles had been delivered out of 1070 produced 765 were fielded by tank battalions in France Of a total order for 2,300 at least 1,601 had been produced until 1 June 1940 serial numbers known to be actually used indicate a production of at least 1670 vehicles
In the Battle of France despite an advantage in number and armour against the Germans the French tanks were not used to good enough effect The infantry tanks were only effective in executing the breakthrough phase of a battle and thus useless as a mobile reserve Ironically cooperation with the infantry was poor The Cavalry units alone were too few in number
The design of French tanks were not inadequate to their German counterparts in fact many French tank designs out-powered various early German tanks used during the first stages of the war One single Char B1 was able to destroy thirteen German tanks within a few minutes in Stonne on 16 May 1940 all of them Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks The 37mm and 20mm guns the Germans used were ineffective at penetrating the thick armour of the B1 which was able to return safely despite being hit a large number of times Even German General Rommel was surprised at how the French tanks withstood the German tank shells and had to resort to using the German 88 artillery as antitank guns against the French tanks to knock them out Setbacks the French military suffered were more related to strategy tactics and organisation than technology and design Almost 80 percent of French tanks did not have radios since the battle doctrine employed by the French military was more a slow-paced deliberate conformance to planned maneuvers French tank warfare was severely restricted as tanks were assigned to infantry divisions and were intended to provide support for infantry Unlike Germany which had dedicated tank divisions France did not separate tanks from the infantry and were unable to respond quickly to the Blitzkrieg tactics employed by the Germans which involved rapid movement mission-type orders and combined-arms tactics
The S35 medium tank entered service in January 1936 with the 4e Cuirassiers At the end of 1937 the SA 35 gun became available and deliveries of the main production series could begin By mid 1938 a hundred had been produced 270 on 1 September 1939 and 246 delivered On this date 191 served with the troops 51 were in depot and four had been sent back to the factory for overhaul After the outbreak of war a fourth order of 200 was made bringing the ordered total to 700 Later it was decided that from the 451st vehicle onward the tanks would be of the improved S 40 type Production in fact totalled 430 by June 1940 including the prototype and the preseries
Of these about 288 were in front-line service at the beginning of the Battle of France with the three armoured divisions of the Cavalry the Divisions Legeres Mecaniques or Mechanised Light Divisions light here meaning mobile Each of these had an organic strength of eight squadrons with ten S35s each squadron however had a materiel reserve of two tanks and regimental and brigade commanders in practice had personal tanks too resulting in a total of 88 vehicles per division Furthermore 31 were present in the general materiel reserve 49 in factory stocks and 26 were being processed for acceptance These vehicles were later issued to several ad hoc units such as the 4th DCR commanded by Charles de Gaulle which received 39 part of 3e Cuirassiers the 4th DLM 10 and some Corps-francs Motorises about 25 Also the destroyed 1st 2nd and 3rd DLM were reconstituted with a small number of tanks the first two divisions received ten S 35s the third twenty S 35s further served with the 7e Cuirassiers 25 and a platoon of three was present in the 3e RAM of the 3e DLC
In May 1940 during the Battle of France the DLMs were tasked with the difficult manoevre of carrying out a quick advance into the Low Countries followed by a holding action to allow the infantry divisions following behind to dig themselves in The 2nd and 3rd DLM were concentrated in the Gembloux gap between Louvain and Namur where there were no natural obstacles to impede a German advance They had to spread out somewhat to hold that sector against incursions by the German 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions This was necessitated by the local tactical situation and did not reflect some fundamental difference in doctrine between the use of the DLMs and the Panzerdivisionen Both types of units were very similar in equipment training and organisation as the German armoured divisions too were primarily intended for strategic exploitation while the breakthrough phase was preferably left to the infantry The resulting tank battle from 13 to 15 May the Battle of Hannut was with about 1700 AFVs participating the largest until that day and is still one of the largest of all time The S 35s gave a good account of themselves proving to be indeed superior to the German tanks in direct combat but they were rather hesitantly deployed as the French High Command mistakenly supposed the gap was the German Schwerpunkt and tried to preserve their best tanks to block subsequent attacks by the rest of the Panzerwaffe
When it transpired the attack was really a feint and the forces in the north were in danger of being cut off by the German advance south of Namur the 1st DLM that had very quickly moved 200 kilometres to the north to help the Dutch was hurriedly rushed south again The resulting disorder and breakdown of most of its S 35s rendered this unit the most powerful of all Allied divisions impotent it was defeated by the German 5th Panzerdivision on 17 May The other DLMs fought a delaying battle participated in the Battle of Arras and then disintegrated Committing its only strategically mobile armour reserve early in the battle had made the French Army fatally vulnerable to a German strategic surprise
After the June 1940 armistice S 35s were allowed to be sent to West Africa to bolster the hold of the Vichy regime on that region They were issued to the 12e regiment de Chasseurs d'Afrique that after French forces in Africa had sided with the Allies operated them against German and Italian forces during the Tunisia Campaign After the liberation of France in 1944 an armoured unit was raised the 13e Regiment de Dragons using French materiel among which were seventeen S 35s
After the fall of France a number of S 35s 297 were captured according to some sources were taken into service with the Wehrmacht as the Panzerkampfwagen 35-S 739(f The Germans modified the cupola by cutting its top off and installing a simple hatch
The 21st and 25 Panzerdivision in 1943 used some S 35s when reforming after having been largely destroyed Some of these units fought in Normandy in 1944 and there were still twelve S 35s listed as in German service on 30 December 1944
After the Fall of France work on new designs such as the Char G1 officially halted although there was some clandestine designing done The Free French forces joined the Allies in fighting the Axis With France occupied by or collaborating with the Nazis leaders such as de Gaulle joined the Allies building a force unit France's vast overseas empire
From July to November 1940 Free French forces would engage in bitter fighting with French troops loyal to Vichy France during the West African Campaign with success and failure on both sides
In November 1940 the Free French claimed victory at the Battle of Gabon also known as the Battle of Libreville De Gaulle personally surveyed the situation in Chad located on the southern border of Libya and the battle resulted in Free French forces taking Libreville Gabon and all of French Equatorial Africa from the Vichy French By the end of 1940 the French Equatorial African colonies now including Gabon had joined the Free French
Soon after de Gaulle established the Empire Defence Council the first step towards the formation of not just a military force but a government in exile During 1941 Free French units fought with the British Commonwealth army against Italian troops in Ethiopia and Eritrea during the East African Campaign
In June 1941 during the Syria-Lebanon campaign Free French forces fighting alongside British Commonwealth forces faced substantial numbers of French troops loyal to Vichy France ? this time in the Levant De Gaulle had assured Churchill that the French forces in Syria would rise to the call of Free France ? but this was not the case After bitter fighting with around 1,000 dead on each side General Henri Dentz and his Vichy Army of the Levant were eventually defeated by largely British Empire forces in July 1941
By the end of 1941 the United States had entered the war and the Soviet Union had also joined the Allied side stopping the Germans outside Moscow in the first major reverse for the Nazis Gradually the tide of war began to shift and with it the perception that Hitler could at last be beaten Support for Free France began to grow though the Vichy French forces would continue to resist Allied armies ? and the Free French ? vigorously until the end of 1942
Bir Hakeim
One of the first key battles the Free French forces fought after they joined the Allies was at Bir Hakeim were they defended against the attack by the Ariete Division in the first phase of the Gazala battle and later under attack by a combined force of the Trieste and 90th Light Infantry Division The battle at Bir Hakeim was at remote oasis in the Libyan desert and the former site of a Turkish fort During the Battle of Gazala the 1st Free French Division of General de brigade Marie Pierre K?nig defended the site from 26 May-11 June 1942 against much larger attacking German and Italian forces directed by Generaloberst Erwin Rommel The battle was later greatly used for propaganda purposes by all involved parties Tobruk was taken 10 days later by Rommel's troops Rommel continued to advance against delaying actions by the British until halted at First Battle of El Alamein in July
General Bernard Saint-Hillier said in an October 1991 interview A grain of sand had curbed the Axis advance which reached Al-Alamein only after the arrival of the rested British divisions this grain of sand was Bir Hakeim
On the night of 26 May 1942 Rommel started a planned attack with the 15th and 21st Panzer Divisions and the rest of the 90th Motorized Infantry Division and the Italian Trieste and Ariete Divisions started the large encircling move south of Bir-Hakeim as planned The British armoured units were taken by surprise and retreated
Rommel then sent the Ariete Armoured Division - to attack Bir Hakeim from the southeast This division - formed of the 132nd Armoured Regiment equipped with M13/40s of the 8th Reggimento bersaglieri and of the 132nd Artillery Regiment - attacked the French position from the rear in two successive waves The Italian tanks and armored vehicles attacked without infantry support and tried to cross the minefield Six tanks managed to infiltrate the French lines avoiding mines and anti-tank fire but they were eventually destroyed by very close range 75?mm fire and the crews were captured
The Ariete Division reduced to only 33 tanks in 45 minutes had to retreat The remaining tanks then tried to outflank the French forces by attacking through the V?zone minefield protecting that face They eventually regrouped and retreated leaving behind 32 destroyed tanks However north of Bir Hakeim the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade had been annihilated and two weakened British brigades - the 4th and the motorized 7th Armoured - were forced to retreat to Bir-el-Gubi and to The El-Adem leaving Bir-Hakeim and the Free French Forces to fight the full brunt of Rommels forces
Rommel's success in the north was very costly and Rommel's wide flanking plan was proving riskier because of the resistance at Bir Hakeim his right flank and supply route was threatened by this position The Afrika Korps had to take Bir Hakeim.So Rommel sent the Trieste division the 90th Light Infantry Division and 3 recon armored regiments from the Pavia division against Bir Hakeim
The German infantry launched a full attack supported by the 15th Panzerdivision with heavy barrages from the artillery A breach was made and on 9 June the evacuation order reached the French camp and the Free French Forces fought their way back to the British lines
Consequences of the battle of Bir Hakeim
For the Free French a victory was badly needed to show the Allies that the army of the Free France was not as often suggested a bunch of desperados but a serious force that could contribute in the battle against the Reich The Free French used the battle to show the world that France was not the decadent nation it appeared to be after its catastrophic defeat in 1940 De Gaulle used it to delegitimize cooperation with the Vichy regime To withstand the overpowering Rommel army was an enormous achievement by Koenig and his men British General Ian Playfair said The lengthened defense of the French garrison played a major role in the re-establishment of the British troops in Egypt The free French gravely disrupted from the beginning Rommel's offensive resulting on a disturbed supply line of the Afrika Korps The growing Axis troop concentration in the sector needed to subjugate the fort saved the British 8th Army from a disaster The delays in the offensive caused by the relentless French resistance increased the British chances of success and eased the preparation of the counter-offensive On long term holding back Rommel allowed the British forces to escape from its meticulously planned annihilation That's why we can say without exaggerating that Bir Hakeim greatly contributed to El-Alamein defensive success General Claude Auchinleck said on June 12 1942 about Bir Hakim The United Nations need to be filled with admiration and gratitude in respect of these French troops and their brave General Koenig Winston Churchill was more terse ÅgHolding back for fifteen days Rommel's offensive the free French of Bir Hakeim had contributed to save Egypt and the Suez Canal's destiniesÅh
Even Adolf Hitler responded to the journalist Lutz Koch coming back from Bir Hakim You hear Gentlemen It is a new evidence that I have always been right The French are after us the best soldiers Even with its current birthrate France will always be able to mobilize a hundred divisions After this war we will have to find allies able to contain a country which is able of military exploits that astonish the world like they are doing right now in Bir-Hakeim
Rommel himself declared that nowhere in Africa was I given a stiffer fight
On 6 June Rommel had already received orders from Hitler to kill all enemy soldiers in battle or shoot them when captured In Hitler's view the Free French troops were a group of partisans rather than regular soldiers that also hosted political refugees from Germany Rommel supposedly burnt this order regardless he never followed it and took Free French soldiers as regular POWs
2nd Armored Division France
The French 2nd Armored Division was commanded by General Philippe Leclerc one of the best French tank commanders General Leclerc joined the Free French forces after the fall of France and adopted the Resistance pseudonym Jacques-Philippe Leclerc Charles de Gaulle upon meeting him promoted him from Captain to Major commandant and ordered him to French Equatorial Africa as governor of French Cameroon from 29 August 1940 to 12 November 1940 He commanded the column which attacked Axis forces from Chad and having marched his troops across West Africa distinguished himself in Tunisia
The French 2nd Armored Division was formed around a core of units that had raided Italian Libya since the end of 1940 to entering Tripoli 1943 under Leclerc but was known for its fight at Kufra in 1941 later renamed the 2nd Light Division in August 1943 it was organized under the US light armored division organization
After landing in Normandy on 1 August 1944 his 2nd Armored Division participated in the battle of the Falaise Pocket 12 to 21 August where they all but destroyed the 9th Panzer Division and went on to liberate Paris Allied troops were avoiding Paris moving around it clockwise towards Germany This was to minimize the danger of the destruction of the historic city if the Germans sought to defend it Leclerc and de Gaulle had to persuade Eisenhower to send Leclerc's 2nd Armored Division and they entered Paris and the liberation by Leclerc help cement de Gaulle's claim as leader of the French
On 25 August the 2nd Armored and the U.S 4th Division entered Paris and liberated it After hard fighting that cost the 2nd Division 35 tanks 6 self-propelled guns and 111 vehicles von Choltitz the German military governor of Paris capitulated at the Hotel Meurice
After the division liberated Paris it defeated a Panzer brigade during the armored clashes in Lorraine forced the Saverne Gap and liberated Strasbourg After taking part in the Battle of the Colmar Pocket the division was moved west and assaulted the German-held Atlantic port of Royan before recrossing France in April 1945 and participating in the final fighting in southern Germany
After the liberation of France the next tank to be introduced would be the ARL 44 heavy tank which came too late to participate in World War II but was used post-war f or a time The ARL 44s equipped the 503e Regiment de Chars de Combat stationed in Mourmelon-le-Grand and replaced seventeen Panther tanks used earlier by that unit
Cold War
Various tank designs were built by France after World War II Tank models such as the AMX-13 and AMX-30 were also exported to various other nations Newer French tank designs sacrificed armour protection for increased mobility due to the idea that the large amount of armour required to protect against modern anti-tank threats would significantly affect maneuverability and that a higher speed and more compact vehicle dimensions would be more effective in protecting the tank from potential threats
A rift formed between France and West Germany following Charles de Gaulle's decision that France would no longer participate in NATO with West Germany opposing a standardised common tank project In 1963 both West Germany and France declared that they would produce purely national tanks Development towards main battle tank projects such as the AMX-30 occurred soon afterwards
AMX-30 production occurred at the Atelier de Construction de Roanne in the town of Roanne This heavy manufacturing factory was built during World War I to produce artillery shells although by 1952 the factory had begun producing armoured fighting vehicles Before producing the AMX-30 for example it had made 1,900 AMX-13s and variants The Roanne factory was responsible for final assembly most components were made elsewhere the powerplant by the Atelier de Construction de Limoges the full armour set by the Ateliers et Forges de la Loire the turret by the Atelier de Construction de Tarbes the cannon by the Atelier de Construction de Bourges the cupola and machine-gun by the Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Etienne and the optics by the Atelier de Construction de Puteaux all these again used many subcontractors In a series of corporate mergers under state guidance most of these firms would eventually be concentrated into GIAT
Originally 300 AMX-30s were ordered by the French Army and by 1971 the order had been increased to 900 divided between eight batches,including all variants based on the chassis.Beginning in 1966 ten AMX-30s were assembled per month and the first five were issued in August 1966 to the 501st Regiment de Chars de Combat Monthly production grew to 15?20 tanks as new factories began to manufacture components of the vehicle and existing factories increased their production potential However in April 1969 production was again reduced to ten per month By 1971 about 180 vehicles were in service in 1975 delivery began of the last 143 units of the final eighth batch of the original order In 1985 the number of AMX-30s had risen to 1173 By the end of production France had accepted 1,355 AMX-30s into service including 166 brand-new AMX-30B2s Another 493 tanks were refitted and modernized to AMX-30B2 standards originally 271 new and 820 refitted vehicles had been planned The French Army also accepted a large number of variants including 195 self-propelled howitzers 44 AMX-30 Pluton tactical nuclear missile launchers 183 AMX-30Rs 134 AMX-30Ds and 48 engineer vehicles AMX-30EBG The last 35 new battle tanks were in 1989 ordered by Cyprus and the last new variant vehicles a batch of twenty GCTs in 1994 by France
In the late 1990s the French Army began to accept the new Leclerc main battle tank to replace the antiquated AMX-30 The first units to be outfitted with the new tank were the 501st and 503rd tank regiments followed by the 6th and 12th Cuirassier Regiments
In the early 1980s the next in the GIAT manufactured export-driven AMX series was designed As the AMX-32 had failed to attract any potential sales the company decided to produce yet another upgrade This was the AMX-40 Main Battle Tank The development of the AMX-40 began in 1980 as a clean sheet design In 1983 the first prototype was finished and presented at the Satory Exhibition of that year Two further prototypes were produced in 1984 the last fourth was fabricated in 1985 The design was not intended for service in France but as a successor to the AMX-32 the improved export version of the AMX-30 However the efforts to obtain foreign orders failed the most serious potential customer to have considered the design being Spain In 1990 it was no longer offered for export

Characteristics
Lamentation
A recurring motif in the artistÅfs work is the exploration of the ancient ritual of lament Group mourning she states is more than a response to a specific grief it can act as a political force Historically a feminine expression lamentation stands in opposition to heroic masculine fantasies of conquest and power Through lamentation she draws attention to the complexities of history incorporating those who have been perennially absent the victims and the defeated According to art critic Adriana Valdes lamentation is both an expression and a silence it lacks articulation WeissÅfs work focuses on this lack of articulation the moment when language collapses in face of the loss of the ability to signify
Body
Weiss uses her body as an artistic tool as a vehicle and a palette Often she employs her body in repetitive and monotonous movements within specific limitations such as submerging herself at long lengths in a concrete receptacle filled with water Ennoia or by rolling around tracing her silhouette on materials such as sheets of canvas Leukos or a bed of books Phlegethon-Milczenie
Performance
Her performances lack dramaturgical plot They are noted for their syncopated rhythms which serve to Ågboth disrupt and paradoxically prolong time.Åh She Ågprovides an alternative experience of space and time which is not end-driven but steady and enduring.Åh
Drawing
Drawing has been described as the touchstone of her art It often ties together the various aspects of her art the technological with the corporeal the communal with the solitary
Featured Works
Ennoia
Enacted in 2002 at the Diapason Gallery in New York the installation involved the artist immersing herself in a concrete basin full of water emerging only periodically throughout the 6-hour duration of the performance A camera suspended from the ceiling recorded the performance and the image of her submerged curled up body was projected on a nearby wall accompanied by sounds from below the surface of the water As described by critic James D Campbell ÅgThe artist seemed to meld her own body to the contours of the water-filled sculpted basin in which it was submersed as though it were a secondary skin a shell-like armature for her vulnerable body providing protection Like an embryo in vitro the font was interpretable as exoskeleton containing a nourishing vat of amniotic fluid replete with the waters of her life.Åh
Leukos
ÅgLeukosÅh was an outdoor performance installation created on the grounds of Lehman College in the Bronx It was part of a series of works titled ÅgIntervals,Åh in which drawings were made by the artist and other participants by tracing their bodies Over the course of two days the artist and other contributors rolled around on large sheets of cotton for several hours at a time tracing their silhouettes with crayons graphite and pigments while wind and rain darkened and blurred the drawings The cotton canvas was then installed in the gallery with a video of the performance projected on the wall behind it accompanied by a soundtrack of opera arias The New York Times wrote of the piece ÅgPartly the work helps make us look at and think differently about the body as an inert object and partly it is all about collapsing together artistic genres - sculpture installation performance and drawing - in a way so wayward as to almost obviate art altogether.Åh
Phlegethon ? Milczenie
For this installation in Potsdam books - philosophical and literary publications from pre-war Germany ? served as objects on which the artist crawled and drew outlining her body while her eyes remained shut In an adjacent room a continuous video was projected based on the performance In a review for The Gazette Montreal Henry Lehmann wrote ÅgSomething that happens in Weiss's work in what seems an objective manner is that at some point the books quit being just books and become primarily art forms They no longer ask to be read but ask rather that we bear witness to their existence and perhaps see their yellowing pages as measures of time.Åh
Sustenazo
First installed in the cellars of the Ujazdowski Castle in Warsaw the multi-media installation was inspired by an event that took place at the castle shortly after the onset of the Warsaw Uprising In August 1944 the occupying German army ordered an immediate evacuation of nearly two thousand hospital patients Many of the seriously ill patients died shortly thereafter Weiss used original documents related to the hospitalÅfs evacuation along with other images and sounds In the video voices in Polish are broken up overlaid with voices in German An eighty year-old Polish woman who was a young nurse at the hospital tells the story of her experience in Polish while another woman's voice reads passages in German from The title Sustenazo is a Greek word meaning Ågto sigh to lament inaudibly together.Åh In her own words ÅgThe act of Åethrowing outÅf a hospital contradicts everything a hospital ought to be a place where human lives are saved Sustenazo evokes that event as a metaphor for war in general.Åh
The artist does not perform in Sustenazo and has not performed in other recent works as to avoid autobiographical interpretations She also stresses that it is not solely about Polish or European history either She explains ÅgIt is more broadly about the loss of lives inflicted by war and by other political and organized acts of violence and oppression For me war is not only devastating it is unacceptable.Åh
Beginning in December 2012 one of the three videos from the exhibition Sustenazo Lament II is being exhibited at the Museum of Memory and Human Rights in Santiago Chile in a solo exhibition that includes an installation from antique books medical instruments and artistÅfs drawings An accompanying catalogue of essays and interviews Monika Weiss Sustenazo Lament II was published in conjunction with the show The show will run through April 2013

Rubya

Rubya or Rubyia is the site of a Catholic Church mission to the south of Bukoba near the west bank of Lake Victoria in Tanzania
A seminary was established at Rubya in 1904 one of the first in German East Africa as it then was The seminary still operates There is a cathedral a nursing school and a district hospital all operated by the church
Location
Rubya is in the Kagera Region of northwestern Tanzania at an elevation of about above sea level
It is located on the edge of a sandstone escarpment with a view of Lake Victoria
The mission is about from Muleba and from Bukoba
The village of Nyakalembe is nearby and provides shops and a Sunday market
The climate is mild with temperatures in the to range
Annual precipitation is about
The Rubya Seminary covers
Seminary
In 1894 the Apostolic Vicariate of Victoria?Nyanza was split into the vicariates of Southern Victoria Nyanza south of Lake Victoria an eastern portion called Upper Nile that was given to the English Mill Hill Missionaries and a northern portion called Northern Nyanza that covered the south and west of today's Uganda
John Joseph Hirth was appointed vicar Apostolic of Southern Victoria Nyanza at that time part of German East Africa on 13 July 1894
The junior seminary of Bukumbi was officially opened in 1903 and in 1904 was transferred first to Bukoba and then to Rubya near the bishop's home
The St Mary's Seminary opened in Rubya in November 1904
Hirth was closely involved in the seminary program
According to some missionaries training priests was more important to him than converting the people
Subjects included Latin history geography writing arithmetic Gregorian chants and German
Hirth forbade all forms of physical punishment humiliation or mockery of the students
Hirth was increasingly interested in Rwanda and starting in 1903 he brought many of the brightest Rwandan pupils to study at Rubya
In 1909 the major seminary was opened for pupils who had completed six years of the minor seminary
By 1911 there were 85 students at Rubya
Hirth moved to Rwanda in 1912 when the new Apostolic Vicariate of Kivu was formed
and Bishop Joseph Sweens became responsible for the Southern Victoria Nyanza vicariate and for the seminary
When a seminary was established in 1913 at Kabgayi in Rwanda some of the students from Rubyia were transferred there
Thirty three seminarians in total returned to Rwanda of whom eighteen were from the major seminary
The students with a good understanding of Latin found to their amusement that the old European priests were less than fluent in that language
During World War I 1914-1918 the French White Fathers had to leave the seminary and return home or find a more hospitable vicariate
In 1917 four priests were ordained at Rubya
Conditions deteriorated in the major seminary during the 1920s with low morale and lack of discipline
In 1929 the major seminary was closed and only the junior seminary continued
After his retirement Sweens lived at Rubya among the seminarians until his death in 1950
The first African rector of the seminary was Joseph Benedict Labre who took office in 1961 2,930 students had attended the junior seminary by 2004
Of these 265 had become priests seven had become bishops and one had been made a cardinal
As of 2004 there were 140 seminarians and 15 teachers The junior seminary mainly relied for income on fees of US$120 per student per year supplemented by some income from small-scale farming and a declining subsidy from Rome
Facilities
Rubya Hospital which serves the district of Muleba was opened in 1956
The hospital was founded by Laurean Rugambwa then Bishop of Rutabo and later the first African cardinal of modern times
The future cardinal had received his secondary school education at the Rubya junior seminary
The hospital can provide basic medical services and has an airstrip
In 1990 the hospital was having difficulty handling the growing number of HIV/AIDS patients and realized there was a need for counselling patients and their families as well as providing clinical care
They contacted WAMATA a self-help organization for people with AIDS obtained support from an international donor and in June 1991 started a pioneer program for home-based care Village health workers are a key element of the program all people with AIDS who have been trained in home care and in managing the illness
As of June 2011 the hospital was suffering from severe shortages of staff equipment and supplies
Apart from the hospital seminary and cathedral there is a school of nursing These are all operated by the diocese
In 2011 the school of nursing had ten teachers and 113 pupils
There are three primary schools a secondary school and vocational schools for carpenters mechanics and builders
Rubya also has a post office Fifteen minutes walk to the south there is a mosque and a Lutheran church

Watermelon stereotype

The watermelon stereotype is a racist stereotype of African Americans that states that African Americans have an unusual appetite for watermelons This stereotype has remained prevalent into the 21st century
History
Watermelons have been viewed as a major symbol in the iconography of racism in the United States since as early as the nineteenth century The truthfulness of this stereotype has been questioned one survey conducted from 1994 to 1996 showed that African Americans at the time 12.5?percent of the country's population only accounted for 11.1?percent of the United States watermelon consumption
While the exact origins of this stereotype remain unclear an association of African Americans and watermelon goes back to the time of slavery in the United States Defenders of slavery used the fruit to paint African Americans as a simple-minded people who were happy when provided watermelon and a little rest The stereotype was perpetuated in minstrel shows often depicting African Americans as ignorant and workshy given to song and dance and inordinately fond of watermelon
For several decades in the late 19th century through to the mid-20th century it was promoted through caricatures in print film sculpture and music and was a common decorative theme on household goods Even as recently as Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and his subsequent administrations watermelon imagery has been used by his detractors In November 2014 Daniel Handler the master of ceremonies at the National Book Awards made a joke about watermelons when a black woman author Jacqueline Woodson received an award In a New York Times Op-Ed published shortly thereafter The Pain of the Watermelon Joke Jacqueline Woodson explained that in making light of that deep and troubled history with his joke Daniel Handler had come from a place of ignorance but underscored the need for her mission to give people a sense of this country's brilliant and brutal history so no one ever thinks they can walk onto a stage one evening and laugh at another's too often painful past
In popular culture
The link between African Americans and watermelons may have been promoted in part by African American minstrels who sang popular songs such as The Watermelon Song and Oh Dat Watermelon in their shows and which were set down in print in the 1870s The 1893 World's Columbian Exposition held in Chicago planned to include a Colored People's Day featuring African American entertainers and free watermelons for the African American visitors whom the exposition's organizers hoped to attract It was a flop as the city's African American community boycotted the exposition along with many of the performers booked to attend on Colored People's Day
Watermelon pictures
At the end of the 19th century there was a brief genre of watermelon pictures ? cinematic caricatures of African American life showing such supposedly typical pursuits as eating watermelons cakewalking and stealing chickens with titles such as The Watermelon Contest 1896 Dancing Darkies 1896 Watermelon Feast 1896 and Who Said Watermelon 1900 1902 The African American characters in such features were initially played by black performers but from about 1903 onwards they were replaced by white actors performing in blackface
Several of the films depicted African Americans as having a virtually uncontrollable appetite for watermelons for instance The Watermelon Contest and Watermelon Feast include scenes of black men consuming the fruits at such a speed that they spew out mush and seeds The author Novotny Lawrence suggests that such scenes had a subtext of representing black male sexuality in which black men love and desire the fruit in the same manner that they love sex In short black males have a watermelon appetite and are always trying to see who can eat the most with the strength of this appetite depicted by black males uncontrollably devouring watermelon
Early-1900s postcards often depicted African Americans as animalistic creatures happy to do nothing but eat watermelon"?? a bid to dehumanize them Other such Coon cards as they were popularly known as depicted African Americans stealing fighting over and becoming watermelons One poem from the early 1900s pictured right reads
In March 1916 Harry C Browne recorded a song titled Nigger Love a Watermelon Ha Ha Ha Such songs were popular during that period and many made use of the watermelon stereotype The script for Gone with the Wind 1939 contained a scene in which Scarlett O'Hara's slave Prissy played by Butterfly McQueen eats watermelon the actress refused to perform this Usage of this stereotype died down circa 1970 although its continued power as a stereotype could still be recognized in period films such as Watermelon Man 1970 The Watermelon Woman 1996 and Bamboozled 2001 Watermelons also provided a theme for many racial jokes in the 2000s
Protesters against African Americans frequently among other things hold up watermelons racist imagery of President Barack Obama consuming watermelon has been the subject of viral emails circulated by political opponents After his election watermelon-themed imagery of Obama has continued to be created and endorsed
In February 2009 Los Alamitos Mayor and Orange County Republican Party Central Committee member Dean Grose tendered his resignation albeit very temporarily after forwarding the White House an email deemed as racist The message displayed a picture of the White House lawn planted with watermelons Grose claimed that he was not aware of the watermelon stereotype A statue of Obama holding a watermelon in Kentucky drew criticism the owner of the statue maintained that the watermelon was there because statue might get hungry standing out here
On October 1 2014 the Boston Herald ran an editorial cartoon depicting an intruder asking if Obama has tried watermelon-flavored toothpaste to much controversy

January 12 1986 was an American chemist During World War II she worked at the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory After the war she became the first woman to be appointed as a division head at the Argonne National Laboratory and the first female to chair the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society
Biography
Hoylande Denune Young was born in Columbus Ohio on June 26 1903 She had a sister Hilda She became interested in chemistry when she was in high school where there were separate boys and girls chemistry classes Due to course scheduling conflicts she was permitted to take the more challenging boys course although she had to sit up the back of the class She entered Ohio State University from which she received a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry in 1924 She then went on to earn a Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Chicago writing her thesis on Stereoisomeric Bromoimino Ketones under the supervision of Julius Stieglitz
After graduating Young became an industrial research chemist working in the lacquer industry at Van Schaack Brothers Chemical Works in Chicago In 1930 she became an assistant professor of chemistry at the Texas State College for Women where she taught nutrition and biochemistry In 1934 she resigned to take up an offer from Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago but when she arrived the director found out that she was a woman and refused to hire her Jobs were hard to find during the Great Depression and she was a consultant with no regular employment until 1938 when she took a position with Pure Oil There she worked with Cary R Wagner Jr on a book on petroleum refining The project went on for six years but it was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II and the book was never published
With the United States at war Young took a job in 1942 as a scientific librarian with the Office of Scientific Research and Development OSRD at the University of Chicago's Toxicity Laboratory compiling American British and Canadian reports on chemical warfare and preparing an index of toxic chemicals In 1945 she transferred to the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory as a chemist There she edited papers that would later be published by the Atomic Energy Commission as part of its National Nuclear Energy Series She later served on the editorial board of the National Nuclear Energy Series representing the Argonne National Laboratory

David Sillar

David Sillar 1760?1830 farmer poet grocer schoolteacher and baillie was a close friend of the poet Robert Burns He died in 1830 aged 70 after a long illness and was buried in Irvine's Old Parish Church cemetery His eroded gravestone was replaced by a facsimile thanks to the Irvine Burns Club He married twice and had only one son survive him a Dr Zachary Sillar M.D of Liverpool His father was Patrick Sillar tenant farmer at Spittalside near Tarbolton Ayrshire He first married a widow Mrs Margaret Kerr nee Gemmell shortly after moving to Irvine and had seven children and his second wife was the sister of John Bryan of the Sun Inn Kilmarnock
Life and character
David was the third son of four his father being Patrick Sillar farmer at Spittalside NS 425 277 near Tarbolton close to the Burns family farm at Lochlea
David was self-taught however he still managed to be appointed as a temporary teacher at Tarbolton the permanent position however went to one John Wilson of Death and Doctor Hornbrook fame Wilson had taught at Craigie Sillars response was to establish an adventure school unsuccessfully at Commonside NS 415 244 which lies between Annbank and Tarbolton After this setback Sillar moved to Irvine in 1783 where he established himself as a grocer under the old Irvine Tolbooth and after bankruptcy in 1791 spent a short spell actually in the Tolbooth the debtors jail It is recorded that he wrote to one his two elder and successful businessmen brothers to ask for a loan of the Åí5 he needed to keep out of debtor's jail but was denied This incident had a lasting effect on him despite the wealth he later acquired
He had once again tried his hand in 1784 as a teacher in Irvine setting up a school of navigation in East Back Road with however the same result as before Makinson however records that this navigation school was very successful providing him with an income of around Åí100 per annum Irvine being a busy port at the time In 1797 he unsuccessfully applied for a job as a teacher of English in Irvine
David recorded his move to Irvine in rhyme -
After this series of setbacks fate played a positive hand and he was fortunate enough to inherit a fortune between Åí30,000 and Åí40,000 from an uncle a partner in Sillar and Henderson a Liverpool mercantile company Makinson states that the fortunes were actually inherited from his elder brothers Robert died 1811 and John who had been very successful in trading between Liverpool and Africa had not married and both died young David also had a younger brother William who died young and left him a considerable sum of money together with the lease of Spittalside Farm David's wife ran the farm and he ran his school returning to work in the fields at the end of each week
After gaining financial security he went on to become a councillor and later on a baillie or magistrate in Irvine His unsuccessful grocer shop was located near the old tolbooth however after receiving the substantial inheritance he bought various properties including a block of four houses north of the cross on the west side of High Street and in 1814 a house at Kirkgatehead He is not recorded as having been a generous benefactor possibly due to his experiences in life He outlived all his family apart from his son who lived in Liverpool
David both played the dulcimer and also the fiddle for which he composed The air A Rosebud by My Early Walk was composed by him and was sent by Burns to be included in Johnson's Musical Museum
Margaret or Peggy Orr was a nurserymaid at Stair House and Robert Burns is said to have lent a hand as a blackfoot with his courtship of this lady however the engagement was brief and she later married John Paton an Edinburgh shoemaker In his first Epistle to Davie entitled An Epistle to Davy a Brother-Poet Lover Ploughman and Fiddler Burns wrote -
Catherine Stewart of Stair and later Afton Lodge became aware of Robert Burns the poet through his visits with David and she was the first member of the upper classes to acknowledge his ability and befriend him
Association with Robert Burns
David was a year younger than Robert and was probably Burns's closest friend his Dainty Davie during his Lochlea days
David Sillar has left us with an important description of Robert Burns during his time at Tarbolton -
Mr Robert Burns was some time in the parish of Tarbolton prior to my acquaintance with him His social disposition easily procured him acquaintance but a certain satirical seasoning with which he and all poetical geniuses are in some degree influenced while it set the rustic circle in a roar was not unaccompanied by its kindred attendant ? suspicious fear I recollect hearing his neighbours observe he had a great deal to say for himself and that they suspected his principles He wore the only tied hair in the parish and in the church his plaid which was of a particular colour I think fillemot he wrapped in a particular manner round his shoulders These surmises and his exterior had such a magical influence on my curiosity as made me particularly solicitious of his acquaintance Whether my acquaintance with Gilbert was casual or premeditated I am not now certain By him I was introduced not only to his brother but to the whole of that family where in a short time I became a frequent and I believe not unwelcome visitant
Of his friendship with David records that -
After the commencement of my acquaintance with the bard we frequently met on Sundays at church when between sermons instead of going with our friends or lassies to the inn we often took a walk in the fields In these walks I have frequently been struck by his facility in addressing the fair sex and many times when I have been bashfully anxious how to express myself he would have entered into conversation with them with the greatest ease and freedom and it was generally a death-blow to our conversation however agreeable to meet a female acquaintance
He was not a founder member of the Tarbolton Bachelor Club however he joined in 1781 and a holograph copy of the rules of the club inn his hand survives
He was a correspondent with Burns after he left Tarbolton in 1785 and was also the subject of two poems by Robert namely the Epistle(s to Davie
In the summer of 1791 David was forced probably due to his failing grocery business to write and ask Burns for a loan however the poet was not in a position to help being just five shillings rich at present
In August 1791 Burns wrote from Ellisland to David who had clearly recently become a married man
In 1826 he was a founder member and first vice-president of the Irvine Burns Club John MacKenzie doctor was the first president In 1925 Provost R M Hogg organised the presentation to the Irvine Burns Club of the chairs used by Dr John MacKenzie and David Sillar as councillors in celebration of the club's centenary
Buchanites
On behalf of Mrs Stewart of Afton Lodge he attended two meetings held by the Buchanites and took notes on their beliefs and practices for which he was at first challenged by Mr Whyte however upon inspection it was accepted that the notes were fair and accurate A link exists here with Robert Burns who had knowledge of the Buchanites and one Jean Gardner a disciple of the sect
Poetry
In 1789 David published a volume of poetry 247 pages long using Robert's printer John Wilson of Kilmarnock and dedicated to Hugh Montgomery Esq of Skelmorlie He was assisted in the sale of his poems by his friend who wrote to him on 22 January 1790 enclosing Åí2 4S 0d from eleven subscribers to David's poems a letter now in the possession of the Irvine Burns Club Unfortunately the poems were mediocre and were not well received Makinson comments that his poetry was ponderous lacked humour and was somewhat coarse It has been suggested that his later failure as a grocer in Irvine was in part related to the time he spent on composing poetry
In his second Epistle to Davie Burns wrote:-
The Irvine Burns Club possesses two original letters from Robert Burns to David Sillar purchased by the club in 1975 from the Rev David Sillar Wetherby Yorkshire a great-great-grandson Both letters were written from Ellisland Dumfriesshire and are dated 5 August 1789 and 22 January 1790 They are warm friendly letters and deal with Burns obtaining eleven subscribers for Sillar's own book of poems published in 1789
The Irvine Burns Club also possess a copy in Sillar's own handwriting of a speech partly in poetical form given by David Sillar as Vice-President of Irvine Burns Club at the inaugural celebration dinner in January 1828 The manuscript was presented to the Club by his son Dr Zachariah Sillar M.D President of the Club 1830?31
Micro-history
David Sillar's subscribed to the Burns Monument at Alloway and was one of the first to do so A tradition in Irvine has it that upon being asked to subscribe to a monument for his friend he said I cannot do so You starved him when alive and you cannot with good grace erect a monument to him now Makinson has it that Sillar said No no ye starved the man when he was living among ye and I refuse to join in useless expenditure now that he is dead
David was the first on the members list and Gilbert Burns was also a member of the Mauchline Conversation Society that met to discuss a wide range of topics such as moral questions politics etc
He lent Åí4,000 to the daughter of Catherine Stewart of Stair House
Thanks to his only recorded generous donations to Irvine Academy totalling Åí100 he was made a life Director of the school

Nanocapsules

Nanocapsules are nanoscale shells made out of a nontoxic polymer They are vesicular systems that are made up of a polymeric membrane which encapsulates an inner liquid core at the nanoscale level Nanocapsules have a myriad of uses which include medical promising applications for drug delivery food enhancement nutraceuticals and for the self-healing of materials The benefits of encapsulation methods are for protection of these substances to protect in the adverse environment for controlled release and for precision targeting
Structure
The typical size of the nanocapsule used for various applications ranges from 10nm-1000nm However depending on the preparation and use of the nanocapsule the size will be more specific
Nanocapsule structure consists of nano-vesicular system that is formed in a core-shell arrangement The shell of a typical nanocapsule is made of a polymeric membrane or coating The type of polymers used is of biodegradable polyester as nanocapsules are often used in biological systems Poly-e-caprolactone PCL poly(lactide PLA and poly(lactide-co-glicolide PLGA are typical polymers used in nanocapsule formation Other polymers include thiolated poly(methacrylic acid and poly(N-vinyl Pyrrolidone As synthetic polymers have proven to be more pure and reproducible when compared naturally occurring polymers they are often preferred for the construction nanocapsules However some natural occurring polymers such as chitosan gelatin sodium alginate and albumin are used in some drug delivering nanocapsules Other nanocapsule shells include liposomes along with polysaccharides and saccharides Polysaccharides and saccharides are used due to their non-toxicity and biodegradability They are attractive to use as they resemble biological membranes
The core of a nanocapsule is composed of an oil surfactant that is specifically selected to coordinate with the selected drug within the polymeric membrane The specific oil used must be highly soluble with the drug as well as non-toxic when used in a biological environment 5The oil /drug emulsion must have low solubility with the polymer membrane to insure that the drug will be carried throughout the system properly and be released at the proper time and location When the proper emulsion is obtained the drug should be uniformly dispersed throughout the entire internal cavity of the polymeric membrane
Processing
The encapsulation technique depends on the requirements for any given drug or substance These processes depend on the physiochemical properties of the core material the wall material and the required size The most common ways of producing nanocapsules are nanoprecipitation emulsion-diffusion and solvent-evaporation
In the nanoprecipitation method also known as solvent displacement method nanocapsules are formed by creating a colloidal suspension between two separate phases The organic phase consists of a solution and a mixture of organic solvents The aqueous phase consists of a mixture of non-solvents that forms a surface film The organic phase is slowly injected in the aqueous phase which then is agitated to form the colloidal suspension Once the colloidal suspension is formed it will be agitated until nanocapsules begin to form The size and shape of the nanocapsule depend on the rate of injection along with the rate of agitation
Another common way to prepare nanocapsules is the emulsion diffusion method This method consists of three phases organic aqueous and dilution phase In this method the organic phase is added to the aqueous phase under conditions of high agitation which create an emulsion During this process water is added to the emulsion which causes the solvent to diffuse The result of this emulsion- diffusion is nanocapsule formation
Solvent evaporation is another effective method of nanocapsule preparation In this process single or double emulsions are created from solvents and are used to formulate a nanoparticle suspension High speed homogenization or ultrasonication is used to create small particle size in the nanoparticle suspension Once the suspension is stable the solvents are evaporated using either continuous magnetic stirring at room temperature or by reducing the pressure
The table below displays how nanocapsules exhibit different characteristics based on the method in which they were prepared Each nanocapsules is varied by size drug concentrations and active substance release time
Processing Issues and Solutions
Since nanocapsules tend to aggregate and become unstable substances within the capsule can leak To control the instability nanocapsules can be dried either through spray drying or freeze drying lyophilization
Spray drying ? Solutions are sprayed into a drying medium This technique is more widely used in the food industry and used for encapsulation of many food products as flavors minerals colors and vitamins This technique not only makes nanocapsules more stable but increases shelf-life of foods
Freeze drying ? This process involves dehydration of materials that are heat-sensitive Unlike spray drying water is removed through the sublimation process without changing the structure or shape of the nanoparticles Freeze drying involves four states freezing primary drying secondary drying and storage Because of the multiple stages involved this technique is considered more energy intensive and time consuming
Properties
Absorbability
Aspect ratio affects the ability of the nanocapsule to penetrate tumor cells Low aspect ratio spherical tends to penetrate cells more easily than high aspect ratios rod-shaped cells
Structure
The nano-sized structure of nanocapsules allows for the permeation through cell membranes which makes them effective carriers of medicine in biological systems The specific processing of nanocapsules gives them unique properties in how the release drugs in certain situations Generally there are three physico-chemical release mechanisms that are used to release the drug or medicine from the polymeric shell of the nanocapsule
Delivery
Other Methods of Delivery Substance Delivery in Medical Use
Near-infrared light Drug release is triggered from heat The infrared technology can be absorbed deep in the body turn to heat The heat-sensitive material particularly a polymer shell that swells upon heating collapses The action of deflating is what releases the drug
Magnetic Fields Magnetic bars of millimeter-scale are embedded in poly(vinyl alcohol The magnetic field within the bars is alternated which results in the change of shape and ultimate collapse of the nanocapsules The change in the structure then triggers the drug release
Ultrasound Another option of drug release is through ultrasound which is a Åglongitudinal pressure waveÅh The ultrasound can either be low-frequency or LFUS between ~20 and ~100 kHz or high-frequency HFUS >1 MHz Transdermal delivery sonophoresis is enhanced through LFUS which then further allows the drug to be released Since the wave of HFUS is higher success of drug delivery has be demonstrated through the form of bubbles The bubbles with in the capsule are formed and collapsed due to the higher temperatures of the wave
Some other ways include oral which is the most active nasal transdermal and through the lung Oral is the most common and the most challenging Demands for consistent release persist although developments are being made for drugs to bioadhere to the intestinal tract Bioadhesion is also being considered for nasal delivery in order to prolong the life of the drug within the nose Drugs can also be transferred though the skin transdermal Inhalers are also of interest as asthma drugs for example consist of macro-molecules Currently the inhalation systems are undesirables to patients and it is hoped that there will be advances in this delivery system at some point
Nanocapsule Applications
Cancer
Water soluble polymer shells are being created to deliver a protein apoptin into cancer cells The protein goes into the nucleus of the cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone unlike other conventional therapies as gene therapies and chemotherapy The capsules are 100 nm in size
Active targeting of cancer cells is also being researched Through active targeting the nanocapsules form ligands that bind to malignant cells for cell delivery This method is especially beneficial for those drugs that are not as permeable through the cell membrane and where tissues are diseased the nanoparticles are able to bond easier with the malignant cells
Food Usage
Nanoencapuslation in foods involves the changing of textures flavorings colorings and stability in shelf-life
Nutraceuticals
Nutraceuticals are substances that are placed in food to enhance nutrition The increased bioavailability of these substances is relative to the size of the nanocarrier The smaller the nanocarrier the better the delivery properties and the solubility of the nutraceuticals the nanocarrier is able to enter the bloodstream easier if smaller
Lipid or polymer-based natural biodegradable are used for encapsulation for nutraceuticals Types of polymers used include collagen gelatin and albumin
Ethyl Alcohol Absorption
Relatively new research involves the encapsulation of digestive enzymes within a non-toxic polymer shell The enzyme filled nanoshell has been proven in lab mice to absorb ethyl alcohol from the bloodstream therefore resulting in reduced blood alcohol levels It has been concluded that the particles act as organelles which proposes other benefits to enzyme therapies This discovery is introducing other studies such as encapsulation methods for hair loss
Self-Healing Materials
For materials such as components in microelectronics polymeric coatings and adhesives nanocapsules can reduce damage caused by high loads The healing of cracks within these materials is alleviated by dispersing nanocapsules within the polymer The healing substances include dicyclopentadiene DCPD which is prepared on site within the material by sonication The nanoencapsulated material is first emulsified within the material by creating an oil-in-water self-healing epoxy The emulsified material is then agitated within the material to create particles which then bond to the host material
Concerns of Nanoparticle Use
It is unknown what the impacts of nano-sized materials are to human health and the environment at this point It is only through chemical risk assessment and toxic assessments with time can affirm any effects The measures for testing are currently insufficient and the approval for the use of nanoparticles particularly in food is ambiguous


Jose Maria Larocca

Jose Maria Larocca Jr born 1 January 1969 is an Argentinian equestrian His discipline is show jumping usually individually Larocca currently ranks two hundred and seventy-sixth on the FEI Rolex Ranking List
Larocca was a relatively late starter to competitive equestrianism beginning his show jumping career at age thirty-four Larocca had ridden horses between the ages of three and twenty but had then left Argentina for Europe to focus on other forms of work until his love of horses brought him back to the sport His first major competition was in 2008 for the Lyon Grand Prix and when he completed the course with no faults he was inspired to continue Larocca has appeared twice in the FEI World Equestrian Games and twice in the Summer Olympic Games representing Argentina
Larocca received media attention when he purchased the horse Okidoki for unspecified millions with the intent of riding him in the 2012 Summer Olympics Okidoki suffered a hamstring injury during an event in Cannes in 2010 which initially appeared to be treated successfully but developed septic shock from surgical complications
Biography
Larocca was born in Wettingen Switzerland on 1 January 1969 He began riding at the age of three and rode in Argentina until the age of twenty At that age he moved back to Europe to concentrate on other forms of work
Larocca began riding again in 2003 at the age of thirty-four after being unable to forget his love of horses In 2008 Larocca completed the Lyon Grand Prix with no jumping faults making him believe that he could compete at the highest level of equestrianism In 2009 Larocca came in third at the Zurich Grand Prix sixth at the Valencia Grand Prix and sixth at the Patrignano Grand Prix In 2011 Larocca came in fourth at the Frankfurt Grand Prix and in 2012 he came in sixth at the Valkenswaard Grand Prix
Larocca has competed in the FEI World Equestrian Games twice He first competed in the 2006 FEI World Equestrian Games for both individual and team on his horse Svante in individual he came in seventy-third and he was part of the seventeenth-ranking team He then competed in the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games for both individual and team on his horse Con Air 7 in individual he came in forty-first and he was part of the twenty-seventh-ranking team Every time he was competing for Argentina
Larocca has competed in individual jumping at the Summer Olympic Games on two occasions First in 2008 Larocca came in fifty-eighth not passing the second qualifier Larocca tried again in 2012 and came in thirty-eighth not passing the third qualifier Both times Larocca represented Argentina and rode on the horse Royal Power
Personal life
Larocca has said that his greatest inspiration is his optimistic father and Larocca's personal motto is Always believe in yourself
Horses
Larocca purchased the horse Okidoki for unspecified millions with the intention of riding him in the 2012 Olympics The horse was already known as the mount of Albert Zoer of the Netherlands who won team gold at the 2006 FEI World Equestrian Games the 2007 European Championships and the 2007 Olympia Grand Prix in London However after Okidoki injured a hamstring during an event in Cannes he developed complications from surgery and died in late July 2010 of septic shock in the abdomen despite initially being proclaimed well shortly after the hamstring surgery As a result of the loss of Okidoki Larocca instead rode Royal Power at the Olympics


Jean Blouf

Jean Blouf or Plouf Plouffe in modern French or Ploof in Americanized French 1643 Paris - 15 April 1700 Montreal was a pioneer of New France's Quebec He was one of the colonists of New France in Vercheres during 1672 when the lordship there was created under the Kingdom of France
Youth
Jean Blouf's parents were Antoine Blouf or Antoine Plouffe from Abbeville born 1615 and Genevieve Demest or DeMetz from Paris where they were married 24 February 1641 It has been recognized Jean Blouf had already crossed to the New World in 1665 at the age of 22 He was thus the patriarch of the Blouf or Plouffe family in the Americas commonly Americanized to Ploof in the United States of America's northeast
Voyage to the New World
Many of the French volunteers on the King's voyage to New France were neither persecuted nor poor but common French Catholics The voyage was seen as an adventure and opportunity for these young men many of which were illiterate and of comfortable background but not noble family Also the King of France had offered benefits to go to New France The Company of One Hundred Associates was created in Quebec's lordships then subdivided into concessions to immigrants These immigrants were often engaged for a period of three years This was nicknamed the 36 Months Most recruits were single paid from 40 to 120 pounds per year In addition they were transported to New France and received free land When Samuel de Champlain died in 1635 there were 132 settlers in the colony including 35 from the Perche
Most departures took place in the period 1634?1662 Poor travelers from France to the New World were victims of all the perils of storms pirates and disease The journey could vary from one to three months For example it took 117 days for Jean Talon to reach Quebec in 1665 but only 35 days for the ship Arc-en-ciel to do so in 1678 For navigation it was better to sail from France before 1 May Boats in the 17th century were generally smaller than 200 tons so the accommodations were modest Despite all the difficulties and dangers the majority of sailors and passengers arrived safely
Marriage
The first official mention of Jean Blouf in Canada is Ville-Marie in the census of 1666 in Boucherville while trying to establish a trade as a cobbler However he soon left this for the employment under Lord Francois Jarret de Vercheres from whom he received a concession of land The grant consisted of several acres on the side of Contrecoeur In exchange for the grant he had to establish residence there When Jean decided to accept the conditions he had already been residing there for some time knowing the resources and climate This allowed him to quickly acclimate and begin progressing his colonial career
Meanwhile on 24 June 1669 in the Chapel of Our Lady of the Hotel-Dieu in Montreal Jean married Madeleine Guilleb?uf one of King's Daughters whom was born in 1655 in Rouen in Normandy The King's Daughters were 800 young women who volunteered for King Louis XIV of France to immigrate to New France in order to promote colonization through marriage and foundation of families It was common in those days that men marry before age 30 and women before age 20 She was the daughter of Nicolas and Madeleine Vauclin Guilleb?uff both of Rouen married there in 1654
Legacy
Respected in the community Jean Blouf is also remembered as one of the top ten landowners of Vercheres Most historians believe he was buried in 1700 in Montreal From his marriage came five boys and two girls with at least two surviving to go on and have children of their own The Blouf or Plouffe family donated land for the first church in Vercheres After his death his wife remarried and died in 1708 Thanks to Jean Blouf of Vercheres thousands of people find themselves today named Plouffe across the North America including mathematician Simon Plouffe and a noted American Civil War soldier from New York's North Country New York named Peter Ploof who was felled for the Union's Straw Hat Regiment in the Battle of Eltham's Landing The family due to Jean Blouf's colonial prominence also gave its name to a district of Laval and a famous novel
The name of Blouf could correspond to the former French baloffe or chaff Later it became a surname Some variations of the name Blouf include Blouffe Ploof Plouff Plouffe Pluff etc

In the pre-1955 state highway system LA 3018 was designated as State Route C-2052 LA 3018 was created with the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering and until the 2000s its route extended further south on Destrehan Avenue to Patriot Street
Louisiana Highway 3019
Louisiana Highway 3019 LA 3019 runs in a west?east direction primarily along Veterans Highway in New Orleans Orleans Parish
The route begins on the east side of the 17th Street Canal bridge at the Jefferson?Orleans parish line and proceeds east along Veterans Highway the continuation of Veterans Memorial Boulevard in New Orleans Eastbound traffic turns south onto Pontchartrain Boulevard and immediately enters an interchange with I-10 and I-610 Westbound traffic utilizes parallel West End Boulevard LA 3019 is a divided six-lane highway on Veterans Highway and a divided four-lane highway on Pontchartrain and West End Boulevards
LA 3019 is a vestige of the original plans for the Pontchartrain Expressway and its connection to Veterans Highway which at the time ended just west of the parish line in Metairie In the pre-1955 state highway system the planned Pontchartrain Expressway Greater New Orleans Bridge now known as the Crescent City Connection and Westbank Expressway were given the collective designation of State Route C-2200 This became LA 3019 with the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering and the majority of the route was later incorporated into I-10 and US 90 Business The remaining segment connecting Veterans Memorial Boulevard in Metairie with the I-10/I-610 interchange retains the LA 3019 designation
Louisiana Highway 3021
Louisiana Highway 3021 LA 3021 runs in a north?south direction along Elysian Fields Avenue in New Orleans Orleans Parish
The route begins at North Claiborne Avenue a junction with LA 39 and LA 46 and proceeds north along Elysian Fields Avenue LA 3021 engages in interchanges with both I-10 and I-610 passing over the Norfolk Southern Railway NS tracks in between before ending at US 90 Gentilly Boulevard It is a six-lane divided highway for its entire length
LA 3021 is a vestige of the original plans for the Eastern Expressway incorporated into the route for I-10 by the time of its construction in the 1960s which would have connected Eastern New Orleans with North Claiborne Avenue via an expressway in the median of Elysian Fields Avenue In the pre-1955 state highway system the proposed route was given the temporary designation of State Route C-2200 changed to LA 3021 in the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering The Elysian Fields Avenue segment as well as a segment of Morrison Road that is now LA 1253 were ultimately left out of the expressway plans Though never connected both retained the LA 3021 designation until the latter segment was given its own number in 2002
Louisiana Highway 3046
Louisiana Highway 3046 LA 3046 runs in a north?south direction along Causeway Boulevard in Jefferson Parish
The route begins in Jefferson at a partial interchange with US 90 Jefferson Highway It proceeds north and becomes elevated to cross the New Orleans Public Belt NOPB and Canadian National Railway CN tracks and LA 3139 Earhart Expressway LA 3046 ends shortly afterward at a multi-level rotary interchange with US 61 Airline Drive in Metairie It is a divided four-lane highway for its entire length North Causeway Boulevard continues ahead as a local road through Metairie to I-10 Exit 228 and ultimately the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway
LA 3046 originated as part of the Greater New Orleans Expressway a 1950s project to build a multilane highway in the center of what was Harlem Avenue now Causeway Boulevard connecting US 90 Jefferson Highway US 61 Airline Highway and Veterans Highway to the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway then under construction Only the portion south of US 61 is state-maintained and carries the designation LA 3046 The route was opened to traffic in June 1957 and has remained the same to the present day although the US 90 intersection was altered in 1999 when the hook ramp was converted to carry one-way traffic

History of serfdom

Like slavery serfdom has a long history dating to the Ancient Times
Social institutions similar to serfdom were known in ancient world The status of the helots in the ancient Greek city-state of Sparta resembled that of the medieval serfs By the 3rd century AD the Roman Empire faced a labour shortage Large Roman landowners increasingly relied on Roman freemen acting as tenant farmers instead of slaves to provide labour
These tenant farmers eventually known as coloni saw their condition steadily erode Because the tax system implemented by Diocletian assessed taxes based on both land and the inhabitants of that land it became administratively inconvenient for peasants to leave the land where they were counted in the census In 332 AD Emperor Constantine issued legislation that greatly restricted the rights of the coloni and tied them to the land Some see these laws as the beginning of medieval serfdom in Europe
However medieval serfdom really began with the breakup of the Carolingian Empire around the 10th century The demise of this empire which had ruled much of western Europe for more than 200 years was followed by a long period during which no strong central government existed in most of Europe
During this period powerful feudal lords encouraged the establishment of serfdom as a source of agricultural labor Serfdom indeed was an institution that reflected a fairly common practice whereby great landlords were assured that others worked to feed them and were held down legally and economically while doing so
This arrangement provided most of the agricultural labour throughout the Middle Ages Slavery persisted right through the Middle Ages but it was rare diminishing and largely confined to the use of household slaves Parts of Europe including much of Scandinavia never adopted many feudal institutions including serfdom
In the later Middle Ages serfdom began to disappear west of the Rhine even as it spread through eastern Europe This was one important cause for the deep differences between the societies and economies of eastern and western Europe
In Western Europe the rise of powerful monarchs towns and an improving economy weakened the manorial system through the 13th and 14th centuries and serfdom was rare following the Renaissance
Serfdom in Western Europe came largely to an end in the 15th and 16th centuries because of changes in the economy population and laws governing lord-tenant relations in Western European nations The enclosure of manor fields for livestock grazing and for larger arable plots made the economy of serfsÅf small strips of land in open fields less attractive to the landowners Furthermore the increasing use of money made tenant farming by serfs less profitable for much less than it cost to support a serf a lord could now hire workers who were more skilled and pay them in cash Paid labour was also more flexible since workers could be hired only when they were needed
At the same time increasing unrest and uprisings by serfs and peasants like TylerÅfs Rebellion in England in 1381 put pressure on the nobility and the clergy to reform the system As a result serf and peasant demands were accommodated to some extent by the gradual establishment of new forms of land leases and increased personal liberties
Another important factor in the decline of serfdom was industrial development?especially the Industrial Revolution With the growing profitability of industry farmers wanted to move to towns to receive higher wages than those they could earn working in the fields while landowners also invested in the more profitable industry This also led to the growing process of urbanization
Serfdom reached Eastern Europe centuries later than Western Europe?it became dominant around the 15th century Before that time Eastern Europe had been much more sparsely populated than Western Europe and the lords of Eastern Europe created a peasantry-friendly environment to encourage migration east Serfdom developed in Eastern Europe after the Black Death epidemics which not only stopped the migration but depopulated Western Europe
The resulting large land-to-labour ratio combined with Eastern Europe's vast sparsely populated areas gave the lords an incentive to bind the remaining peasantry to their land With increased demand for agricultural produce in Western Europe during the later era when Western Europe limited and eventually abolished serfdom serfdom remained in force throughout Eastern Europe during the 17th century so that nobility-owned estates could produce more agricultural products especially grain for the profitable export market
Such Eastern European countries included Prussia Prussian Ordinances of 1525 Austria Hungary laws of the late 15th and early 16th centuries the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth szlachta privileges of the early 16th century and the Russian Empire laws of the late 16th and first half of the 17th century This also led to the slower industrial development and urbanisation of those regions Generally this process referred to as second serfdom or export-led serfdom which persisted until the mid-19th century became very repressive and substantially limited serfs rights Before the 1861 abolition of serfdom in Russia a landowner's estate was often measured by the number of souls he owned a practice made famous by Gogol's 1842 novel Dead Souls
In many of these countries serfdom was abolished during the Napoleonic invasions of the early 19th century Serfdom remained in force in most of Russia until the Emancipation reform of 1861 enacted on February 19 1861 though in Russian Baltic provinces it had been abolished at the beginning of the 19th century According to the Russian census of 1857 the number of private serfs in Russia was 23.1 million Russian serfdom was perhaps the most notable Eastern European institution as it was never influenced by German law and migrations and serfdom and the manorial system were enforced by the crown Tsar not the nobility
The decline of serfdom
In Western Europe serfdom became progressively less common through the Middle Ages particularly after the Black Death reduced the rural population and increased the bargaining power of workers Furthermore the lords of many manors were willing for payment to manumit release their serfs
In England the end of serfdom began with the Peasants Revolt in 1381 It had largely died out in England by 1500 as a personal status and was fully ended when Elizabeth I freed the last remaining serfs in 1574 Land held by serf tenure unless enfranchised continued to be held by what was thenceforth known as a copyhold tenancy which was not completely abolished until 1925 although it was whittled away during the 19th and early 20th centuries There were native-born Scottish serfs until 1799 when coal miners previously kept in serfdom gained emancipation However most Scottish serfs had been freed before this time
Serfdom was de facto ended in France by Philip IV Louis X 1315 and Philip V 1318 With the exception of a few isolated cases serfdom had ceased to exist in France by the 15th century In Early Modern France French nobles nevertheless maintained a great number of seigneurial privileges over the free peasants that worked lands under their control Serfdom was formally abolished in France in 1789
In other parts of Europe there had been peasant revolts in Castille Germany northern France Portugal and Sweden Although these were often successful it usually took a long time before legal systems were changed
Era of the French Revolution
The era of the French Revolution 1790s to 1820s saw serfdom abolished in most of Western Europe while its practice remained common in Eastern Europe for another century or more In France serfdom had been in decline for at least three centuries by the start of the Revolution replaced by various forms of freehold tenancy The last vestiges of serfdom were officially ended on August 4 1789 with a decree abolishing the feudal rights of the nobility
It removed the authority of the manorial courts eliminated tithes and manorial dues and freed those who still remained bound to the land However the decree was mostly symbolic as widespread peasant revolts had effectively ended the feudal system beforehand and ownership of the land still remained in the hands of the landlords who could continue collecting rents and enforcing tenant contracts
In German history the emancipation of the serfs came in 1770-1830 beginning with Schleswig in 1780 Prussia abolished serfdom with the October Edict of 1807 which upgraded the personal legal status of the peasantry and gave them ownership of half or two-thirds of the lands they were working The edict applied to all peasants whose holdings were above a certain size and included both Crown lands and noble estates The peasants were freed from the obligation of personal services to the lord and annual dues in return landowners were given ownership of 1/3 to 1/2 of the land The peasant owned and rented the lands that were deeded to the old owners The other German states imitated Prussia after 1815
In sharp contrast to the violence that characterized land reform in the French Revolution Germany handled it peacefully In Schleswig the peasants who had been influenced by the Enlightenment played an active role elsewhere they were largely passive Indeed for most peasants customs and traditions continued largely unchanged including the old habits of deference to the nobles whose legal authority remained quite strong over the villagers The old paternalistic relationship in East Prussia lasted into the 20th century What was new was that the peasant could now sell his land enabling him to move to the city or buy up the land of his neighbors
The land reforms in northwestern Germany were driven by progressive governments and local elites They abolished feudal obligations and divided collectively owned common land into private parcels and thus created a more efficient market-oriented rural economy It produced increased productivity and population growth It strengthened the traditional social order because wealthy peasants obtained most of the former common land while the rural proletariat was left without land many left for the cities or America Meanwhile the division of the common land served as a buffer preserving social peace between nobles and peasants East of the Elbe River the Junker class maintained large estates and monopolized political power
The eradication of the feudal system marks the beginning of an era of rapid change in Europe The change in status following the enclosure movements beginning in the later 18th century in which various lords abandoned the open field farming of previous centuries and essentially took all the best land for themselves in exchange for freeing their serfs may well have made serfdom seem more desirable to many peasant families
In his book Das Kapital in Chapter 26 entitled The Secret of Primitive Accumulation and Chapter 27 Expropriation of the Agricultural Population from the Land Marx claimed that the feudal relationships of serfdom were violently transformed into private property and free labour free of possession and free to sell their labour force on the market Being liberated from serfdom meant being able to sell one's land and work wherever one desired The so-called primitive accumulation therefore is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer from the means of production It appears as primitive because it forms the pre-historic stage of capital and of the mode of production corresponding with it
In a case history of England Marx described how the serfs became free peasant proprietors and small farmers who were over time forcibly expropriated and driven off the land not true actually the number of people working on the land in England did not peak till 1851 - factory workers came from the expanding population not from people driven off the land in England forming a property-less proletariat He also claimed that more and more legislation was enacted by the state to control and regiment this new class of wage workers In the meantime the remaining farmers became capitalist farmers operating more and more on a commercial basis and gradually legal monopolies preventing trade and investment by entrepreneurs were broken up
Taxes levied by the state took the place of labour dues levied by the lord Although serfdom began its decline in Europe in the Middle Ages it took many hundreds of years to disappear completely In addition the struggles of the working class during the Industrial Revolution can often be compared with the struggles of the serfs during the Middle Ages In parts of the world today forced labour is still used Serfdom is an institution that has always been commonplace for human society however it has not always been of the same nature


Lewis Bryden

Lewis Bryden b 1944 is an artist known for naturalistic landscapes ? mainly of the Connecticut River valley He also paints genre scenes and makes realist sculpture BrydenÅfs plein air paintings include Mexico Cuba Alaska Russia New York and the American West He has exhibited since 1973 at over 20 solo exhibitions and many group shows Formally trained as an architect Bryden is self-taught in the fine arts His style is informed by his interest in rendering different kinds of light Curator Martha Hoppin describes BrydenÅfs method ÅgHe paints the light in space and then fills the space with nature.Åh
Bryden lives in New York City with his wife Elizabeth His daughter Nell Bryden is a singer performing around the UK and Ireland
Bryden maintains studios in New York City and Hadley Massachusetts In Hadley he paints in his home or on a houseboat on the Connecticut River
Background
From an early age Bryden knew he wanted to be an artist When he was nine years old he won second place in a statewide childrenÅfs art competition That same year he sold a watercolor out of a childrenÅfs exhibit at the Norton Museum of Fine Art in West Palm Beach Florida ÅgThat sealed it for me,Åh Bryden remembers He graduated from Yale B.A.1966 and from Graduate School of Design at Harvard M.A 1970 While making a living as an architectural renderer Bryden continued to develop his technique as an artist by going to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City where he spent hours copying masterpieces
ÅgThe best place to study the art that interested me was in the museumÅc I set my easel up in front of one masterpiece after another copying from Velasquez Vermeer Caravaggio Titian Hals and of course Rembrandt I also copied Renoir Monet and Pissarro among the Impressionists It was here that I began to see the common thread of art that moved me and why contemporary art had failed to do so The subjects of these paintings were people from across the ages who were also like us and they were captured in believable human moments.Åh
It wasnÅft until 1988 when Bryden moved to Massachusetts that his dream of supporting himself as a professional artist became a reality He continued to do architectural work but began selling more canvases as area art buyers discovered his paintings of local landscapes ÅgItÅfs a beautiful spot and people like to see things they know That allowed me for the first time to sell enough to live on.Åh
Landscapes
Bryden paints three basic types of landscapes panoramic views waterscapes and architecture in landscape
BrydenÅfs best known works are his panoramic views usually from Mt Holyoke in Hadley Mass In this work he focuses on nature as a paradox Bryden says ÅgNature up close is wild and brutal but from a distance it is serene and ordered.Åh In all of his landscapes he emphasizes nature over man Carl Little in Paintings of New England says ÅgIn his landscapes of the Pioneer Valley of Massachusetts Lewis Bryden has been known to edit out all the accumulated debris of modern life including cars telephone poles and road signs.Åh
A second focus is waterscapes Bryden paints scenes of mountain vistas and the shoreline of the Connecticut river from the waterÅfs surface BrydenÅfs river studio a houseboat he bought as a place to paint allows him to maximize his time working in nature and provides a unique viewpoint
A third category is architecture in landscape BrydenÅfs background as an architect comes through in these works but his depictions have a rich style that uses the light irregular edges and the texture of the paint to portray the buildingÅfs character rather than a strict draftsman-style representation of the form
Most of BrydenÅfs painting is done outdoors which presents the obstacles of varied weather conditions and rapidly changing light In Hadley Mass he paints from his 26-foot pontoon boat called Float des Artistes
ÅgUsually the studio is where you go back to after you find a spot you like This way I can take the studio to the spot I like.Åh Many artists work from a bridge or on the bank Bryden has always preferred to be in the river ÅgThis allows me to be right in the middle of the water and allows me to see things in a different way.Åh When he received a commission from the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston for a 47x54-inch painting on the river he knew he needed to come up with a unique solution He purchased a houseboat from the owner of the Food Bank Farm in Hadley After a few upgrades including replacing the 15-horsepower motor with a 50-horsepower engine and adding some new flooring he was ready to go ÅgI turned the houseboat into a floating studio.Åh
Since light on the river is so variable he has to work quickly ÅgIn about two hours the light has changed so much that I really canÅft continue any more I have to start a new painting and wait until the same time of day for the light to come back.Åh He has developed several methods to overcome the time pressure He takes 15 minutes to mix his colors and then another 15 to sketch the scene on canvas HeÅfll spend two or three hours on the river take a break and then return in the afternoon
Another method he uses is to make a pencil sketch from memory of a view that interests him Later heÅfll revisit the site to add details HeÅfll then transfer the drawings to canvas and sketch the composition in sepia paint Once this is ready he takes the large canvas outside at the same time of day and in the same light conditions as in his memory and he captures the colors Over the summer Bryden will begin 30-50 paintings He later finishes his paintings with the help of his sketches to remind him of the colors in either his Hadley or Manhattan studio
Vision
In an article on Bryden Martha Hoppin speaks highly of his sensitivity
Bryden is a poet He constructs studies of light and air and space ÅeI am not painting a landscape,Åf he says ÅeI am painting a painting.Åf Despite the artist's emphasis on the act of painting he cares deeply about his subject matter He communicates his own joy at being outside in nature and his sense that the world is a satisfying place to live He depicts nature's beauty in its serene and comfortable moments The human element in relation to the landscape does not interest him He does not seek drama and he does not strive for ÅehigherÅf meaning through the use of symbolic motifs His works are most remarkable for their feeling of harmony and serenity and above all for their unaffected naturalness
Painting locations
Havana 2002
In 2002 the US Treasury Department sanctioned BrydenÅfs visit Cuba on an artistic mission He spent five days there and completed a series of plein air paintings
I had permission from the Treasury Department to go to Cuba on a kind of cultural exchange and I intended to use the time to do as many plein air paintings as I could even though I only had five days My impressions were quick and sketchy it is hard to say how much they might have changed with more time spent there Although I do not know a lot about Cuba it has always formed a part of my imagination My youth spent in Florida was filled with stories told by people who had visited it as tourists before the Revolution and by refugees after the Revolution who remembered it as their lost homeland I always had a very vivid image of the island in my mind My short visit there both confirmed and contradicted that vision Now in my mind there are two Cubas?the Cuba imagined or remembered from stories versus the Cuba seen and experienced The tension between the two finally forms a theme for this series of paintings
Colorado
Bryden has taken several painting trips to Colorado and the neighboring states of New Mexico and Arizona He enjoys the spectacular scenery in the mountains and the dramatic seasons
Glacier Bay Basin in Alaska
For an artist who pursues light Alaska is a natural setting Bryden has gone to Glacier Bay Alaska to capture the unusual lighting conditions there In the Alaskan summer painting could be done in natural light from very early morning to nearly the middle of the night
Coney Island
Bryden has painted a series he calls ÅeÅfBoardwalk IdyllÅfÅf that spans over 30 years of work The series which explores the eternal summer of adolescence was exhibited at the Brooklyn Public Library in 2004 and later at the R Michelson Galleries in Northampton Massachusetts In a talk about this series he states ÅgOther artists before me have used Coney Island each in his own way I started studying the work of Reginald Marsh David Levine and the photographer Bruce Davidson My own particular inspiration was a fascination with people in public places who are acting out their private dramas.Åh
One collector of BrydenÅfs work Michael Mao has four of the seriesÅf near life-size paintings displayed in one small room creating the illusion of having walked into a cocktail party where people have already gathered ÅgThe figures are friendly not intimidating so they are a welcome addition to our home,Åh said Mao ÅgWhen Lewis borrows them for an exhibition it is as if some of the family has gone missing.Åh
BrydenÅfs method for these pieces was inspired by the Ågcrust of paintÅh on impressionist Claude MonetÅfs work ÅgWater Lilies.Åh Bryden developed his own textured sculptural-style technique to create the surface texture for his Boardwalk paintings To Ågmimic the atmospheric conditions of a hot summer day,Åh Bryden mixes Neo Megilp with 50% stand oil to coat his canvas He then adds pigment and varnish Ågas much as the canvas will take.Åh
Each painting portrays a moment of interaction or isolation on the boardwalk Bryden describes them ÅgTheyÅfre of tranquility waiting for something to happen.Åh They tell a story ÅgEach of one these is a stand-alone story even though I have no idea what the story is.Åh He captures peopleÅfs interactions ÅgI wanted them to react to each other He goes after the tension that is built when they Ågrecognize that the other person exists.Åh
With the bustle of the Boardwalk Bryden relies on sketches and photographs as well as sessions with live models for his pieces A few paintings were inspired by a box of Kodachrome slides he found of a couple The slides captured scenes similar to the ones he had been painting As there was no way to identify the owners to return the slides he used the images as an inspiration for several pieces
Mexico and American Southwest
Bryden began visiting Mexico annually in 1993 During his visits he does informal portraits and sketches in the public squares capturing plein air impressions of the moment In 1994 he put his work together into a series ÅgTierra InsolitaÅh which was formally presented in exhibition at the ÅeÅfGalleria IxcateopanÅfÅf in Acapulco in that same year
Acapulco is his home base during these visits but he takes trips with friends to remote mountainous areas of Guerrero During one of these trips he decided to do a series on the average everyday person living in Mexico
Writer Stephen Lockwood describes these paintings ÅgEvery picture in the series is very direct there is little for the eye to focus on other than the facial characteristic of the subject The directional gaze of each sitter is varied some look directly at the viewer others look off to the left or to the right The different position of each head has the effect of changing how engaged or disengaged each portrait is with the observer.Åh
Portraits
While Bryden has done many portraits he does not consider himself a portrait artist and has never taken a commission for a portrait He usually paints friends and family and occasional professional models He has done a few self-portraits but they have rarely been exhibited
Bryden is very interested in the relationships and stories of people he paints He is attracted to stories of artists and the relationships they have with the muses that inspire them
Sculpture
As with the rest of his art BrydenÅfs sculpting technique is mainly self-taught He has recently been doing more sculpture having entered this mode after he learned one of his models was allergic to turpentine His time with the model was limited and he wanted to capture her features so he turned to the medium of clay He later learned the process of bronze sculpture and stone carving His most recent commission Nature as Muse is a life-size bronze in the Mallinckrodt Garden at the art center called View in Old Forge NY
Awards and Collections
Beginning early in his career Bryden received numerous awards such as the Silvermine Guild Award first prize 1985 Carolyn Lanchner juror and Mid Hudson Arts Competition 1985 second prize Barbara Haskell juror
In 2009 the Springfield Art Museums acquired two Bryden landscapes?ÅeÅfThe Beginning of the DayÅfÅf and ÅeÅfThe End of The DayÅfÅf


Cycling in Azerbaijan

The history of cycling in Azerbaijan began in 1930 as it was this year the first bicycles were imported from Russia
Initially bikes were popular among pupils and students and in the 40s they became widely used by almost entire population without exception The same year the first amateur bicycle race was launched and was held every four years 10 years later the first professional racers begin to perform in Azerbaijan - Sabzali Museyibov and Zargarli Hussein who later became a pioneer in the training of professional cyclists Azerbaijan
In the second half of the 20th century female cycling has actively developed ? both individual tournaments and mixed tournaments were organized for women In the same period a mixed team of cyclists from Baku won several local races and represented Azerbaijan at the Union and trans-Caucasian races

Reception
The album has received mixed reviews Simon Harper of Clash magazine said Shades of light and dark ripple throughout and keep the listener guessing On Soul Love Liam Gallagher's cosmic vibe is matched by the first distinct stamp of producer David Sitek's ambient adventuring which commandeers the second-half of the song letting it drift dreamily skywards This is what permeates BE making it sonically enchanting In a 4/5 review from Daily Express they said Second Bite of the Apple is a complex soulful shuffle arguably the most Lennon-esque piece Gallagher has recorded Soon Come Tomorrow a truly great pop tune with phased guitar and I'm Just Saying an exercise in sheer exuberance with a counted-off refrain that will be echoing around a stadium near you soon NME gave BE a 7/10 review and remarked that BE is certainly an improvement on Different Gear Still Speeding but it's more of a tentative step in the right direction than a great leap forward

Queen of Trumps

Queen of Trumps 1832?1843 was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare best known for winning the classic Oaks and St Leger Stakes in 1835 becoming the first horse to win both races In a racing career which lasted from October 1834 until October 1836 she won ten of her eleven races After being successful in her only race as a two-year-old she defeated the 1000 Guineas winner Preserve in the Oaks on her three-year-old debut Later that year she started favourite for the St Leger and won from a field which included Preserve and the Epsom Derby winner Mundig Queen of Trumps sustained her only defeat a few days later when she was attacked by a dog in the closing stages of the Scarborough Stakes She was retired to stud after winning all four of her races in 1836 Queen of Trumps died in 1843 at the age of eleven She was described by a contemporary writer as certainly the most extraordinary mare these our days have seen
Background
Queen of Trumps was a dark brown mare with a white blaze and three white socks bred by her owner Edward Lloyd-Mostyn She was sired by Velocipede a highly regarded but injury-prone racehorse who also sired the Derby winner Amato and the 2000 Guineas winner Meteor
She was the sixth and probably the last foal produced by Mostyn's mare Princess Royal a daughter of Castrel Princess Royal was a successful racehorse winning eight races in northern England as a three-year-old in 1821 Queen of Trumps was ridden in all of her races by Thomas Tommy Lye
Racing career
1834 two-year-old season
Queen of Trumps began her racing career at Holywell Hunt meeting in Flintshire North Wales on 14 October 1834 Racing the in Champagne Stakes over half a mile she won from three opponents meaning that Mostyn under the conditions of the race was obliged to present two dozen bottles of champagne to the members of the local racing club
1835 three-year-old season
Queen of Trumps did not run as a three-year-old until 5 June when she was one of ten fillies to contest the fifty-seventh running of the Oaks Stakes at Epsom Downs Racecourse The odds-on favourite for the race was Preserve the undefeated winner of the 1000 Guineas but Queen of Trumps despite her lack of public form and looking less than fully fit was well-supported and went off the 7/1 second choice in the betting The race began after one false start and was run at a moderately strong pace By the time the runners entered the straight many of them were already struggling and inside the final quarter mile the first and second favourites broke clear of the opposition and appeared to have the race between them Approaching the final furlong Queen of Trumps shot forward left Preserve well behind and cantered to victory The New Sporting Magazine praised Tommy Lye for his steady riding performance and opined that he had done only enough to win the race leaving the filly's true ability undisclosed
The Oaks winner's next appearance was at Liverpool Racecourse on 17 July She started favourite for the Knowsley Dinner Stakes and won from the colts Hectic Equator and Conductor
In the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in September Queen of Trumps met Preserve again along with Mundig and Ascot colts who had finished first and second in the Derby The meeting was held in generally fine weather and attracted a large crowd with much interest being created by the attendance of the heir to the throne Princess Victoria Despite rumours that she would be made safe prevented from winning Queen of Trumps started favourite ahead of Hornsea the Derby winner's reportedly superior stable companion The favourite was not among the early front-runners but Lye moved steadily forward and positioned her just behind the leaders in the straight Approaching the final furlong the filly accelerated sharply settled the race in two or three strides and won without the semblance of an effort by a length from Hornsea and Sheet Anchor with Preserve in fourth place She became the first Oaks winner to add a success in the St Leger and was the only winner of Epsom classic to take the race between Champion in 1800 and Surplice in 1848
Three days later at the same course Queen of Trumps was made 1/10 favourite for the one mile Scarborough Stakes despite carrying a seven pound weight penalty for her classic victory She was given a tender ride by Lye as her delicate legs were reportedly causing her discomfort but looked likely to win inside the final furlong when a large bulldog rushed out from the crowd Lye managed to avoid the attacking animal but Queen of Trumps lost ground and momentum and was beaten half a head by the colt Ainderby Later the same sfternoon Queen of Trumps was allowed to walk over for a sweepstakes over the St Leger course and distance
Queen of Trumps returned to Holywell for her final appearance of the season On 13 October she walked over for the Chieftain Stakes over the Mostyn mile course after the two other entries were withdrawn
1836 four-year-old season
Queen of Trumps began her third and final season with two appearances at Chester Racecourse in early May She won the Stand Cup beating the five-year-old Red Rover and then walked over for the Marquis of Westminster's Plate a day later In June the filly appeared at Newton-le-Willows Racecourse and won the Borough Cup over two miles beating Mr Ramsay's horse Vestment at odds of 1/6 Queen of Trumps racing career ended as it had begun with a race at the Holywell Hunt in October when she defeated Lord Westminster's four-year-old Oswald in a two-mile Post Sweepstakes
Stud career
Queen of Trumps was retired from racing to become a broodmare at her owners stud She produced only four foals
In 1843 Queen of Trumps died giving birth to a foal by Revolution
Princess Alice had some success as a broodmare and was the direct ancestor of many good winners including two Irish classic winners and the leading Canadian stallion Chop Chop

John Rattray surgeon

John Rattray 22 September 1707 ? 5 July 1771 was an Edinburgh surgeon who served as surgeon to Prince Charles Edward Stuart during the Jacobite rising of 1745 He was a proficient archer winning the Edinburgh Arrow on two occasions but it is for his golfing achievements that he is principally remembered A skilful golfer Rattray won the first competition organised by the Company of Gentleman Golfers later the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers to become the Captain of Goff for a year In this capacity he signed the first ever Rules of Golf
Early life
John Rattray was born on 22 September 1707 in Craighall Castle the family seat of Clan Rattray near the village of Blairgowrie and Rattray in Perthshire Scotland His father the Rt Rev Dr Thomas Rattray 1684?1743 was an Episcopalian clergyman who became Bishop of Dunkeld then of Brechin and was elected Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church On his death in 1743 his elder son James became clan chief and inherited the estate As the second son John Rattray had no such inheritance and he trained as a surgeon in Edinburgh by apprenticeship to the surgeon John Semple between 1728 and 1735 when he began surgical practice in Edinburgh To enhance his professional status he applied to become a freeman or fellow of the Incorporation of Surgeons of Edinburgh later the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh This involved sitting a series of four examinations which were held in the later months of 1740 and having passed these he was admitted a freeman of the Incorporation in November 1740
Sporting activities
Rattray joined the Royal Company of Archers in 1731 and won the archery competition for the silver punch bowl on 4 occasions 1732 1735 1740 and 1742 The Company's most prestigious prize the Edinburgh Arrow or Silver Arrow was presented to the Company by Edinburgh Town Council in 1709 as a prize for an annual archery competition Rattray won this twice in 1735 and 1744 He was also a skilled golfer and his prowess at golf is recorded in this extract from the mock heroic poem The Goff by Rev Thomas Mathison 1720?1760 published in 1743 the first poem devoted to the sport of golf
The ÅefamÅfd fieldÅf referred to is Leith Links an area of links grassland in the burgh of Leith where the self-styled Company of Gentleman Golfers began to golf regularly The great Forbes mentioned is Duncan Forbes of Culloden 1685?1747),Lord President of the Court of Session Scotland's most senior law officer and one of Rattray's regular golfing companions Their friendship was to save Rattray's life
The Gentleman Golfers had approached the Edinburgh Town Council asking them to donate a silver club to be played for in an annual golf competition over Leith Links in much the same way as the Council provided the silver arrow for archery competitions The Town Council approved this request on 7 March 1744 and published the Regulations for the competition These were to do with the administration of the competition indicating that the draw should be made from a bonnet that it should be open to any golfer from Great Britain & Ireland and that clerks should mark down each stroke In their document the Council note that the golfers have already drawn up the Articles and Laws in playing at golf',and these the original rules of golf were used for this competition The competition was played over five holes at Leith Links Sawmill 414yds North-mid 461 yds East 426 yds South-mid 495 yds and Thorntree 435 yds It is likely that they played three rounds of this course On 2 April 1744 Rattray won the first competition held over this course,winning the silver club and earning the title ÅeCaptain of the GoffÅf It is RattrayÅfs signature that appears below the 13 original rules of golf recorded in the minute book of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers It is not clear whether he signed this in his capacity as captain of the golf or as the author of the rules As was customary for entries in the minutes he has written Cptn after his signature which some commentators have interpreted as indicating that he simply signed the minute as captain the rules having been a joint effort of the golfers who included some of the best legal brains in Scotland The rules signed by Rattray lay undisturbed in the minute book of the Honourable Company for some 200 years until discovered there by the golf historian CB Clapcott in 1937 The rules are now in the collection of the National Library of Scotland The St Andrews golfers adopted them with minor modifications in 1754 and they still form the basis of many of the modern laws of the game These original rules of golf comprised 12 general rules and one local rule applicable to the Leith course
Role in the 1745 Jacobite rising
On 19 August 1745 Prince Charles Edward Stuart raised his standard at Glenfinnan marking the start of his attempt to claim the British throne To gather support he asked clans and families likely to be sympathetic to join his cause As prominent Episcopalians the Rattrays were likely supporters but James Rattray by then the clan chief opted to donate Åí50 rather than join the standard John Rattray joined the Jacobite army just after their victory at the Battle of Prestonpans on 21 September when the call went out to Edinburgh surgeons to care for the wounded Amongst those who responded to the call were Alexander Monro(a staunch Hanoverian and Alexander Lang Sandy Wood Rattray rode the five miles from his house at South Foulis Close near the foot of Edinburgh's High Street with his colleague John Lauder Deacon president of the Incorporation of Surgeons Lauder later claimed that they had treated some 300 wounded and accommodated many of these at their own expense but as this claim was made as part of a plea for his life it may well have been exaggerated Rattray stayed with the Jacobite army as it advanced into England then retreated from Derby eventually becoming Surgeon-general and personal surgeon to Prince Charles After the battle of Culloden Rattray surrendered to the Hanoverians and was imprisoned in Inverness,but he and Lauder were not allowed to treat the wounded among their fellow prisoners
Robert Forbes bishop of Ross and Caithness in his detailed contemporary account of events of the 45 rising The Lyon in Mourning describes how Rattray was taunted by a Hanoverian officer ÅgWe know well what you are sir the PretenderÅfs surgeon If anyone hangs you shall.Åh Rattray's golfing companion Lord Forbes a staunch Hanoverian made a personal plea of intercession on behalf of Rattray to the Duke of Cumberland which was successful as was a subsequent plea for Lauder They were freed but Cumberland ordered that they be rearrested in Edinburgh and they were held in London until January 1747 when they were finally released having signed an oath of obedience to the King
Later life
Rattray returned to surgical practice in Edinburgh and to golf In 1751 he again won the golf competition for the silver club and continued to practice as a surgeon until at least 1766 He died at Edinburgh on 5 July 1771
Epilogue
In 2013 the Leith Rules Golf Society obtained planning permission to erect a statue of John Rattray on Leith Links and commissioned the sculptor David Annand for the project

Boston Marathon bombings

The Boston Marathon bombings and subsequent related shootings were a series of attacks and incidents which began on April 15 2013 when two pressure cooker bombs exploded during the Boston Marathon at killing 3 people and injuring an estimated 264 others The bombs exploded about 12 seconds and apart near the finish line on Boylston Street The suspects were then identified as two brothers whose family had immigrated to the United States as refugees around 2002 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev born on October 21 1986 and killed on April 19 2013 and 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev born on July 22 1993
MIT shooting and carjacking
A few hours after the photos were released the suspects allegedly shot Sean A Collier of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department multiple times killing him for his gun which they could not get out because of the holster's retention system Collier aged 27 was seated in his police car near the Stata Center Building 32 on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus He was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital in nearby downtown Boston where he was pronounced dead Some law enforcement officials described the killing as an assassination
The duo then allegedly carjacked a Mercedes-Benz M-Class SUV in the Allston-Brighton neighborhood of Boston Tamerlan took the owner hostage and told him that he was responsible for the Boston bombings and for killing a police officer Dzhokhar followed them in the green Honda later joining them in the Mercedes-Benz Later interrogation allegedly revealed that the brothers decided spontaneously that they wanted to go to New York and bomb Times Square
The suspects forced the hostage to use his ATM cards to obtain $800 in cash until the daily cash withdrawal limit was reached They transferred objects to the Mercedes-Benz and one brother followed it in their Honda Civic for which an all-points bulletin was issued The car's owner Danny a Chinese national escaped while the suspects stopped at a gas station he ran across the street to another gas station asking the clerk to call 911 His cellphone remained in the vehicle allowing the police to focus their search on Watertown
Firefight with police
Shortly after midnight on April 19 a Watertown police officer identified the brothers in a Honda Civic and the stolen SUV and a ferocious gunfight followed on the 100 block of Laurel St between the brothers and police arriving at the scene An estimated 200?300 rounds of ammunition were fired and at least one further bomb and several crude grenades were thrown
According to Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau the brothers had an arsenal of guns Also according to Deveau the older brother Tamerlan ran out of ammunition and was tackled and apprehended by police while the younger brother Dzhokhar drove the stolen SUV toward police and over Tamerlan dragging him a short distance down the street Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sped off but about a half-mile away at the corner of Spruce and Lincoln streets he abandoned the car and escaped on foot
Upon searching the scene only one firearm a Ruger 9mm pistol with a defaced serial number was recovered --> Within a 10-minute span officers fired many rounds peppering the area and leaving over a dozen nearby houses with scores of bullet holes Tamerlan Tsarnaev was transported to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center where he was pronounced dead on April 19 at 1:35?a.m The emergency room doctors said that he did not appear to have been run over
According to the death certificate Tsarnaev's cause of death was gunshot wounds of torso and extremities blunt trauma to head and torso and shot by police then run over and dragged by motor vehicle The death was ruled a homicide
During the firefight 33-year-old MBTA Police Officer Richard H Donohue Jr was also critically wounded by what may have been friendly fire He was taken to Mount Auburn Hospital where he was in critical but stable condition Fifteen other police officers sustained minor injuries during the firefight A 50-page report on the manhunt produced by Harvard Kennedy School's Program on Crisis Leadership found that a lack of coordination between the too many police agencies involved put the public at excessive risk during the shootout
Manhunt and capture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev
The FBI released additional photos of the two during the Watertown incident Early on April 19 Watertown residents received reverse 911 calls asking them to stay indoors On the morning of April 19 Governor Patrick asked residents of Watertown and adjacent cities and towns Allston-Brighton Boston Belmont Brookline Cambridge Newton and Waltham to shelter in place Somerville residents also received a reverse-911 call with orders to shelter in place
A 20-block area of Watertown was cordoned off and residents were told not to leave their homes or answer the door as officers in tactical gear scoured the area Helicopters circled the area and SWAT teams in armored vehicles moved through in formation with officers going door-to-door On the scene were the FBI the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives the Department of Homeland Security the National Guard the Boston and Watertown Police departments and the Massachusetts State Police The show of force was the first major field test of the interagency task forces created in the wake of the September 11 attacks
The entire public transit network as well as most Boston taxi service was suspended as was Amtrak service to and from Boston Logan International Airport remained open under heightened security Universities schools many businesses and other facilities were closed as thousands of law enforcement personnel participated in an unprecedented door-to-door manhunt in Watertown as well as following up other leads including at the house the brothers shared in Cambridge Seven improvised explosive devices were recovered by bomb squads
The father of the suspected Boston Marathon bombers speaking from his home in Makhachkala Dagestan encouraged his son to Give up Give up You have a bright future ahead of you Come home to Russia He continued If they killed him then all hell would break loose On television Dzhokhar's uncle from Montgomery Village Maryland pleaded with him to turn himself in
The manhunt ended on the evening of April 19 two hours after the shelter-in-place order had been lifted Outside the search area a Watertown resident stepped outside and noticed that the cover on his boat in his back yard was loose He looked into the boat and saw a body lying in a pool of blood and he promptly notified police Authorities surrounded the boat and verified movement through a forward looking infrared thermal imaging device in a State Police helicopter When the suspect started poking at the tarp of the boat police began a large volume of gunfire at the boat stopping only after the Superintendent on the scene called for a cease fire Celebrations followed law enforcement's capture of Tsarnaev
According to Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis and Watertown Police Chief Deveau Tsarnaev was shooting from inside the boat at police exchanging fire for an hour After he was captured Tsarnaev was found not to have any weapons He was taken into custody at 8:42?pm and transported to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center where he was listed in critical condition with multiple gunshot wounds to the head neck legs and hand Initial reports that the neck wound was from a self-inflicted gunshot from a possible suicide attempt were later contradicted by the revelation that he was unarmed at the time of capture and a description of the neck wound by SWAT team members that the neck wound was a slicing injury possibly caused by shrapnel from an explosion
Legal proceedings
Interrogation
United States Senators Kelly Ayotte Saxby Chambliss Lindsey Graham and John McCain and Representative Peter T King suggested that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev a U.S citizen should be tried as an unlawful enemy combatant rather than as a criminal potentially preventing him from obtaining legal counsel Other sources including Alan Dershowitz a prominent American legal scholar and lawyer said that doing so would be illegal and would jeopardize the prosecution The government decided to try Dzhokhar in the federal criminal court system and not as an enemy combatant
Dzhokhar was questioned for 16 hours by investigators but stopped communicating with them on the night of April 22 after Judge Marianne Bowler read him a Miranda warning Dzhokhar had not previously been given a Miranda warning as federal law enforcement officials invoked the warning's public safety exception This raised doubts whether the suspect's statements during this investigation would be admissible as evidence and led to a debate surrounding Miranda rights
Charges and detention
On April 22 formal criminal charges were brought against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts during a bedside hearing while he was hospitalized He was charged with use of a weapon of mass destruction and with malicious destruction of property resulting in death The charges carry potential sentences of life imprisonment or the death penalty Tsarnaev was judged to be awake mentally competent and lucid and he responded to most questions by nodding When the judge asked him whether he was able to afford an attorney he responded no he is represented by the Federal Public Defender's office On April 26 Dzhohkar Tsarnaev was moved from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to the Federal Medical Center at Fort Devens about from Boston FMC Devens is a federal prison medical facility at a former Army base where he is being held in solitary confinement at a segregated housing unit with 23-hour-per-day lockdown
On July 10 Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to 30 charges in his first public court appearance including a murder charge for MIT police officer Sean Collier He was back in court for a status hearing on September 23 and his lawyers requested more time to prepare their defense On October 2 Tsarnaev's attorneys asked the court to lift the special administrative measures SAMs imposed by Attorney General Holder in August saying the measures had left Tsarnaev unduly isolated from communication with his family and lawyers and that no evidence suggests he poses a future threat
Trial
A trial in federal court was scheduled for November 3 2014 Attorneys for Tsarnaev asked for a change of venue from Boston to Washington D.C a move that was opposed by prosecutors
Judge George O'Toole ruled on September 24 2014 that the trial will begin on January 5 2015 two months later than planned because a large amount of evidence needed to be examined by both sides He said the defense motion for a lengthier delay until September 2015 was not warranted He also ruled that the defense had failed to demonstrate that media coverage had so inflamed and pervasively prejudiced the area jury pool that a fair and impartial jury could not be empaneled in the district refusing their request for a change of venue to Washington D.C On December 18 2014 Tsarnaev attended a pre-trial hearing his first time in public since July 2013
Motives and backgrounds
According to FBI interrogators Dzhokhar and his brother were motivated by extremist Islamic beliefs and were not connected to any known terrorist groups instead learning to build explosive weapons from an online magazine published by al-Qaeda affiliates in Yemen It is further alleged that and his brother considered suicide attacks and striking on the Fourth of July but ultimately decided to use pressure cooker bombs capable of remote detonation and other IEDs Fox News reported that the brothers chose the prestigious race as a target of opportunity the building of the bombs came together more quickly than expected
Dzhokhar said he and his brother wanted to defend Islam from the U.S which conducted the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan in the view of the brothers against Muslims Later a CBS report revealed that a note scrawled by Dzhokhar with a marker on the interior wall of the boat where he was hiding said the bombings were retribution for U.S military action in Afghanistan and Iraq and called the Boston victims collateral damage in the same way innocent victims have been collateral damage in U.S wars around the world According to The New York Times the portion of the boat's interior with the note would likely be cut from the hull with permission from the owner and presented in court as evidence
Despite the seemingly outwardly religious motivation of the Tsarnaev brothers some political science and public policy scholars suggest that Islam may have played only a secondary role in the attacks Sympathy towards the political aspirations in the Caucasus region and Tamerlan's inability to become fully integrated into American society appear to be the primary motives in their opinion According to The Los Angeles Times a law enforcement official said Dzhokhar did not seem as bothered about America's role in the Muslim world as his brother Tamerlan had been Dzhokhar identified Tamerlan as the driving force behind the bombings and said that his brother had only recently recruited him to help
Tamerlan Tsarnaev was born in 1986 in the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic North Caucasus Dzhokhar was born in 1993 in Kyrgyzstan although some reports say his family claims he was born in Dagestan The family spent time in Tokmok Kyrgyzstan and in Makhachkala Dagestan
They are half Chechen through their father Anzor and half Avar through their mother Zubeidat Although they never lived in Chechnya the brothers self-identified as Chechen
The Tsarnaev family emigrated in 2002 to the United States where they applied for refugee status settling in Cambridge Massachusetts Tamerlan Tsarnaev attended Bunker Hill Community College but dropped out to become a boxer His goal was a place on the U.S Olympic boxing team saying that unless his native Chechnya becomes independent he would rather compete for the United States than for Russia He was married on July 15 2010 in the Masjid Al Quran Mosque in Dorchester to a U.S citizen Katherine Russell who was pregnant with their daughter He stated that he didn't understand Americans and had not a single American friend He had a history of violence including an arrest in July 2009 for assaulting his then girlfriend
The brothers are Muslim with Tamerlan's aunt stating that he had recently become a devout Muslim Tamerlan in the three years before his death became more devout and religious and a YouTube channel in his name linked to Salafist and Islamist videos The FBI was informed by the Russian Federal Security Service FSB in 2011 that he was a follower of radical Islam In response the FBI interviewed Tamerlan and his family and searched databases but did not find any evidence of terrorism activity domestic or foreign During the 2012 trip to Dagestan Tamerlan was reportedly a frequent visitor at a mosque on Kotrova Street in Makhachkala believed by the FSB to be linked with radical Islam Some experts believe they were motivated by their faith apparently an anti-American radical version of Islam acquired in the U.S while others believe the turn to radicalism happened in Dagestan
At the time of the bombing Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth with a major in marine biology Dzhokhar became a naturalized U.S citizen on September 11 2012 Tamerlan's boxing coach reported to NBC that the young brother was greatly affected by his brother and admired him
Tamerlan Tsarnaev was previously connected but at the time not a suspect to the triple homicide in Waltham Massachusetts on the evening of September 11 2011 Brendan Mess Erik Weissman and Raphael Teken were murdered in Mess apartment All had their throats slit from ear to ear with such great force that they were nearly decapitated The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other and that the murders were not random Tamerlan Tsarnaev had previously described murder victim Brendan Mess as his best friend After the bombings and subsequent revelations of Tsarnaev's personal life the Waltham murders case was reexamined in April 2013 with Tsarnaev as a new suspect Both ABC and The New York Times have reported that there is strong evidence that implicate Tsarnaev for this triple homicide
Some analysts claim the Tsarnaev brothers mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is a radical extremist and supporter of jihad who influenced her sons behavior This prompted the Russian government to warn the U.S government about the family's behavior on two occasions Both Tamerlan and his mother were placed on a terrorism watch list about 18 months before the bombing took place
According to a Wall Street Journal report citing statements by anonymous US officials Russia withheld information from U.S intelligence after its initial warning after which it denied U.S requests for more information
Other arrests and detentions
On April 15 several people who were near the scene of the blast and the surrounding area were taken into custody and questioned about the bombings including a Saudi man whom police stopped as he was walking away from the explosion and detained when some of his responses to questions made them uncomfortable Law enforcement searched his residence in a Boston suburb CNN later reported that he was found to have no connection to the attack an unnamed U.S official said he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time
On the night of April 18 two men riding in a taxi in the vicinity of the shootout were arrested and released shortly thereafter when police determined they were not involved in the Marathon attacks Another man was arrested several blocks from the site of the shootout and was forced to strip naked by police who feared he might have concealed explosives He was released that evening after a brief investigation determined that he was an innocent bystander
On May 22 the FBI interrogated Ibragim Todashev a Chechen from Boston in Orlando Florida During the interrogation he was shot and killed by an FBI officer who claimed that Todashev attacked him The New York Times quoted an unnamed law enforcement official as saying that Todashev had confessed to the 2011 Waltham murders and implicated Tsarnaev as well However the father of Ibragim Todashev claims that his son is innocent and that federal investigators are biased against Chechens and made up their case against him

Phillipos Kadyrbayev Tazhayakov and Tsarnaev entered the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth in the fall of 2011 and knew each other well After seeing photos of the as-yet unidentified Tsarnaev on television the three men are alleged to have traveled to Tsarnaev's dorm room where they retrieved a backpack and laptop belonging to Tsarnaev The backpack was discarded but Police recovered the backpack and contents in a nearby New Bedford landfill on April 26 During interviews the men initially denied visiting the dorm room but later admitted their actions
On August 8 2013 Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice This was after allegedly helping Dzhokhar Tsarnaev dispose of a laptop fireworks and a backpack after the bombings If convicted each would face up to 25 years in prison and they also could be deported On July 21 2014 Azamat Tazhayakov was convicted of obstruction of justice and conspiracy

Russian reaction
The Russian government said special attention would be paid to security at upcoming international sports events in Russia including the 2014 Winter Olympics According to the Russian embassy in the U.S President Vladimir Putin condemned the bombing as a barbaric crime and stressed that the Russian Federation will be ready if necessary to assist in the U.S authorities investigation He urged closer cooperation of security services with Western partners
Senator Saxby Chambliss and Republican Richard Burr reported that Russian authorities had separately asked both the FBI at least twice during March and November 2011 and the CIA September 2011 to look carefully into Tamerlan Tsarnaev and provide more information about him back to Russia
But Russian authorities and mass media blame U.S authorities for negligence because the authorities were warned by Russian counterparts several times long before the bombing happened Moreover Russian authorities and mass media since the spring of 2014 blame USA for politicaly motivated false information about lack of response from Russian authorities after subsequent U.S requests As a proof a letter from Russian Federal Security Service FSB were shown to the members of U.S Congressmen official delegation to Moscow during their visit This letter with information about Tsarnaev including his biography details connections and phone number has been sent from FSB to FBI and CIA during March 2011
Chechen reactions
On April 19 2013 the press-secretary of the head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov issued a statement that inter alia read The Boston bombing suspects have nothing to do with Chechnya On the same day Kadyrov was reported by The Guardian to have written on Instagram
Any attempt to make a link between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs if they are guilty is in vain They grew up in the U.S their views and beliefs were formed there The roots of evil must be searched for in America The whole world must battle with terrorism We know this better than anyone We wish recover to all the victims and share Americans feeling of sorrow
Akhmed Zakayev head of the secular wing of the Chechen separatist movement now in exile in London condemned the bombings as terrorist and expressed condolences to the families of the victims Zakayev denied that the bombers were in any way representative of the Chechen people saying that the Chechen people never had and can not have any hostile feelings toward the United States and its citizens
The Mujahideen of the Caucasus Emirate Province of Dagestan the Caucasian Islamist organization in both Chechnya and Dagestan denied any link to the bombing or the Tsarnaev brothers and stated that it was at war with Russia not the United States It also said that it had sworn off violence against civilians since 2012
Criticism of lockdown
The day-long lockdown was criticized as being an overreaction by some Michael Cohen of The Observer said that Americans have little experience with daily terrorism compared to some countries and are more primed to assume the absolute worst He wrote that it was not the first time dangerous murderers have been on the loose in a large American city naming Christopher Dorner in February 2013 and the Beltway sniper attacks in October 2002 yet in none of the previous cases had a lockdown been used Moreover critics including Thomas R Eddlem of The New American Sean Collins of Spiked and former Presidential candidate Ron Paul said that martial law does not work noting that the suspect was not found until the curfew was lifted Paul characterized the lockdown as a violation of civil liberties
Haaretz"s Chemi Salev wrote that in terms of cost-benefit analysis from the evil terrorist's point of view the Boston Street bombings and their aftermath can only be viewed as a resounding triumph since the relatively amateurish terrorists managed to intimidate a vast number of people and got a maximum amount of publicity In The New York Times Ross Douthat commented about Salev's thoughts that the massive manhunt operation just might deter other amateur terrorists but not hard-core terrorists such as Mohammed Atta Douthat argued that out-of-the-ordinary measures can only be used when terrorism itself is out-of-the-ordinary if attacks started to occur more often people would not be as willing to comply with shelter in place commands yet once a terrorist has been hunted with such an operation it is hard to justify why such measures should not be taken the next time
Conflicting reports
On the afternoon of the bombings The New York Post reported that a suspect a Saudi Arabian male was under guard and being questioned at a Boston hospital That evening Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said that there had not been an arrest The Post did not retract its story about the suspect leading to widespread reports by CBS News CNN and other media that a Middle Eastern suspect was in custody The day after the bombing a majority of outlets were reporting that the Saudi was a witness not a suspect
The New York Post on its April 18 front page showed two men and said they were being sought by the authorities The two were not the ones being sought as suspects They were a 17-year-old boy and his track coach The boy from Revere Massachusetts turned himself over to the police immediately and was cleared after a 20-minute interview in which they advised him to deactivate his Facebook account New York Post editor Col Allan stated We stand by our story The image was emailed to law enforcement agencies yesterday afternoon seeking information about these men as our story reported We did not identify them as suspects The two were implied to be possible suspects via crowdsourcing on the websites Reddit and 4chan
Several other people were mistakenly identified as suspects Two of those wrongly identified as suspects on Reddit were a 17-year-old track star and Sunil Tripathi a Brown University student missing since March Tripathi was found dead on April 23 in the Providence River
On April 17 the FBI released the following statement
The decision to release the photos of the Tsarnaev brothers was made in part to limit damage done to those misidentified on the Internet and by the media and to address concerns over maintaining control of the manhunt
BBC News reported that the initial announcements from the authorities had been praised for using language with care and deliberation to avoid victimization of religious minorities but that a xenophobic undercurrent in the American response to the tragedy was shown by some comments on social networking websites

Reception
Resty Woro Yuniar of Wall Street Journal Southeast Asia gave the film three and a half stars out of 5 writing while the plot is predictable the movie does give a viewer a good feel and notes the movie does a fairly good job of capturing Indonesian traditions
Jeff Bounds from Dallas Business Journal noted that the lighting the special effects and the cinematography looked like it came straight out of Hollywood rather than Indonesia
Andrew Skeates from Blueprint Review gives it 3 out of 5 stars and notes that it delivers its fair share of bone crunching and bullet riddled action scenes From an extended chase through the back alleys of Java which features several painful looking motorcycle stunts to several hard hitting shootouts and a particularly memorable bit with a rocket launcher Java Heat dishes out some thrilling action beats which have a distinctive old school feel about them

West Fertilizer Company explosion

On April 17 2013 an ammonium nitrate explosion occurred at the West Fertilizer Company storage and distribution facility in West Texas eighteen miles 29?km north of Waco while emergency services personnel were responding to a fire at the facility Fifteen people were killed more than 160 were injured and more than 150 buildings were damaged or destroyed Investigators have confirmed that ammonium nitrate was the material that exploded but the cause of the initial fire is as yet unknown
Background
West Fertilizer Company has supplied chemicals to farmers since it was founded in 1962 it is owned by Adair Grain Inc and employed nine workers at the facility
The plant was last inspected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA in 1985 According to records obtained by the Associated Press OSHA cited the plant for improper storage of anhydrous ammonia and fined it $30 OSHA could have imposed a fine of as much as $1,000 OSHA also cited the plant for violations of respiratory protection standards but they did not issue fines Occupational Safety and Health Administration officials said the facility was not on their National Emphasis Plan for inspections because it was not a manufacturer had no record of a major accident and the Environmental Protection Agency did not consider it a major risk After a complaint in 2006 about an ammonia smell coming from the facility the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality investigated and cited the operator for not having obtained a permit for its two storage tanks containing anhydrous ammonia A permit was issued once the operators brought the facility into accord with the regulations and recommendations made by the agency Also in 2006 the EPA fined the owners $2,300 for problems that included a failure to file a risk management program plan on time In June 2012 the U.S Department of TransportationÅfs Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration further fined the facility $5,250 for violations regarding its storage of anhydrous ammonia
According to an open records request by Reuters the plant had a long history of minor thefts presumably by people wanting to use anhydrous ammonia to make methamphetamine Despite this the facility lacked burglar alarms or even a fenced perimeter Following recommendations by law enforcement a surveillance system was installed in 2009
In an emergency planning report filed with the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA in 2011 company officials stated the ammonia storage tanks did not represent a significant fire or explosion hazard The tanks were still intact following the fire and explosion
According to its last filing with the EPA in late 2012 the company stated that it stored of ammonium nitrate and of anhydrous ammonia on the site A week after the explosion Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told Senate investigators that the company did not appear to have disclosed its ammonium nitrate stock to her department Federal law requires that the Department of Homeland Security DHS be notified whenever anyone has more than one ton of ammonium nitrate on hand or if the ammonium nitrate is combined with combustible material
Fire and explosion
The facility caught fire on Wednesday April 17 2013 then exploded as firefighters were attempting to douse the flames The cause of the initial fire remains unknown authorities ruled out weather natural causes anhydrous ammonium and ammonium nitrate in a rail car as possible causes of the fire
The explosion occurred about 7:50:38 p.m CDT 00:50 UTC April 18
Aftermath
As a result of the massive explosion the West Fertilizer Company plant was obliterated and heavy damage and further destruction was caused to surrounding areas Numbers for people dead or injured varied initially
Damage
In addition to the obliterated plant the damaged buildings included the public West Middle School which sits next to the facility A neighboring 50-unit two-story apartment building was destroyed
The blast damaged the nearby West Rest Haven nursing home and many residents were evacuated Many of the nursing home residents received cuts from flying glass but emergency personnel on scene judged that most of these injuries were not life-threatening
On April 20 some residents who tried to return to their destroyed homes were turned away because leaking gas tanks were causing small fires
According to the company's insurer United States Fire Insurance of Morristown New Jersey the facility was only covered by $1 million in liability insurance According to official estimates from both state and company officials this amount will not even begin to cover the cost of damages Furthermore according to The Dallas Morning News Texas law allows fertilizer storage facilities to operate without any liability insurance at all even when they store hazardous materials
Injuries and fatalities
West Mayor Tommy Muska told the Waco Tribune-Herald that as of late evening April 17 six or seven volunteer firefighters from the city were unaccounted for West EMS Director Dr George Smith himself injured stated that he believed at least two emergency responders were killed
We do have confirmed fatalities Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman D.L Wilson said at a midnight news conference on April 17 We have a tremendous amount of injuries? over 100 injuries at this time Wilson did not confirm or deny an earlier report that the number of deaths could be in the range of 60 to 70 He said the blast zone was just like the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City comparing its effects to the Oklahoma City bombing and that there were 50 to 75 homes and businesses damaged Sergeant William Patrick Swanton of the Waco Police Department said the operation has gone into a search-and-rescue mode aiming to find survivors and recover those who might be trapped in buildings He said at least 160 people had been injured and the firefighters who were combating the initial fire were yet to be accounted for Swanton quoted local environmental officials and emergency personnel in saying there was no risk to the community from the smoke fumes rising from the facility
Over 100 people were reported to be injured in the blast and were originally transported to a makeshift triage set up at West High School's football field It was later moved to a community center due to its proximity to the still-burning facility Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center in Waco received over 40 injured for treatment Patients were also admitted to Waco's Providence Healthcare Network Fort Worth's John Peter Smith Health Network Dallas's Parkland Memorial Hospital and Temple's Scott and White Memorial Hospital
It was announced on April 19 that twelve bodies had been recovered sixty people were missing and there had been at least 200 injured The twelve dead included ten first responders as well as two civilians who had volunteered to fight the fire
The final confirmed death toll was fifteen fatalities while approximately 160 people sustained non-fatal injuries
Reaction
Those living in and around West report that the blast felt like an earthquake The United States Geological Survey recorded the explosion as a 2.1-magnitude tremor The blast was heard in nearby Hillsboro Waxahachie DeSoto and as far north as Arlington Windows were blown out in Abbott NNE of West
Texas Governor Rick Perry issued a statement on the evening of April 17
President Barack Obama issued his own statement on April 18
Due to toxic fumes and a large number of displaced families West Independent School District announced on its Twitter feed that all five of the district's schools would stay closed until further notice they reopened on April 22 Nearby school districts Abbott Independent School District ISD and Penelope ISD also closed their schools for a day
Waco Police indicated that the explosion site would be treated as a crime scene out of caution The U.S Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives announced on the morning of April 18 that it would be sending a national response team including fire investigators explosive experts chemists and canine units to investigate the site The U.S Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board an independent federal agency that investigates accidents involving industrial chemicals also dispatched a major investigation team to West to begin searching for the cause of the disaster
Urban Search and Rescue Texas Task Force 1 and Texas Task Force 2 Urban Search and Rescue were deployed on the morning of April 18 to assist in search and rescue An incident management team from the Texas A&M Forest Service was also deployed as was the Veterinary Emergency Team from Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences
Governor Perry declared McLennan County a disaster area and on April 22 President Obama issued an Emergency Declaration which afforded the state aid with 75% federal funding On April 18 the Texas National Guard sent members of the 6th Civil Support Team to the area to test the air quality and assess chemical and biological hazards
On June 13 2013 the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA declined additional aid to the town based in large part on the ability of the State of Texas to provide the necessary funds to rebuild
However on August 2 2013 FEMA reversed its original decision and approved a major disaster declaration for West
Investigation
The state fire marshal department said that investigators interviewed almost 300 people and followed 160 leads in their initial investigation
In May 2013 the Texas Department of Public Safety instructed the Texas Rangers and the McLennan Sheriff's Department to join the Texas Fire Marshall's Office and the U.S Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives in the criminal investigation into the explosion
Ultimately investigators blamed stocks of ammonium nitrate fertilizer stored in a bin inside a seed and fertilizer building on the property for the explosion but failed to identify what started the actual fire that led to the explosion
On April 22 2014 the U.S Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board released the preliminary results of its investigation into the explosion It blamed the disaster on company officials failure to take basic steps regarding safe storage of the chemicals in its stockpile as well as inadequate federal state and local regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials


Emilia Casanova de Villaverde

Emilia Casanova de Villaverde 1832?1897 was a Cuban political activist most notable for her involvement in the Cuban independence movement She founded La Liga de las Hijas de Cuba one of the first all-womenÅfs organizations dedicated to the Antillean emancipation struggle
Early life and career
Emilia Casanova de Villaverde was born into an elite Creole slaveholding family in Cuba in 1832 Despite her affluent Creole upbringing de Villaverde did not share her fatherÅfs conservative views At a banquet during her youth with Spanish authorities in attendance she defiantly made a toast to Cuban freedom from Spanish colonial power
By 1825 most of SpainÅfs colonies in the Americas gained independence except for Cuba and Puerto Rico which remained under Spanish rule Cuban elites believed that Spanish colonialism would help maintain CubaÅfs domination of the sugar industry and prevent a slave uprising similar to the Haitian Revolution in 1791 Over the years many inhabitants of Cuba and Puerto Rico grew dissatisfied with Spanish control intensifying with the Ten Years War 1868-1878 the first major rebellion challenging Spanish authority
Emilia Casanova de Villaverde first traveled to the United States in 1852 along with her father and two brothers This trip gave her exposure to the Cuban exile community in New York and further sparked her interest in the Cuban independence movement Although de Villaverde considered remaining in New York City to continue her education she returned to Cuba after only three months to care for her mother back at home On her return journey she agreed to transport revolutionary documents on behalf of the exile community and distributed them in Cuba
At the age of twenty-two the Casanova family moved to Philadelphia where Emilia met and soon after married Cirilo Villaverde Cirilo Villaverde was a Cuban poet and novelist most notable for writing the novel Cecilia Valdes This novel exposed the complex nature of race and class relations embedded in Cuban society Cirilo had been a politically active member of the Cuban exile community since his arrival in the United States in the 1840s Like many separatists during the 1840s and 1850s he initially believed that annexation to the United States was the only way Cuba could eventually abolish slavery As his viewpoints evolved over time however Cirilo eventually favored true Cuban liberation After marrying the couple moved to New York City where they became actively involved in the Cuban exile communityÅfs independence movement
Early political activity
As Emilia Casanova de Villaverde built up a social network within the Cuban exile community in New York she started organizing public meetings writing articles dedicated to the independence cause and hosting gatherings at her home for supporters of the Cuban revolution However women were generally denied membership into political clubs during this time In response to this barrier Emilia created all-womenÅfs clubs to increase her prominence and decision-making power among exile nationalists Prior to founding the influential revolutionary womenÅfs club Las Hijas de Cuba she formed another womenÅfs organization known as Las Patriotas de Cuba
Las Hijas de Cuba
Founded on February 6 1869 at the St Julien Hotel near Washington Square in New York City Las Hijas de Cuba was created by de Villaverde as a political organization for women fighting for Cuban independence During this time membership in revolutionary and cultural clubs was restricted to males only forcing women to form their own organizations Fourteen Cuban and Puerto Rican women gathered at this initial meeting to discuss helping Cuban soldiers and to criticize the all-male independence organization Junta Revolucionaria de Cuba y Puerto Rico As president of Las Hijas de Cuba Emilia Casanova de Villaverde condemned this all-male club for their Ågannexationist maneuvers and betrayal of the independence movement.Åh The members of Las Hijas de Cuba aware of the United StatesÅf growing interest in controlling Caribbean nations disapproved of the fact that the Junta considered the United States an ally They feared that this would move Cuba closer to annexation by the United States rather than emancipation The collective power of these womenÅfs efforts gained attention and garnered further support for Villaverde The leaders of Junta Revolucionaria de Cuba y Puerto Rico formed a new club called La Liga shortly after which came to be dominated by annexationists
Villaverde used her platform as president of Las Hijas de Cuba to become a more recognizable force within the independence movement The organization played an important role in raising funds for Cuban soldiers during the Ten Years War Additionally as a representative of Las Hijas de Cuba Emilia Casanova de Villaverde presented the merits of Cuban liberation before the U.S Congress on numerous occasions She was the first Cuban woman granted the right to address the United States Congress on this issue When her father was imprisoned in Havana during the Ten Years War Villaverde spoke with U.S government officials including President Ulysses S Grant asking for protection Spain accused many members of the property-owning Creole class of ÅginfidelityÅh during this contentious time loosely defined as any actions disrupting the political order and confiscated their property as punishment President Grant agreed to protect her father from the Spanish government and soon after VillaverdeÅfs father was released In 1871 and 1872 she again petitioned the United States Congress to support Cuban independence rather than Spanish colonial power In 1871 Emilia Casanova de Villaverde pleaded the U.S government for assistance after learning that eight medical school students at the University of Havana were being held hostage by Spanish authorities In 1872 she informed Washington officials of SpainÅfs hostile behavior on the island of Cuba and presented an extensive argument detailing the economic advantages of aiding Cuba over Spain Despite de VillaverdeÅfs efforts the U.S government decided it would be most strategic to side with a weak colonial power rather than a sovereign Cuba
In order to increase the international visibility of the Cuban emancipation struggle she wrote to prominent European figures such as Giuseppe Garibaldi and Victor Hugo In an 1869 letter to Giuseppe Garibaldi Villaverde stated her abolitionist views Ågthe beginning of our revolution means the freedom of our slaves giving them arms and incorporating them in our patriotic ranks.Åh Garibaldi responded to her appeal by stating that he supported CubaÅfs quest for freedom from colonial oppression but he did not make any specific commitments to aid the movement
Later Years
Emilia Casanova de Villaverde remained staunchly involved in the fight for Cuban liberation until her death on March 4 1897 When her husband Cirilo Villaverde died in 1894 she briefly traveled to Cuba for his burial but decided to return to New York City to continue working for Cuban independence for the remainder of her life Her death in 1897 occurred just a year before the Spanish-American War in 1898 which resulted in CubaÅfs independence Just a few years earlier in 1895 the Cubans went to war and essentially won their independence until the explosion of the USS Maine occurred Hence the overthrow of Spanish power did not result in the fulfillment of CubaÅfs revolutionary goals but instead marked the transition to indirect American rule This indirect American intervention in Cuban affairs betrayed the Cuba Libre movementÅfs goals of eradicating colonial oppression and racial inequality


Trent Bridge Inn

The Trent Bridge Inn in Nottingham is an important landmark that is notable as the Trent Bridge Cricket Ground was placed here in a field behind this pub The ground by the pub was also the first home of the Notts County Football Club The pub is now operated by Wetherspoons
History
The Trent Bridge Inn in West Bridgford existed before there was a cricket ground It was located just outside the walls of the city of Nottingham where travellers could stay whilst they waited to enter the city the following morning The inn was owned by the Musters family who owned land in West Bridgford At the time because of a different boundary the inn was in Nottingham there was no licensed property at all in West Bridgford
The inn was instrumental in creating the cricket ground which was set up in competition to the one owned by the town council The first cricket match here was created by William Clarke in 1838 who was the captain of the Nottinghamshire cricket team He had married Mary Chapman the landlady of the Trent Bridge Inn and they had arranged for the land behind the inn to be made available Generally land outside the city could not be built on until the law was changed in 1845 The Clarkes had the land cleared and a fence was erected Matches were held here in preference to the former location within the city which had been used since 1835 The players were able to stay at the inn during the matches
The cricket matches did not attract large crowds and publican William Clarke experimented with other attractions In 1845 Clarke decided to move to London to found the All England Eleven which became a nationally known touring cricket team John Chapman who was Clarke's step son took over the management of the pub and ground for some time but he and his successor enjoyed no great success
1861 saw the launch of the Easter Colts Trials where 22 players were invited to take on the first eleven in competition This match was arranged by a local solicitor John Johnson who since 1859 had reinvigorated the club organising a committee and a first brick pavilion The new match attracted audiences to see who was the best combined batter and bowler and of the first 22 contestants seven went on to play first class cricket for Nottinghamshire
Richard Daft was a well known cricketer at Trent Bridge and he ran the inn at one time as he was a partner in the Radcliffe Brewery He is remembered for captaining the club for ten years but he died a bankrupt in 1900
In 1883 the nearby land was also used by the Notts County Football Club who created a ground on the eastern side However by 1895 they were to move grounds regularly until they found their current home in 1910 At the end of the First World War the Musters family sold the Inn and the ground to the cricket club The club only briefly owned the inn as they resold it to a brewery for a sum in excess of the money they had paid to the Musters However the Inn was give the right to supply food to the ground in perpetuity
The pub was bought by Wetherspoons and a 3 million pounds was spent in a refurbishment It re-opened on 24 May 2011 and features four bars
Notable features
On the outside of the building is a bench mark which records the pub's precise location

Production
A.A.R.M was written by executive producer Brent Forrester marking his eleventh writing credit for the series his first since the earlier season episode Work Bus It was directed by regular Office editor David Rogers marking his ninth directing credit and first since the earlier season episode Junior Salesman The episode was originally supposed to air as a half-hour episode but NBC later announced it would be expanded to fill an hour time slot Unlike the previous episodes that were expanded like Moving On and Livin the Dream A.A.R.M counts as two produced episodes
This episode guest stars Aaron Rodgers Clay Aiken Mark McGrath Santigold and Jessica St Clair In order to get them the show reached out to a small group of celebrities that producers thought would be good Both Aiken and Santigold accepted Baumgartner then asked Rodgers who was a friend and he accepted McGrath later became available and he was chosen as well Angela's son Phillip was played by twins Vince and Evan Edwards The child that filmed the scene in which Phillip picked the beet was only supposed to point to the beet In the end the child said beet which Rogers called amazing The voice of the documentarian that responds to Jim is that of episode director David Rogers Rogers also voiced the same character in the season opener New Guys Originally showrunner and series creator Greg Daniels had re-recorded the line in New Guys but ended up liking Roger's voice better He asked him to reprise the role in A.A.R.M to preserve continuity
Jules Kmetzko designed the portraits of Dwight and Mose as well as Dwight's propaganda picture He had previously created Pam's watercolor of Dunder Mifflin that hung on the walls All of the dances moves were choreographed by Mary Ann Kellogg who had choreographed many of the series dance-heavy episodes The obstacle course in the warehouse was crafted by Rogers and Forrester with input from the show's art department Wilson also helped since he eventually was the one who ran through it it was his idea to have the course terminate on a raised palette of boxes Originally the course was supposed to be in the park lot but Rogers moved it feeling that the warehouse was more organic and that the heat would have been detrimental to the finished product The idea to have Jim finally give Pam his card had been considered in the writers room for some time but only during A.A.R.M did the writers feel it was the right time The card and envelope was the same one used for Christmas Party almost seven years prior In fact the card contained a message that Krasinksi wrote for Fischer which was written prior to the filming of Christmas Party Rogers admitted that the Pam and Jim video was inspired by a number of fan videos that exist on the internet The reason that Open Your Eyes by Snow Patrol plays over the video is that Claire Scanlon the series editor felt that it was similar in style to Sing by Travis which played in the second season episode The Client
The episode contained several scenes that were reminiscent of past episodes of the series The shot in which Jim and Dwight survey the office was filmed to be similar to a scene that featured Dwight and Michael in the third season installment Gay Witch Hunt In addition Dwight pulling Angela over was filmed in a way that recalled the sixth season episode The Delivery Although The scene wherein Jim gives advice to Dwight was shot in a similar manner to Jim's farewell to Michael in the seventh season episode Goodbye Michael it was not intentionally supposed to look like it according to Rogers In addition the obstacle course was not a direct reference to the second season episode Office Olympics although Rogers understood that there were similarities
Cultural references
Jim references both Michael J Fox and the 1985 film Back to the Future during his nonsense conference room meeting Dwight realizes that Phillip is his son after the child looks at a small-scale replica of the Battlestar Galactica fictional ship from the science fiction series of the same name in the same way that Dwight does Dwight's test to see if Phillip is his son has been compared to a similar scene in the 1997 film Kundun in which Tibetan monks practice a similar ritual To win over Kevin Angela and Oscar pretend that baby Phillip presented him with an iTunes gift card Darryl and the rest of the office dance to the song Boogie Wonderland by Earth Wind and Fire The show Andy auditions for The Next Great A Cappella Sensation is a parody of popular singing shows like American Idol The Voice and The X-Factor The fictional show is hosted by Mark McGrath the lead singer from the rock band Sugar Ray The judges for the show include Aaron Rodgers Clay Aiken and Santigold Rodgers is an American football quarterback for the Green Bay Packers Aiken is a singer who gained prominence following the second season of American Idol in 2003 and Santigold is an American singer songwriter and producer Andy sings both the Cornell University fight song as well as You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile from the musical Annie The woman auditioning that he interrupts is Rachel Crow who achieved fame after competing in season one of The X-Factor

Reviews
Alan Sepinwall of HitFix gave the episode a positive review and wrote that as a quasi-finale A.A.R.M was surprisingly Åc terrific in most areas He particularly enjoyed the interaction between Jim and Dwight calling it so much fun he argued that the show would have probably fared better following Steve Carell's departure had the power dynamic and relationship between Jim and Dwight that was explored in A.A.R.M been established earlier in the eighth season He concluded that The best parts of A.A.R.M felt like a fitting close to the non-documentary-viewing portion of the series M Giant of Television Without Pity was pleased with the episode and ultimately awarded the episode an A grade the first for the series since Goodbye Michael almost two seasons ago Jenna Mullins of E Online wrote that the episode was full of emotional moments that seemed like love letters to the fans who have watched the show since the pilot Mullins also praised the scenes between Jim and Pam noting that we collapsed in tears because the couple we've been rooting for Åc can still find ways to make us cry
Nick Campbell of TV.com felt that the episode was a decent if uneven penultimate episode that gave us one last look at this quirky group of people in their office environment He was largely happy with the return of the fun-loving version of Jim noting that Pam mentioned that she loves Goofy Jim and I have to admit I love Goofy Jim myself Campbell felt that the episode dabbled in fan service but that it was expected and needed for the show to have a successful ending Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10 denoting a great episode She wrote that The interplay between Jim Dwight and Pam has been the core of the series since Michael Scott's departure and it was good to see the trio front and center once again as The Office comes to a close Furthermore Cornet was happy with Dwight's proposal and the dance party that signaled Darryl's leaving calling the latter a slice of bliss
Erik Adams of The A.V Club gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it a B+ He noted that what benefits AARM most Åc is a back-to-basics Jim-and-Dwight storyline that illustrated the growth that the characters have experienced in the last nine years Furthermore he wrote that many of scenes were many tender moments in the episode such as Dwight and Jim's confrontation Pam and Jim's reaffirmation of love and Dwight's proposal to Angela He concluded that ItÅfs that blend of new beginnings and closing circles that makes AARM an effective second-to-last chapter of The Office Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote that the episode didn't disappoint He called the scene in which Pam was watching the docu-created montage just as Jim was giving Dwight love advice the most emotionally rewarding moment on The Office since Michael Scott's goodbye
Many critics were extremely pleased with the call back to the teapot and Jim's note from Christmas Party Adams felt that the scene before the reveal of the note was properly executed and that the note made it even better Sepinwall called it a fabulous payoff for longtime fans Cornet called the sequence effective Rick Porter of Zap2it wrote that it was a nice move on the part of the writers for not letting us know what Jim wrote on the card from Christmas Party it has to be pretty epic
Conversely most critics gave Andy's plot a negative review Sepinwall called the entire plot godawfulness Campbell referred to it as a mediocre story that stood in stark contrast to the emotional timbre of the rest of the episode Cornet called the scenes just as disconnected from the core of the show as that character has for some time now Porter wrote that the show never quite got a handle on what to do with the character this season and his subplot in A.A.R.M was the culmination of this issue

Audrey Ushenko

Audrey Ushenko born in 1945 is an American realist figurative painter She was born in Princeton New Jersey and has a daughter named Emily She currently lives in Fort Wayne Indiana where she is a faculty member at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne At this university she teaches figure drawing advanced painting and advanced art history classes Audrey Ushenko received her B.A in English literature 1965 from Indiana University a painting certification from the Art Institute of Chicago 1964 an M.A in painting from Northwestern University 1967 and a doctoral degree in art history from Northwestern University 1978 Her background in English literature has allowed her to explore this particular territory in her art She has had 22 solo shows participates in many group exhibitions including numerous shows at the National Academy of Design and has received numerous distinctions and awards
Motif
She has also painted figural groups often in their authentic surroundings but with a twist In them Ushenko explores the nature of social interaction through her relationship to the natural and constructed worlds but also by questioning their relationships Her oil paintings pay homage to humans as observers and allow viewers to witness the many nuances of everyday sights then UshenkoÅfs work can seem to be unpredictable In particular she is known for Ågjuxtaposing people creatures and objects that you may not expect to be nearby or you would not have noticed otherwise.Åh She routinely paints the same model in related positions although they often contrast for example one model may be portrayed in shade and the other in full sunlight which subtly reveals a sense of duality and dichotomy In many of UshenkoÅfs paintings something appears to have just happened or is just about to occur
While Audrey Ushenko often makes ordinary events appear extraordinary some works are less celebratory This occurs in the process of painting because the meanings of a work develops as she paints rather than being determined from the outset In Vanitas VIII for example there appear to be five images of Ushenko in one room This seems to be a comment on the multiple faces that each person has and displays often in a single day In her painting at the Duchossois Center for Advanced Medicine at the University of Chicago Hospitals she was so inspired by the Ågmagnitude of the ongoing human drama being quietly played out day after dayÅh in the hospital that she wanted to create a work to display it Patients and staff were able to watch Ushenko paint and many were incorporated into the three-story monument
In Perseus and Medusa II she accurately depicts this ancient myth In this myth Perseus was sent by King Polydectes to bring him the head of Medusa in order to remove Perseus from his mother DanaeÅfs side so the king could make her his wife This mission was particularly dangerous because anyone who looked into MedusaÅfs face was said to turn to stone Medusa was one of three sisters but she was the only mortal one The sisters were originally gorgeous maidens but because of PoseidonÅfs profound obsession with her to which she did not return the feelings he turned her and her sisters into monsters with live snakes covering their heads instead of hair Perseus with the help of Athena and Hermes used his mirrored shield to see MedusaÅfs reflection without being turned to stone and therefore successfully cut off her head This oil painting very clearly shows Perseus holding MedusaÅfs newly removed head before returning it to the king Ushenko does an excellent job with giving a very lifelike demonstration of Perseus and Medusa and the face of Medusa can be recognized as UshenkoÅfs very own This work is part of Rowan UniversityÅfs Glassboro New Jersey collection
While Ushenko is known for her figural paintings she is also quite proficient at landscapes In Windy Autumn she allows a little bit of an inside look at her own home This painting was done from the rooftop of her house overlooking her street where the viewer can see her car parked in the driveway She instills beauty into such an ordinary sight by capturing all of the nuances of the color-changing treetops and surrounding homes This neighborhood appears cozy yet very much alive considering the well-kept lawns and helicopters in the sky Ushenko is still able to convey a sense of vivacity in her art even without figures in her paintings

Protestant Coalition

The Protestant Coalition is an Ulster loyalist political party in Northern Ireland It was registered on 23 April 2013 and launched on 24 April at a hotel in Castlereagh outside Belfast
Background
The launch of the Protestant Coalition followed a protracted dispute over the decision by Belfast City Council on 3 December 2012 to cease the practice of flying the Union flag throughout the year over Belfast City Hall opting instead to fly it only on up to 20 designated days per year The council decision by 29 votes Alliance Sinn Fein and Social Democratic and Labour Party to 21 mainly Ulster Unionist Party and Democratic Unionist Party had been followed by protests throughout Northern Ireland some of which became violent Protesters claimed that the flag decision was symptomatic of an erosion of respect for the identity of what they refer to as the PUL Protestant unionist loyalist community
Leadership
The party's founders included prominent anti-republican campaigner Willie Frazer Davy Nicholl a former member of the paramilitary-linked Ulster Democratic Party and Ulster Political Research Group and Jim Dowson a former fundraiser for the British National Party BNP Others involved in the launch were Alice Dowson daughter of Jim Robert Magee from the Woodvale area of Belfast and Bill Hill from Tiger's Bay
At the time of the launch both Frazer and Jim Dowson were awaiting trial on charges related to the flag protests Although Dowson was registered with the Electoral Commission as the Protestant Coalition's leader he stated at the launch that the Coalition had no one leader Paul Golding a former BNP councillor in Sevenoaks and until 2011 the BNP's Communications Officer was registered as the Coalition's treasurer
Dowson a Christian fundamentalist also led an anti-abortion campaign the UK Life League In May 2011 he and Golding had launched a new far-right nationalist movement in Britain Britain First to protect British and Christian morality and campaign against Islam immigration and abortion Britain First registered as a political party in November 2011 Golding had flown into Belfast in December 2012 to help co-ordinate the protests over the flags issue
The website and logo of the Protestant Coalition closely resembled those of Britain First although neither site explicitly mentioned an organisational link
Policies
The policies of the Coalition which described itself as an anti politics political party included opposition to the whole old rotten farce of the DUP/UUP while it was happy to cooperate with the likes of the TUV UKIP and PUP for the greater good of the overall situation It appealed for those elected for other unionist parties to defect to the Coalition The party stated that it exists to protect and secure Ulster's British heritage and identity and to represent the Protestant Unionist and Loyalist people and to oppose the Sinn Fein/IRA cultural and political war against the British majority in Northern Ireland
History
The party claimed at its launch to have over 500 members and that it would remain in existence for three years during which time it would contest elections to new local government councils in May 2014 It also said that it would operate a call centre and use other techniques deployed in American political campaigning The Coalition aimed to cascade down to other Loyal parties groups and organisations the skill-sets and technology to allow the PUL community to professionalise and expand our message Dowson said that if anyone thinks this is a Mickey Mouse thing they are going to be in for a very rude awakening
Within weeks of its launch the Coalition was reported to be in disarray having suffered the loss of several leading supporters Jim Dowson had left by the end of May 2013 for unknown reasons Davy Nicholl had left citing health reasons and Bill Hill was said to be keeping a low profile Both Frazer and Jim Dowson were still awaiting trial on flag protest charges and Frazer - who suggested that the party might reorganise with a different line-up - also faced a court appearance in relation to an alleged breach of his bail conditions
In 2014 it was reported that local unionists in Magherafelt had set up a branch of the party in response to claims of DUP lies and deceit in the town Frazer had been locked out of a council meeting in the town a few weeks previously
Local government elections were held in Northern Ireland in May 2014 but the Protestant Coalition did not present any candidates


Randall Culver

Randall Culver is a fictional character from the American television series The Walking Dead portrayed by Michael Zegen He is an original character and has no comic counterpart Randall appears in Season 2
Television series
Fictional character biography
Randall Culver is a young member of Dave and Tony's group In the episode Triggerfinger Randall's group gets into a shootout with Rick Glenn and Hershel When the gunfire attracts a horde of walkers his group flees but Randall falls and impales his leg on a fence Rick Glenn and Hershel rescue him despite his having shot at them They take him back to Hershel's farm blindfolded and operate to save his leg In the episode 18 Miles Out Rick and Shane take Randall to a secure building to leave him there armed with a knife Randall pleads for his life revealing that he attended the same high school as Maggie and recently lost his mother This leads Rick and Shane to suspect that he knows the location of the farm so Shane attempts to kill Randall but Rick stops him As the two fight Shane accidentally releases a large group of walkers trapped in a building and the three of them flee back to the farm In the episode Judge Jury Executioner Daryl beats and interrogates Randall who reveals that his group has attacked innocent people before Rick decides that Randall should be executed to protect the survivors at the farm Dale argues passionately to spare Randall's life but the rest of the group either supports Rick's decision or is indifferent As Rick prepares to shoot Randall Carl urges his father to do it which horrifies Rick and causes him to stop In the episode Better Angels Rick plans to release Randall but Shane sneaks into the barn Shane brings Randall out into the woods and snaps his neck but tells the rest of the group that Randall attacked him and escaped Glenn and Daryl later discover Randall as a walker and Glenn impales him through the head with a machete They examine the body and find no visible bite marks causing them to become confused as to how Randall became a walker
Development and reception
Zack Handlen writing for The A.V Club in his review of Triggerfinger felt that the dilemma of needing to free Randall when his leg was stuck on the fence was well-handled as once again Rick was willing to do what nobody else was and that Randall's presence on the farm would help keep things interesting on the show Robert Kirkman commented on how Rick and Shane would move forward when considering Randall's fate after 18 Miles Out That's something we're going to be dealing with in our very next episode back just how much of a threat this guy is and what they're going to do with him While he did drive the car they saved him as much as he saved them if not more so I don't think he would have been able to make it out of there alive Them putting him back in the trunk they clearly don't trust the guy to drive back all the way with him The guy's a prisoner now and they have to figure out what they're going to do with him SFX journalist Ian Berriman wondered Once Randall has cut himself free he stabs a female zombie in the head repeatedly with a great deal of enthusiasmÅc is he really the harmless ordinary Joe he claims to be Nate Rawlings of Time declared that his top zombie kill of the week was tied between Randall repeatedly stabbing a female walker in the head with the remarkably disgusting squishy sound over and over and Rick shooting one zombie through the mouth to kill one behind it Andrew Conrad of The Baltimore Sun called Randall's zombie arm-break stomp the second best special move after Shane's motorcycle slam against Rick Cyriaque Lamar of io9 professed that in Judge Jury Executioner the writers should have written off Dale in a more respectable way That wasn't the way to off the show's most annoyingly sane character Dale's redeeming quality was his ability to guilt everybody into paying lip service to rule of law his weakness was his naivete Having an escaping Randall kill him would've offered some poetic symmetry


Temperance Hall Tennessee

Temperance Hall is an unincorporated community in northern DeKalb County Tennessee United States It is located approximately west-southwest of Center Hill Dam It was established in 1798 by Stephen Robinson Sr one of the first four settlers of DeKalb County
Geography
Temperance Hall is located at 36.084 -85.901
History
The area was first visited by a hunting party of an unknown number in 1780 The group killed 105 bears 74 buffalo and more than 80 deer enough to feed all of Fort Nashborough for the winter
Stephen Robinson Sr who originated in Cumberland County Virginia came to the area now known as DeKalb County in 1798 along with Adam Dale and the Fite brothers Leonard and John Although the land was populated by hostile Native Americans each of the four settlers successfully established communities in the area Temperance Hall was originally part of Smith County until a border realignment on February 1 1850 reclassified the town as a DeKalb County community In Temperance Hall several mills were established along the Smith Fork of the Caney Fork River commonly known as Smith Fork Creek The largest mill built by settler Samuel Caplinger was located about half a mile northwest of town at the confluence of the Smith Fork and a smaller branch It remained in operation until being mostly destroyed by a flood in 1946 Some of the mill's remains are still intact located approximately to the southwest of the Highway 264 bridge across the Smith Fork Caplinger built a house on a nearby hill overlooking the town in 1821 The house was notable for being unlike any other known house in Tennessee and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 12 1980 but was removed on April 20 1989 and torn down shortly afterward
Many homes were built in the area around the mill as settlers were attracted to the fertile farm land along the Smith Fork Numerous stores a hotel a bank an undertaking business and several churches soon followed the first of the churches?Mt Zion
Baptist Church?opened in 1850 a couple miles south of town and was then followed by churches of other denominations which were located directly in town Many physicians started practices in the area as well A post office was established in 1850 but was closed in 1904 The bank which was known as The Temperance Hall Bank & Trust Company operated for many years before closing during the Great Depression Perhaps the most notable citizen of Temperance Hall during the 1800s was Colonel William Brickly Stokes a politician and Union general during the American Civil War Although he grew up in Temperance Hall Stokes would retire to nearby Alexandria
By the 1890s Temperance Hall was a thriving community of about 150 citizens There were three dry good stores one drug store two blacksmith shops and two mills They had three doctors many carpenters and men of many other professions However most of the residents were farmers by profession and produced much corn wheat sorghum and livestock which was transported to the larger cities for sale The town had one of the first telephone offices in DeKalb County and it operated for many years until closing in the early 1950s A stockyard was also operated in the town and when purchased livestock would be taken to nearby Hickman to be transported by train On February 15 1895 one of the mills burned to the ground If it had not been for a large snow that lay on the ground many of the townÅfs houses would have burned The mill contained 300 bushels of corn 400 bushels of wheat 2-1/2 barrels of sorghum and lots of meal flour and lumber all of which was lost
Temperance Hall was also known for being home to many race horses some of which were nationally known One quarter horse named Ariel owned by Colonel Stokes won so many races that he was banned from most tracks however Stokes painted Ariel a different color and won more races until the paint began to remove the horse's hair
The first school in the area was a one-room log house that was located near the Methodist Church Later a two-story frame building with large columns and covered entrances was built and named Earl Academy in honor of the school's first teacher School began at Earl Academy on January 23 1895 and by early February over 100 students were enrolled The school was considered the best in the county by many people In 1920 a new two-story building was constructed just outside of the main part of town The building served as the new school until it burned down in June 1949 A new one-story building was built in its place during the early 1950s and served as the school until Temperance Hall's school was closed in the 1960s for lack of students The building was renovated and reopened on October 31 1971 as a community center The building still serves as a community center in the present day
Many people in the Temperance Hall area would go pearl hunting in the Caney Fork River Many pearls found in mussels in the river were sold for hundreds and sometimes even thousands of dollars
Although never being officially incorporated into a town Temperance Hall was one of the most prosperous areas in DeKalb County for many decades However during the Great Depression many residents began to move north to look for work As a result many of the industries in Temperance Hall and nearby Alexandria began to decline Almost all of the businesses schools banks churches and the Temperance Hall Hotel closed as well the hotel was later turned into a house and still stands By the 1990s the last store in Temperance Hall had closed leaving only three small churches and the community center remained Since the 1980s the community center has hosted a weekly country music dance and has had several local bands perform there The center also serves as the polling place for Temperance Hall and the nearby Long Branch and Cove Hollow communities and can be rented privately for special events
Name
Temperance Hall received its name from a local branch of the Sons of Temperance in the 1800s The group would meet on the top floor second floor of the town's hotel which still stands today The second floor of the hotel had a long hallway in which townspeople would gather to hear lectures and speeches on the issue of temperance The hallway became known as Temperance Hall and thus the town was named such

Chitinase domain-containing protein 1

Chitinase domain-containing protein 1 CHID1 is a highly conserved protein of unknown function located on the short p arm of chromosome 11 near the telomere The protein has 27 introns which allows for many isoforms of this gene It has several aliases the most common of which is Stabilin-1 interacting chitinase-like protein SI-CLP As indicated by the alias CHID1 is known to interact with the protein STAB1 CHID1 is expressed ubiquitously at levels nearly 6 times the average gene and is conserved very far back to organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans and possibly some prokaryotes This protein is known to have carbohydrate binding sites which could be involved in carbohydrate catabolysis
Gene
CHID1 is located on chromosome 11 at the location p15.5 It is just downstream of TSPAN4 and upstream of AP2A2 CHID1 is ubiquitously expressed at a high levels Through microarray analysis it has been shown that CHID1 is generally expressed at 5.7 times the average gene CHID1 has many known variants which is attributed to its 37 exons There are no inherent repeats or hairpin structures to be found within the coding region of CHID1 This gene is a member of the GH18 superfamily which dictates some of its protein structure This gene also has several aliases the most common of which is Stabilin-1 interacting chitinase-like protein or SI-CLP which indicates its known interaction with STAB1
Variations
Due to its large size and many exons CHID1 has many transcript variants that have been identified through mRNA sequencing CHID1 has 27 exons and 22 known splice forms These forms indicate that there may be multiple promotor regions and transcription start sites used within the genome The most commonly found transcripts translate to about 400 amino acids each
Homology
CHID1 shows a very high level of conservation It has been identified in many model systems including Drosophila melanogaster Caenorhabditis elegans and Oryza sativa When conservation is observed over a large region it becomes clear which protein domains are most important to CHID1 By far the two best conserved factors are exon junctions you can add a link to exon junction as well as several known carbohydrate binding sites Another important region appears to be the last 15 amino acids which retain a high level of conservation even through insect sequences
Paralogs
There are also several proposed paralogs to CHID1 These genes are di-N-acetylchitobiase Chitinase-3-like protein 2 and chitotriosidase 1 All of these genes have roughly 40% similarity and match human transcripts of CHID1 over 40-50% of the gene Based on the level of conservation these paralogs all likely split at a time near to the split from bacteria
Protein
The protein translation of CHID1 is typically about 400 amino acids long though this varies within the many known forms and has few post-translational modifications In most forms and orthologs it is predicted that CHID1 has a signal peptide that varies in length by sequence Structure predictions and x-ray crystallography structures of CHID1 indicate that its secondary structure is heavy in alpha helices though it definitely has some beta strands present as indicated by the SI-CLP x-ray crystallography structure CHID1 is also a member of the GH18 superfamily of proteins which has a unique conserved structure Members of this family contain an 8 stranded beta/alpha barrel This protein is also shown to interact with other copies of itself in a homodimer which also uses sulfate ion interacting molecules for an unknown purpose
Expression
The expression of CHID1 is consistently shown to be ubiquitous and higher than average in all human tissues When analyzing the promoter region of CHID1 in humans this expression is explained by the large number of transcription factor binding sites which are active in a wide range of tissues or are even ubiquitous In Drosophila melanogaster tissue expression varies wildly between larval and adult tissue While expression is extremely widespread in adults it is not at such a high level as in humans In larvae CHID1 is only shown to be expressed in specific tissues and is up-regulated in very different tissues than in adults In larval tissues expression is highest in the salivary gland but in adults the highest expression by far is in the male accessory gland Though expression is generally high in some species it is not necessarily abnormal In situ hybridization of gene transcripts in mouse brains shows that CHID1 is expressed relatively normally The pattern of high and low expression with the brain is very similar to another widespread gene beta actin This is one indication that CHID1 may show normal expression patterning in mammals despite its general upregulation
Function
Although CHID1 has no known function for certain there are several proposed activities of the protein based on current knowledge This protein may participate in metabolic processes such as chitin catabolism or carbohydrate metabolism It may locate in various cellular compartments such as the cytoplasm or in lysosomes all depending on certain post-translational modifications Another study proposed that CHID1 may have roles in pathogen sensing The function of CHID1 may also depend on its putative binding partner STAB1 which is proposed to participate in cell signaling and defense against bacterium
Interactions
CHID1 is only strongly suggested to interact with one other protein The transmembrane protein stabilin-1 has been detected as an interactant by in vitro in vivo and yeast two-hybrid assays STAB1 is a large transmembrane receptor protein which may function in many aspects such as lymphocyte homing or angiogenesis It is expressed at over twice the average gene level and is expected to play a role in cell defense against bacterium This interaction may give insight towards the function of both proteins as a whole
Clinical Significance
Overall the significance of CHID1 is unknown Many expression profiles of CHID1 show that its expression does not change in any common diseases or conditions as currently studied Given the lack of knowledge about the function of CHID1 it is difficult to further study its role within the human condition

Janet Taylor Spence

Janet Taylor Spence born August 29 1923 is an American psychologist who has worked in the field of the psychology of anxiety and in gender studies
Early life
Janet Taylor Spence was born on August 29 1923 in Toledo Ohio She was the older of two daughters Her sister was born in 1927 Her father John Chrichton and her mother Helen Taylor were both active members of their community John joined the school board after running for governor and Helen worked with the League of Women Voters
Education
Spence received her undergraduate degree in Psychology at Oberlin College in 1945 The fall after finishing her bachelor's degree she began a graduate program at Yale University which she left for the New York Rotating Internship Program It is here that she changed and better developed her interests from clinical practice to human behavior She later transferred to the University of Iowa Yale proved to be an important part of her life as this where she met her future husband and co-creator of the Hull-Spence Hypothesis of discrimination learning Kenneth Spence While at the University of Iowa she worked as his graduate student doing anxiety research
An extension of the Hull-Spence Hypothesis her dissertation studied the possibility of anxiety being a dispositional trait Quite simply I investigated whether chronically anxious individuals would classically condition more rapidly that less anxious individuals,Åh she explained One of her accomplishments was creating an instrument to measure her hypothesis This instrument called the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale Ågconsisted of 50 statements that were indicative of manifest anxiety when answered a certain way,Åh and is one of her most acknowledged pieces especially because it was the first of its kind She graduated in 1949 with a Ph.D in Psychology
Post-education work and life
After graduation Spence accepted a position as a psychology instructor at Northwestern University In 1951 her first article Anxiety and strength of UCS as determiners of the amount of eyelid conditioning,Åh was published with Kenneth Spence as the co-author In the same year her first independently authored article The relationship of anxiety to the conditioned eyelid response was published She later received associate professor standing and stayed at this job until 1960 She first experienced gender discrimination in the work force when she began teaching at Northwestern University She was given the opportunity to be the first female faculty member because as Janet Taylor Spence said Ågthe chair of the university thought Åehaving a woman on the faculty was a novel and interesting idea,ÅfÅh against the belief of some of the other faculty members She also worked as a statistics professor and wrote a statistics textbook
Janet Taylor Spence and Kenneth Spence were married on December 27 1959 and moved to Iowa shortly after As she was female and unable to get a job at the Department of Psychology of the University of Iowa she was hired by the Veterans Hospital in Iowa City as a research psychologist While working at the VA Hospital she was able to expand her interests to the study of schizophrenia In 1964 she and her husband moved to Austin Texas for his job at the University of Texas Just like in Iowa because she was female she was unable to get a job at the university She accepted a job at an institution for the mentally handicapped called the Austin State School While there she began a number of studies with normal and mentally handicapped children She was later offered a position at the University of Texas by the Department of Educational Psychology She went on to replace the chair of the Department of Psychology
Her husband died on January 12 1967 but that did not slow down her progress In 1970 Spence was elected to the Board of Scientific Affairs of the American Psychological Association APA Two years later she became the president of the Southwestern Psychological Association In 1974 she began editing Contemporary Psychology where she had started as an associate editor to Gardner Lindzey five years prior During the mid to late 1970s she was on the Board of Directors for the APA She also became the sixth female president of the APA in 1985
In 1989 she founded and became president of the American Psychological Society She was awarded the 1993 National Association of Scholars Award for Excellence in Scientific Reviewing She has been awarded three honorary doctorates from Oberlin College Ohio State University and the University of Toledo She also received the American Psychological FoundationÅfs 2004 Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Science of Psychology American Psychologist 2004 She has been a visiting research professor at Harvard twice She has claimed that as children and teenagers my sister and I were fully exposed to all these activities...perhaps it was due to the exposure to the human suffering so common during the Depression and my parents concern with it that as a young adolescent I decided I wanted to become a psychologist

Finnish?Swedish border

The Finnish-Swedish border is the border between the countries of Finland and Sweden Almost the entire border runs through water on land mostly along the Tornio River and through the Baltic Sea Only a few kilometres of the border are on dry land Because of the Schengen treaty and the Nordic Passport Union the border can be crossed mostly freely
Course of the border
In the north the Finnish?Swedish border begins from the Treriksroset tripoint at the border of Norway located in the Koltajarvi lake near Kilpisjarvi The first 230 metres of the border are in straight lines and marked with border signs The border continues as a river border first along a small river to Kuohkimajarvi then along Kuohkimajoki to Kilpisjarvi then along the rivers Konkamaeno Muonionjoki and Tornionjoki a total of 555.5 kilometres down to Tornio The river border runs along the deepest parts of the rivers the thalweg and is not marked with border signs instead the border location is defined by the official maps of the border protocol
The moving of the border has caused sovereignty islands where a part of the island's owners live in different countries than the island itself
In Tornio the border departs from the river the centre of Tornio is located west of the river but belongs to Finland The border runs in straight lines for 4.03 kilometres between the cities of Tornio and Haparanda and from there in straight lines 25.31?km as a maritime border mostly through sea but also through islands including one called Kataja In 1809 the border went between the islands Kataja and Inakari but the post-glacial rebound has caused them to join into a single island The border continues as a maritime border to a point in the Bothnian Bay where the Finnish and Swedish territorial waters depart from each other
In the Bothnian Bay and the Bothnian Sea the Finnish and Swedish territorial waters are separated by international waters The territorial waters meet again in the Sea of Aland where the countries have a maritime border of 15 kilometres The border crosses the island of Market which has a 470-metre long complexly shaped border marked with border signs
The international waters between the countries are divided into economic zones The border between the economic zones mainly runs in straight lines through defined coordinate points There have been agreements about the borders in 1972 and in 1994 The zone border continues south into the northern Baltic Sea to a point where it meets the zone border of Estonia The tripoint between the economic zones is defined by a treaty signed in 2001
History
The Finnish?Swedish border was created in 1809 at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn when Sweden ceded Finland over to Russia The course of the border was described in the fifth article of the treaty without great detail The borders were agreed to be the Sea of Aland the Bothnian Bay and the rivers of Tornionjoki and Muonionjoki Islands in the sea belonged to whichever country was the nearest to them At the mouth of the Torniojoki river the Pirkkio island the harbour of Roytta and the city of Tornio were agreed to belong to Russia Along the rivers the border was agreed to run along the deepest part of the river Thalweg The border ran up the Muonionjoki river and past Kilpisjarvi to Norway
The course of the border was amended in 1810 and small changes were later made
The island of Market was decided to be split in two parts in a topographical description made in 1811 The border was decided to run through the geographical centre of the island defined by coordinates in the treaty of Aland in 1921 and in the treaty of continental plates in 1972 The Market lighthouse built in 1885 by Finland and operated by them was left on the Swedish side In 1981 a curve was made into the border to get the lighthouse to the Finnish side
The border is agreed to be regularly inspected every 25 years During the independence of Finland inspections have been made in 1926?1927 1956?1957 1981 and 2006 These inspections include inspecting the course of the border updating the border signs and defining the location of the deepest parts of the river through aerial and terrestrial photography Especially in the wide sandbanked areas of the rivers the deepest parts shift in location If the deepest part has shifted the border may be shifted accordingly For example in the 2006 inspection the border was shifted in many places usually 10 to 20 metres in some places up to 100 metres A similar total area was moved from one country to another in both directions
Traffic
Because both Finland and Sweden are part of the Schengen area the border may be crossed anywhere If the traveller is carrying goods to be declared through customs the border may still be crossed anywhere but the traveller must contact customs to declare his/her goods
Through the entire river border near the eastern shore the Finnish National Road 21 runs between Tornio and Kilpisjarvi Bridges across the river border can be found in Karesuvanto regional road 959 Muonio regional road 954 Kolari regional road 943 Pello regional road 937 and in Aavasaksa in Ylitornio trunk road 98
Across the border from Tornio to Haparanda runs the European route E4 Finnish National Road 29 on the Finnish side South of the centre the Tornionjoki railway bridge crosses the river and the border
In Haparanda there are plans for a bus station common to both cities which would be located on the Swedish side near the border


Personal Responsibility in a Desirable Environment

Personal Responsibility in a Desirable Environment PRIDE is a non-profit organization that links citizens with the resources of local state and federal agencies to improve the region's water quality clean up solid waste problems and advance environmental education It was originally launched by Congressman Hal Rogers and General James Bickford in 1997 and is a state wide non-profit organization in Kentucky
Mission
The PRIDE mission is to improve the native region by encouraging citizens to contribute and take responsibility for protecting the environment and to help provide the education and resources needed to do so
Outings
The annual P.R.I.D.E Spring Cleanup is held the entire month of April and PRIDE works with communities during the month of April to create a clean and healthy environment in time for the upcoming recreation and tourism season and local P.R.I.D.E Personal Responsibility in a Desirable Environment committees meet monthly to plan events every year Officials say it is a chance for folks to get out and improve their communities
The Kentucky P.R.I.D.E reported online that nearly 10,600 volunteers have picked up nearly 62,000 bags of trash and eliminated 416 illegal dumps in Pike County more than 4,000 volunteers have picked up 5,318 bags of trash and eliminated 11 illegal dumps in Letcher County and nearly 8,700 volunteers have picked up nearly 24,000 bags of trash and eliminated 29 dumps in Floyd County and fourteen volunteers cleaned along Rts 2566 2565 and 3 in Lawrence County collecting 44 bags of trash and two tires along 5.4 miles of roadway Also more than 150 people gathered recently in Corbin to discuss expanding recycling in southern and Eastern Kentucky Not only volunteers contribute to this cleanup families from communities contribute without even realizing it because of their own spring cleanup habits
The Pike County Clean Community Board who cooperate with the PRIDE organization helps in educational outreach program The program also sponsored by the Pike County Board of Education and funded through Litter Abatement funds sends a representative to local schools to educate children about becoming litter free.The board will also emphasize recycling efforts in the county
Pike County Solid Waste officials reported that the countyÅfs recycling program diverted more than 450 tons of garbage from the landfill last year More than half of the diverted material ? 254 tons ? was cardboard Approximately 158 tons of newspaper 23 tons of mixed paper 14 tons of plastic three tons of phone books and one ton of white paper were also recycled instead of filling up the landfill

During Cinzano's ownership Tenuta di Argiano was one of the Brunello di Montalcino estates that was investigated during the Brunellopoli scandal for suspicion of adulterating the wines with other grape varieties which under Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita DOCG regulations are supposed to be made from 100% Sangiovese In 2008 the suspected vintages were impounded by government officials and eventually Tenuta di Argiano declassified the wines selling them as Super Tuscans under the Indicazione Geografica Tipica IGT designation instead of as Brunello di Montalcinos In February 2013 Cinzano sold the Tenuta di Argiano estate to an undisclosed group of international investors for reportedly near 50 million euros

Uruguay?Argentina 2030 FIFA World Cup bid

The Uruguay?Argentina 2030 FIFA World Cup bid is a joint bid by Uruguay and Argentina to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup The bid followed an earlier web movement claiming that FIFA should give Uruguay hosting rights for the 100th anniversary of the first 1930 FIFA World Cup which was also held in Uruguay
Background
The project was originally the idea of Abel Fialko a Uruguayan resident in Israel
Athens the capital of Greece the home of the ancient and first modern 1896 Summer Olympics was considered by many observers during the 1996 bidding period as the natural choice for the Centennial Olympic Games of 1996 However in the end the U.S city of Atlanta was selected to host the Centennial Olympics
Because of that incident Fialko had a real concern that Uruguay's historical rights to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup because Uruguay hosted the first edition of that tournament would not be enough and that Uruguay would end up having the same fate as Athens
Abel Fialko then launched a website in 1997 and began gathering more and more people using the internet to his cause
Using the benefits of the Internet to his advantage and realizing that through it the World was literally a global village Fialko managed to bring upon himself the attention of many of his countrymen
Soon the world media learned of the initiative and Fialko was interviewed several times
On Tuesday 4 October 2005 during his visit to Uruguay to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the inaugural FIFA World Cup FIFA President Sepp Blatter had a meeting with the Uruguayan President Tabare Vazquez In that meeting Vazquez formally suggested that Uruguay could co-host the 2030 FIFA World Cup with another MERCOSUR nation to commemorate the centenary of Uruguay 1930
After the meeting Sepp Blatter stated During our meeting the President told me of his dream of seeing this tournament hosted in the region I told him that today's dream could be tomorrow's vision which in turn could become a proper initiative and finally a project At present the South American Football Confederation is scheduled to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup and all national associations will be able to present their candidature when we begin the selection process at the end of 2006 Dr Nicholas Leoz tells me that with the system of rotation it will be the turn of South America in 2030 That is the situation as it currently stands
Uruguay-Argentina joint bid
In October 2007 Julio Grondona President of the Argentine Football Association accepted a proposal from neighboring Uruguay to bid to co-host the 2030 World Cup Grondona said in the formal response letter to the Uruguayan football authorities:"the Argentine Football Association Executive Committee at its meeting yesterday unanimously approved applying for your initiative to jointly organize the FIFA World Championship 2030 Undoubtedly to crystallize this purpose will lead to further deepen the friendly ties that forever bind the two countries and hence sports and government officials on both sides of the Rio de la Plata will work together in order to meet the final goal of 2030 World Cup
In that same month during a meeting of CONMEBOL South American Football Confederation Uruguay received the support of other South American countries to co-host the 2030 World Cup football finals with Argentina
On November 18 2009 the same day that Uruguay national football team managed to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup FIFA stated that it was pleased with Uruguay and Argentina's initiative to jointly organize the 2030 World Cup
A few days later on November 25 2009 in a meeting of presidents of the national associations and members of the Executive Committee of CONMEBOL the Argentinian and Uruguayan Football Associations received unanimous support for the joint bid to host the World Cup 2030
On June 10 2010 just a day before the opening of the 2010 World Cup a special delegation of the Tourism and Sports Ministry of Uruguay met with Sepp Blatter in Johannesburg formally proposing the bid of Uruguay and Argentina as the hosts of the 2030 World Cup
Argentina fell down
Miguel Angel Silva the Argentine football association vice-president appeared to rule that out
Argentina is not thinking about the 2030 World Cup We haven't even considered it yet If you asked me concretely Argentina will not bid to organise that World Cup Chilean local daily La Tercera quoted him as saying

Battle of Florvag

The Battle of Florvag was a naval battle that was fought on 3 April 1194 between King Sverre Sigurdsson leader of the Birkebeiner party and Sigurd Magnusson the Oyskjegg party pretender Although there had been previous revolts during Sverre's reign following his usurpation of the throne in 1184 the revolt in support of Sigurd Magnusson son of former king Magnus Erlingsson became far more threatening than the attempts of previous pretenders In a larger context the battle was part of the century-long civil war era in Norway
As Sigurd was a minor the actual leaders behind the revolt were Hallkjell Jonsson and Olav Jarlsmag The Oyskjeggs recruited their initial army in Orkney and Shetland hence their name meaning island-men returned to Norway in 1193 and quickly took control over a large part of the country Based in Bergen for the winter the Oyskjegg fleet relocated to the nearby bay of Florvag off Askoy in anticipation of the arrival of Sverre's Birkebeiner fleet from Nidaros The battle began with a surprise attack by the Birkebeiners during night Although the Oyskjeggs gained the upper hand for most of the battle and victory eventually seemed within reach their ships were caught in a current during the final stages of the battle This caused them to become easy prey for the Birkebeiner who in the end won the battle decisively and extinguished the majority of the Oyskjegg army including their leaders
Background
The main source for the battle and the events leading up to it is King Sverre's own Sverris saga Sverre had usurped the throne from the previous king Magnus Erlingsson following the Birkebeiner victory at the Battle of Fimreite in 1184 In the years after this there were a succession of revolts started against Sverre in support of various pretenders Almost ten years after Sverre's usurpation a revolt that would prove far more precarious for Sverre was started based around Sigurd Magnusson the only widely recognised son of Magnus Erlingsson Since Sigurd was a minor the group supporting his claim to the throne was led by Sigurd's guardian lendmann Hallkjell Jonsson along with Olav Jarlsmag and Sigurd Jarlsson The saga also claims that Bishop Nicholas Arnesson was involved with the revolt but this is disputed by modern historians Sigurd Magnusson was sent westwards to Shetland and Orkney in 1192 and gained the military support of Earl Harald Maddadsson who provided the rebels with a longship Sigurd was proclaimed king of Norway in Orkney and was permitted to recruit an army in Harald's realm
The army sailed to Viken the south-eastern part of Norway in 1193 with 23 ships and 2,000 men and had Sigurd proclaimed king at the Haugating This force was commonly called the Oyskjeggs meaning the island-men although they themselves preferred to be called the Gullbeiner gold-legs as opposed to their opponents the Birkebeiner birch-legs The Oyskjeggs sailed for a brief raid for booty in Denmark and after returning to Norway they took control over the entire country south of Stad?thus most of Western Southern and Eastern Norway Sigurd and the Oyskjeggs took up their base in Bergen for the winter although they failed to take the city castle Sverresborg which was defended by 300 loyal Birkebeiners Not expecting a Birkebeiner attack until spring the Oyskjegg army was distributed across the country The fleet was also divided up with six ships stationed under Sigurd Jarlsson's command in Stavanger and three in Sogn
Battle
After hearing news of the Oyskjegg offence Sverre gathered his troops and sailed south from his base in Nidaros Trondheim with 20 ships When Sverre was closing in on Bergen on 2 April the Oyskjeggs went to their ships and sailed across Byfjorden to the bay of Florvag off the southeastern side of the island Askoy Sverre arrived in the evening and left his fleet in Gravdal After gaining intelligence of Oyskjegg plans of a counter-attack Sverre set out to surprise the Oyskjeggs with an attack before dawn
The Birkebeiner fleet approached Florvag in early 3 April Palm Sunday while it was still dark The Oyskjeggs did not know of the attack until they heard the noise from the Birkebeiner ships crushing into their own ships As the Birkebeiner warriors guarded themselves with their shields the Oyskjeggs found no targets to shoot at until the Birkebeiner finally charged at the Oyskjeggs The Oyskjeggs had an advantage since their ships were taller than those of the Birkebeiner and they managed to pull Sverre's own royal ship towards them killing all the archers and capturing the royal banner Sigerflua
After heavy losses on both sides the Birkebeiner managed to shake off the Oyskjegg fleet and started a retreat The Oyskjeggs began chasing the Birkebeiner but since their oars had been broken the Oyskjegg ships were suddenly dragged into a strong current and the Birkebeiner fleet returned to attack the ships of the Oyskjeggs The Birkebeiner also gained reinforcements of a fresh ship with 100 men from Sverresborg and easily defeated the Oyskjeggs one ship at a time Only two Oyskjegg ships managed to get away and except for some men who requested pardoning the majority of the Oyskjegg forces were killed including Sigurd Magnusson Hallkjell Jonsson and Olav Jarlsmag
Numbers
According to the saga the Birkebeiner fleet consisted of 20 ships plus a ship from Sverresborg that joined later on during the final stages of the battle The Oyskjeggs had a numerically smaller fleet of 14 ships available during the battle but compensated this by having ships that were larger in size Historian Halvdan Koht estimated both fleets to carry total forces of approximately 2,000 men this was later supported by historian Anders Bjarne Fossen Koht estimated the Oyskjegg casualties at 1,000 men but Fossen raised that number to 1,500 While harder to pinpoint Fossen estimated the numbers of Birkebeiners killed in the battle at around 900?1,000 men These numbers makes the Battle of Florvag possibly the deadliest naval battle fought in Norwegian history
Aftermath
Sverre became the undisputed ruler of Norway after the victory at Florvag and was at the height of his power during the following years On 29 June Sverre had himself coronated in Bergen by the bishops in Norway all except one installed by Sverre and thus loyal to his rule As the king was an excommunicated priest his coronation was prohibited by the Catholic Church and served as the catalyst to a new struggle of his this time with the Pope The only bishop who opposed the coronation in line with the Church's policy was Nicholas Arnesson whom Sverris saga accuses of being behind the Oyskjegg revolt a claim that is considered unsubstantiated by modern historians
After learning that Sverre planned to subdue Orkney Earl Harald Maddadsson who had supported the Oyskjegg revolt went as quickly as he could to meet Sverre in Bergen He then pleaded his innocence and apologised to Sverre claiming that he had not allowed the Oyskjeggs to raise an army in his realm Sverre settled with Harald by asserting his overlordship and taxation rights over Orkney and Shetland
Vinje runic inscriptions
Most of the Oyskjeggs who managed to escape fled to Denmark Sigurd Jarlsson a surviving Oyskjegg leader was in Bergen during the battle although he did not take part himself and fled to Telemark when he received news of the defeat The detour to Telemark before he later arrived in Denmark is known from two runic inscriptions that were discovered in the Vinje stave church when it was demolished in 1796 one of them having been written by Sigurd himself
Latin transliteration
Old Norse transcription
English translation
The other runic inscription found in the stave church was written by one Halvard Grenske possibly identical with Halvard Bratte who had actually taken part in the Battle of Florvag His inscription is written in verses cursing those who commit betrayal as well as promising the continued struggle of the enemies of Sverre

Critical response
David Hinckley of New York Daily News gave the series 4 out of 5 stars saying Add forbidden love which can never escape the shadow of potential doom and Star-Crossed could become both provocative and entertaining Diana Werts of Newsday gave the series 3 out of 4 stars saying Plenty of potential if Star-Crossed stops talking down to us Carrie Raisler of The A.V Club gave the series a positive review Jeanne Jakle of San Antonio Express-News gave a positive review particularly of Aimee Teegarden's performance saying Just as she was so heartbreakingly natural as young Julie Taylor she also comes across refreshingly unpretentious in Star-Crossed ? which actually may be the best reason of all to watch the CW drama
Gail Pennington of St Louis Post-Dispatch gave the series 2 of 4 stars signaling mixed reviews saying Star-Crossed doesn't aim as high as those Lanter does get a few witty lines ÅgOne of my hearts stopped beating for a few minutes Luckily I had a backup)Åh but the tone is mostly dreary and the plot with few exceptions goes precisely where you expect Only if the romance proves genuinely heart-stopping to young fans maybe the same ones who have embraced Reign will this one be a hit Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times gave the series an mixed review saying It's the usual dance of insiders and outsiders mean kids and weirdos of Sharks and Jets Montagues and Capulets biting their thumbs at one another in the school corridor while one special guy and girl fall in love There are the good ones and the bad ones and the bad good ones and the good bad ones Adults as always in these things are no help at all
David Wiegand of the The San Francisco Chronicle giving it a negative review saying The title is Star-Crossed because it's about an alien boy who falls in love with a human girl a repurposed Romeo and Juliet without the poetry Or drama Or credibility Robert Bianco of USA Today saying As vapid as it is unoriginal Star-Crossed is sadly typical of a network that continually underestimates its audience Teenagers may not be smarter than they were when the WB was at its peak but it's unlikely they're dumber So why does CW treat them as if they are Matt Roush of TV Guide gave an negative review saying Star-Crossed lacks humor suspense or even heat

Teradici

Teradici is a privately held software company founded in 2004 with head offices in Metropolitan Vancouver BC and Santa Clara CA
Teradici initially developed a protocol PCoIP for compressing and decompressing images and sound when remotely accessing blade servers and implemented it in hardware Later this technology was expanded to thin clients/zero clients for general Virtual Desktop Infrastructure Teradici's protocol and/or hardware is used by HP Dell-Wyse Amulet Hotkey Samsung Amazon Web Services Fujitsu and VMware
History
Teradici was founded in 2004 by Dan Cordingley Dave Hobbs Ken Unger and Maher Fahmi It operated in stealth mode until 2007 when they announced their first products a blade server card and a small hockey puck shaped client utilizing a Teradici-designed chip which implemented the PCoIP protocol
In 2008 VMware announced it was licensing Teradici's PCoIP protocol Teradici developed a software implementation of PCoIP which VMware started shipping in VMware View 4
The Teradici name originated from a previous company the founders were incubating That company's product involved a 100-gigabit datacenter networking device One-tenth of a tera is a deci but Teradeci didn't roll off the tongue Teradici was unique sounded better and the domain name was available at the time
PCoIP Protocol
PC-over-IP PCoIP is a proprietary remote display protocol developed by Teradici The protocol is available in hardware silicon and in software
In 2008 VMware licensed Teradici's PCoIP protocol and supports it in VMware Horizon View
PCoIP is a UDP based protocol that is host rendered multi-codec and dynamically adaptive Images rendered on the server are captured as pixels compressed and encoded and then sent to the client for decryption and decompression Depending on the image different codecs are used to encode the pixels sent since techniques to compress video images differ in effectiveness compared to those for text The protocol also dynamically adapts its encoding based on the available bandwidth In low bandwidth environments it utilizes lossy compression where a highly compressed image is quickly delivered followed by additional data to refine that image a process termed build to perceptually lossless The default is to use lossless compression which is used when there is minimal network congestion or when explicitly configured as might be required for scenarios where image fidelity is more important than conserving bandwidth e.g for medical imaging
Relationship with VMware
In 2008 VMware licensed Teradici's PCoIP protocol and supports it in VMware Horizon View
Relationship with Amazon
In 2013 Amazon licensed the PCoIP protocol for use in AWS Amazon Workspaces


I Love You The Neighbourhood album

I Love You stylized I Love You is the debut studio album by American indie rock band The Neighbourhood which was released worldwide on April 22 2013
Background
The tracks on this album expresses a series of angst-ridden themes based on both the vibe and lyrical content of the songs Bryan Sammis explained to Coup De Main magazine I think that at least in terms of the musical aspect of it all of us try and get our own emotions out through our instruments which is not always the easiest thing to do I think for Jesse Rutherford lyrically what I really like about him and about us as a band is that a lot of his lyrics aren't necessarily pre-ordained because he's not trying to force it A lot of his lyrics are off the top of his head when he first hears the song because that makes it more natural it's legitimately what he is thinking about and how he is feeling when he hears that song
Reception
Critical
Critical response to I Love You was mixed aggregating website Metacritic reports a weighted average rating of 48 based on 8 reviews indicating mixed or average reviews This Is Fake DIY reviewer Jamie Milton gave the album its best noted rating 7/10 commenting Neighbourhood stick to the remarkably fully formed mantra they arrived on the scene chanting And while they could go darker grizzlier or even shinier ÅeI Love You[.]Åf achieves what few debuts can by making one hell of an opening statement Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian was more critical of the album's lyrical content assigning 3/5 citing Rutherford's petulant take on things obviously aimed at teenagers but the album's dreamy melancholy and high-shine production are just as likely to rope in their parents who may also appreciate the traditional songcraft behind every tune Kat Rolle of Drowned In Sound provides the album's most unforgiving review 3/10 stating From their British orthography to their monochrome Tumblr-friendly imagery and carefully orchestrated mysterious internet launch they are to all intensive purposes a carefully marketed boy band superficially combining indie and hip-hop influences with a touch of emo grunge thrown in but always setting up camp under the all-embracing banner of early teen-targeting pop
Note that the album tracklist appears to have undertaken dramatic edits prior to being released publicly as Kat Rolle comments on the late-stage change up of How which now appears as the album's opening track Jamie Milton also comments The album closes with a track called ÅeA Little DeathÅf though A Little Death does not appear anywhere on the album's final release


Edgar Meyer painter

Edgar Meyer 1853?1925 was an Austrian painter who built himself a castle and engaged in politics
Life
Professor Edgar Meyer was born on 5 September 1853 in Innsbruck Tyrol Austria His parents were Martin Meyer 1821?1897),(a prosperous businessman painter poet and compiler of folksongs and Theresia Megucher 1826?1905 He studied at the Akademie der Bildenkunste in Munich and from 1874 to 1878 at the Kunstakademie Dusseldorf under the direction of Eugene Ducker He extended his studies by visiting Rome and Venice In Dusseldorf between 1880?1881 he was a member of an association of artists and academics called Malkasten also known as Paintbox From 1886 as Professor he taught at the Kunstschule Weimar later Bauhaus University He was also Professor at Charlottenburg-Berlin
Meyer's preferred medium was watercolour and his impressionist styled landscapes mountain scenes and castles were popular particularly in Germany where they sold well Meyer's paintings can be found at the Tiroler Landesmuseum Ferdinandeum Innsbruck and in private collections around the world Towards the end of the nineteenth century the progression of Revolutionary Art caused his work to lose favour and he returned to the Tyrol
He bought the medieval ruins of Welfenstein Castle near Sterzing in South Tyrol During the period 1893?1897 he rebuilt the castle transforming it into a romantic edifice complete with numerous towers ramparts and battlements Meyer furnished the castle with antiques and works of art collected from throughout the Tyrol In November 1918 invading Italian troops burnt down the castle destoying most of its contents including a collection of forty thousand books
In 1910 Meyer co-founded the Tiroler Volkskunst museum Museum of Tyrolean Folk Art
He died at Aldrans near Innsbruck on 21 February 1925 aged 71
Political life
Edgar Meyer was a proponent of the germanisation of Trentino and the corridor beyond leading to the Adriatic Sea These areas contained a string of German-speaking communities This was against a backdrop of rising Italian nationalism or irrendentism
In 1905 Meyer co-founded the Tiroler Volksbundes Tyrolean Popular League Financed with German money it promoted Austrian culture and German teaching in South Tyrol and Trentino
In 1907 Meyer was the key player in a notorious episode that became known as Zweite Schlact von Calliano* The Second Battle of Calliano At the time Austro-German nationalist associations promoted their visions of national identity by organising tours and hiking parties Meyer had already organised several controversial tours then in the summer of 1907 he led a hiking party of German and Austrian nationalists through the Trentino This provocative excursion had been given advanced publicity in the press As they passed through Italian speaking villages they were met by hostile crowds On reaching Calliano an angry mob overwhelmed the protecting police and attacked the party resulting in some serious injuries There was outrage?anti-Italian demonstrations took place in Innsbruck the incident was widely reported in the Austrian and German newspapers and Austrian and German government officials lodged official complaints with the Italian government On the 5 August 1907 Meyer with a bandaged head spoke to an enthusiastic crowd in Innsbruck
In 1916?1917 Meyer founded the Ausschuss fur volkische Belange und deutsche Besiedlung Sudtirols Committee fot National Affairs and German Colonization of the Trentino
With his castle in ruins and following the annexation of South Tyrol by Italy in 1918 Meyer turned his attention towards the Jewish community in Austria In 1919 the Tyrolese Anti-Semitic Association was formed Meyer was one of the main speakers at its inaugural meeting in Innsbruck He cited Jewish subversion as one of the reasons for the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy


England and Wales Precipitation

The England and Wales Precipitation EWP record is a meteorological dataset which was originally published in the journal British Rainfall in 1931 and updated in a greatly revised form by a number of climatologists including Janice Lough Tom Wigley and Phil Jones during the 1970s and 1980s The monthly mean rainfall and snowfall for the region of England and Wales are given in millimetres from the year 1766 to the present though the original 1931 dataset went as far back as 1727
Data quality
The England and Wales Precipitation series for its earlier years was based on the work of amateur observers whose observations were collected by George James Symons in British Rainfall and analysed extensively in 1931 to form a monthly series as far back as 1727 Detailed analysis during the early 1980s showed by use of principal component analysis that England and Wales could be climatologically divided into five regions corresponding closely to present-day meteorological divisions however because of the absence of data from South West England between 1813 and 1816 and from North West England before 1766 the modern series begins in January of 1766 Separate data for each region of England go back only to 1873
Recent analysis suggests that the sparse data besides the absence of data from South West England for four years only one station was used per region until the 1820s from early years can lead to bias towards drier conditions since higher and wetter areas are not likely to be accounted for though no effort has yet been made to examine the data There has also been a suggestion that many of the very earliest values before circa 1780 and for a few years near 1800 and between 1809 and 1813 are rather too low compared to other estimates from A.F Jenkinson of the University of East Anglia
Trends revealed by the series
Research into the EWP series since it was compiled have revealed that overall annual rainfall has not changed significantly despite some suggestions of a rising trend but that winter half-year rainfall has substantially increased especially in the more northerly areas of England Up to 2000 summer rainfall especially in July and August over the southern parts of England showed a substantial decline however the very wet summers of 2007 and 2012 may suggest this is not a permanent change Nonetheless it is known that the maximum in rainfall during autumn typical of high latitude maritime climates has moved towards a later date since the 1960s especially compared to the 1890s
Extrema
Taking the 247-year period for the series as a whole


Jane Shin

Jane Jae Kyung Shin Korean ??? Hanja ê\çÀ˚Q is a Canadian politician who was elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in the 2013 provincial election She represents the electoral district of Burnaby-Lougheed as a member of the British Columbia New Democratic Party Shin is the first Korean Canadian elected to the provincial legislature
Early life and education
Shin was born in South Korea and emigrated to Canada when she was 11 years old Around her 16th birthday she was hospitalised for a serious health crisis which was attributed to leukemia or aplastic anemia According to Shin the experience made her a passionate advocate for Canada's health care system
Two months after her 16th birthday Shin was awarded $400 by the City of Surrey as part of their inaugural Youth Recognition Awards As a child Shin had volunteered for the Canadian Red Cross Society Greenpeace the Multicultural Society of B.C and many others
When my family's small ice cream store failed my parents in their 50s found the courage to go back to school and earn their credentials in health care Shin said in the Legislature My family is a testament to our fight to keep quality education accessible and affordable for all of us even for the oldest like my parents She added I'll be continuing that good fight in this Legislature for our students our families and our educators
Shin studied genetics and cell biology at the University of British Columbia for several years but did not receive an undergraduate degree Shin later completed a doctorate in medicine in 2007 from Spartan Health Sciences University in Vieux Fort St Lucia in the Caribbean an institution recognised by the Medical Council of Canada During medical school Shin performed clinical rotations at University of Edinburgh Dalhousie University and John H Stroger Jr Hospital Shin's rotation research at the Royal Victoria Infirmary of Newcastle upon Tyne co-authored two publications on chronic fatigue syndrome
Shin later decided that she preferred teaching over conventional medical practice and thus did not complete a residency necessary to gain a license to practice medicine in British Columbia Shin has taught at British Columbia Institute of Technology Vancouver Community College and West Coast College of Massage Therapy
Provincial politics
Shin's intention to seek the Burnaby-Lougheed NDP nomination under the party leadership of Adrian Dix was announced in May 2012 Shin's competitor for the nomination was Craig Langston Shin won the nomination in November 2012 ahead of the 2013 provincial election
During the campaign Shin faced allegations that she had misrepresented her educational credentials in her campaign materials although she quickly corrected the misunderstandings and clarified that they were not intentional
Shin defeated Liberal candidate Ken Kramer who replaced the retiring Harry Bloy who had held the riding for 12 years with 44.26% of the votes over Kramer's 40.59% and Green Party candidate Darwin Burns with only 8.23% and B.C Conservative candidate Christine Clark who ran unaffiliated due to a paperwork glitch earned just 6.92% of total votes The confusion during the campaign and Shin's subsequent election victory earned her the 2013 Newsmaker of the Year title from Burnaby Now
Shin is currently the deputy spokesperson for Trade Immigration and Multiculturalism in the Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet and serves on the Select Standing Committee for Health Shin had previously been assigned the Deputy Critic role for International Trade Asia Pacific Strategy Multiculturalism Immigration Intergovernmental Relations and prior to that Small Business Tourism and Arts and Culture
Shin's first motion was a private member's bill to permit electronic petitions from the public to be accepted by the legislature The bill was designed to enhance petitioning with increased accessibility and efficiency said Shin in Victoria ÅgElectronic petitions can serve as a low-barrier entry point for our citizens especially the youth to communicate their concerns to this House.Åh

The next day Harry and his nan take Abu on a personal guided tour around the nuclear power plant by the cleaner Ed and Kisko attempt to capture him again only for him to end up turned into a destructive giant caused by radiation which wears off shortly While walking on the beach they encounter Barney Cull a member of the Shell People He asks Harry and the others to save his people's children from a gift shop They succeed and they are invited back to the Shell People's cave where Harry falls for the Shell King's daughter Michelle He leaves after being unable to cope living under water They continue their road trip only to end up in a boxing match where Harry has to fight Kisko to keep Abu He successfully wins with a free stick of rock
Later on the car runs out of petrol in the middle of the woods and Harry and his nan leave Abu behind while they search for a petrol station He's almost kidnapped again by Ed and Kisko only to leave the car in pieces
Meanwhile Otto teams them up with a master of disguise fox Harry his Nan and Abu hitch a ride with Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez actually Ed and Kisko in disguise and they arrive in Blackpool to see a show
After they finally arrive there Harry is reunited with Michelle much to his Nan's dismay and Abu is finally kidnapped and replaced with the fox Harry later finds out and they go looking for Abu They follow a trail of steak barbecue hulahoops which is what Otto was left with to eat when he was abandoned to his hideout where he reveals his plan to turn Abu into a model figurine for his collection as an act of revenge for being deserted During a fight between the two Harry's nan reveals that she got rid of Otto because she kept getting him and Harry mixed up After being chased away by killer brains Harry and his nan are saved by the Shell People to which his Nan accepts his and Michelle's love Harry peruses his brother to the top of the Blackpool tower His Nan rescues him and Abu in a helicopter when Otto falls to the ground after taking a punch from Kisko after he and Ed thought they were working for the wrong brother After defeating Otto Abu coughs up a green felt tip pen which turned out to be the cause of his illness Ed explains that hamsters like sucking on pens and he gave it to Abu so he would be sick and start this whole plan Abu lives and the movie ends with a big end song with everyone in the film Just before the final credits a hamster appears on screen riding on a model train He gets off at the model station when the train stops The hamster can only be thought to belong to Harry Hill but there is no evidence for this
Critical reception
Critical reception for the movie were mixed to negative Ryan Gilbey wrote a review on The Guardian website saying What's missing is any persuasive comic force or vision to justify the film's place in cinemas rather than in petrol station bargain bins The Independent were also critical saying its screenplay wasn't so much offbeat as utterly feeble and it is very hard to keep patience with a story which hinges on the health of a toy hamster However Graham Young for the Birmingham Mail on a more positive note said Uniquely British and deliriously silly Harry Hill offers up the laughs It received a 33% rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes Tom Huddleston from Time Out gave it three stars saying this has bigger laughs and the set-piece gags are memorable however admitted ThereÅfs not enough here to sustain 88 minutes too many of the jokes fall flat but also said There will be those who find ÅeThe Harry Hill MovieÅf about as amusing as a trip to the dentist TheyÅfre wrong
Filming

Comprehension of idioms

Comprehension of idioms is the act of processing and understanding idioms Idioms are a common type of figure of speech Based on common linguistic definitions an idiom is a combination of words that contains a meaning that cannot be understood based on the literal definition of the individual words An example of an idiom is hit the sack which means to go to bed It can be used in a sentence like the following I'm so exhausted that I'm going to hit the sack now
Traditionally idiom comprehension was thought to require a distinct processing mode other than literal language comprehension Subsequent research suggested that the comprehension of idioms could be explained in the context of general models of comprehension Contemporary researchers have also posited that different modes of processing are required for distinct types of idioms Factors such as idiom familiarity transparency and context are found to influence idiom comprehension
Recent neurolinguistic research has found using various techniques several neural substrates that are associated with idiom comprehension such as the left temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex
History
Psycholinguistic research in idiom comprehension began in the 1970s Early research on figurative language typically assumed that comprehending figurative and literal language involved different kinds of processes The non-compositional models of idiom comprehension were constructed based on this assumption
Non-compositional Models
Non-compositional models in general assume that idioms are stored like long words in memory For example the entire phrase kick the bucket is represented by the meaning to die The words kick and bucket separately do not contribute to the idiomatic meaning Since individual words do not matter in an idiomatic expression they are thought to be processed together as one entity during comprehension In contrast processing a literal expression requires the meaning of each word to be derived and then perceived in relation to the other words in the phrase Non-compositional models include the literal first hypothesis lexical representation hypothesis and the direct access hypothesis
The Literal First Hypothesis
The Lexical Representation Hypothesis
The Direct Access Hypothesis
Criticisms of Non-compositional Models
There are several criticisms for the non-compositional models First studies demonstrated that idiom expressions are not processed more slowly than literal expression In fact it is often the opposite which is in contrary to the prediction of literal first hypothesis Second idioms have been found to be more than just Ågfrozen phrasesÅh or long words For example some idioms can be transformed to some extent and still be recognized and understood For example spill the beans can be used as Ågthe beans were spilt by MaryÅh This is possible because spill the bean can be mapped on the meaning Ågreveal the secretÅh i.e spill reveal and beans secret Such idiom shows that the internal structure of the word string matters during comprehension The meaning of some idioms like play with fire can be also inferred from literal interpretation of their components i.e to do something dangerous These findings reveal that idioms are not a homogeneous distinct group and thus may not involve different processing strategies from those for literal expressions
Compositional Models
Compositional models assume that idiom comprehension uses normal language processing When an idiomatic expression is encountered it is processed incrementally like a normal expression Components of an idiomatic word string contribute to a figurative meaning in either a literal or metaphorical way Compositional models include the configurational hypothesis and the conceptual metaphor hypothesis
The Configurational Hypothesis
The Conceptual Metaphor Hypothesis
Criticisms of Compositional Models
The prediction of the configurational hypothesis was not supported by research findings Researchers found that even after a word string is recognized as an idiom its literal meaning is still activated Another criticism of the compositional models concerns the role of familiarity in idiom comprehension As discovered by research on non-compositional models idiomatic expressions are processed faster than non-idiomatic expressions This is likely due to peopleÅfs familiarity of idioms This suggests that when highly familiar idioms are encountered people may not need to engage in literal processing or utilize conceptual metaphor to infer their meanings
Recent Models
Research in idiom comprehension continues today Non-compositional and compositional models both inform contemporary researchers One of the recent models includes the dual idiom representation model
The Dual Idiom Representation Model
Factors that affect Idiom Comprehension
Many factors have an effect on the comprehension of idioms They can influence the processing speed and understandability of the idioms Some of these factors include the familiarity transparency and context of use of the idioms
Familiarity
Idiom familiarity is typically defined as how frequently an idiom is encountered in a language community Subjective ratings of idiom familiarity are usually obtained from members of the language community An example of a more familiar English idiom is pain in the neck while a less familiar idiom is paddle his own canoe Research demonstrated that familiar idioms are processed quicker and more accurately than unfamiliar ones As the dual idiom representation model suggests highly familiar idioms may lead to direct memory retrieval Processing unfamiliar idioms on the other head requires contextual information and commonsense knowledge
Transparency
Idiom transparency can refer to the ÅgliteralnessÅh of an idiom how easy it is to understand an idiom based on the words it contains Idioms can be sorted depending on their degree of transparency Three categories of idioms have been identified decomposable abnormally decomposable and nondecomposable Decomposable idioms are composed of words that literally contribute to their overall figurative meaning e.g pop the question Pop refers to sudden and the question refers to marriage proposal Abnormally decomposable idioms contain words that are associated with the overall figurative meaning of the idiom but in a metaphorical way e.g spill the beans Spill mapping on to reveal and beans metaphorically representing secret Nondecomposable idioms are made of words that do not reflect their idiomatic meaning e.g kick the bucket People are found to respond to both types of decomposable idioms faster than nondecomposable ones
Context of use
Research in children highlighted the important effects of context on idiom comprehension It was found that children understand idiomatic expression more accurately when they are shown in informative contexts than when they are presented in isolation When they are encountered out of context children tended to interpret idioms literally The ability to use contextual information in language processing has also been found to influence childrenÅfs performance in idiom comprehension Adults however are more affected by the familiarity of the idiom
Neurolinguistic Research
Researchers have used various means to explore the brain regions that are associated with idiom comprehension The investigations involve examining brain damage patients and conducting transcranial magnetic stimulation rTMS and functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI studies Brain damages in the patients were mostly caused by strokes or traumatic accidents rTMS causes temporary cerebral lesion and thereby impairs the target areaÅfs functioning fMRI measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow The areas that have been studied include the right hemisphere left hemisphere and prefrontal cortex
Right Hemisphere
Since aphasic patients often preserve their ability to use familiar phrases i.e idioms and proverbs researchers hypothesized that they may be stored and processed in different brain regions than novel phrases It was found that patients who experienced right-brain damage RBD showed more impairment in idiom comprehension than patients with left-brain damage LBD RBD patients however performed better in comprehending novel sentence compared to patients with LBD This suggests that the right hemisphere is involved in the comprehension of idioms However later research has suggested that RBD patientsÅf difficulties in idiom comprehension as demonstrated by sentence-to-picture matching task may be due to deficits in their visuospatial abilities rather than impairment in linguistic processing The right hemisphere shows dominance in visuospatial processing
Left Hemisphere
Other researchers have hypothesized that comprehension of nondecomposable idioms mainly involved left hemispheric activity When healthy adults were studied left temporal rTMS was found to influence the reaction time and accuracy of both idiom comprehension and literal sentence processing In particular it increased processing time and reduced accuracy in understanding When rTMS was applied to the left frontal right frontal and right temporal there were no effects on idiom comprehension Recent research with healthy adults using fMRI also found that when processing idioms that were not literally interpretable i.e raining cats and dogs the BrocaÅfs area in the left prefronto-temporal network was activated However when literally interpretable idioms i.e break the ice were processed the left medial frontal gyrus MFQ and superior frontal gyrus SFG were activated
Prefrontal Cortex
Prefrontal cortex PFC is suggested to be important for idiom comprehension It may play a role in selecting the appropriate interpretation and suppressing the incorrect ones when an idiomatic expression is encountered Research using fMRI indicated that the left temporal cortex left superior medial frontal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus were activated when idiomatic phrases were presented In addition the right superior and middle temporal gyri the right temporal pole and the right inferior frontal gyrus were activated as well In contrast the left inferior parietal lobe and the right supramarginal gyrus were activated when literal sentences were presented
Future Research
Future research in this field should continue to investigate which brain regions are associated with idiom processing in order to resolve the ongoing debate on hemispheric specialization in figurative language comprehension A recent review suggested that the familiarity affect which brain region is activated during the comprehension of figurative language Less familiar expressions are suggested to be processed in the right hemisphere while more familiar ones are processed predominately in the left hemisphere More brain imaging research needs to be conducted to test this hypothesis
Additionally future research could use magnetoencephalography MEG to explore the temporal dynamics of idiom comprehension Recent research using MEG has found that when idioms containing action verbs i.e kick the bucket were processed motor regions of the brain were activated The anterior fronto-temporal cortex a region previously found to distinguish between literal and figurative processing was activated at the same time as well This suggests that literal and figurative meanings are processed in parallel to some extent which gives support to the configurational hypothesis More work with MEG should be done to verify these findings

Red Guards Russia

Red Guards were paramilitary volunteer formations consisting mainly of factory workers peasants cossacks and partially of soldiers and sailors for protection of the Soviet power Red Guards were a transitional military force of the collapsing Imperial Russian Army and the base formations of Bolsheviks during the October Revolution and the first months of the Civil War Most of them were formed in the time frame of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and some of the units were reorganized into the Red Army during 1918 The Red Guards formations were organized across most of the former Russian Empire including territories outside of the contemporary Russian Federation such as Finland Estonia Ukraine others They were not centralized and were formed by decision of a local party and Soviet authorities
General outlook
Composing the majority of the urban population they were the main strike force of several radically oriented socialist political factions Red Guard units were created in March 1917 at manufacturing companies by Factory and Plant Committees and by some communist-inclined party cells Bolsheviks Left Socialist Revolutionaries others The Red Guards formations were based on the workers strike forces of the Russian Revolution of 1905 Lenin gave a following evaluation of the phenomenon
A number of other militarized formations created during the February Revolution such as people's militia Ñ~ÑpÑÇÑÄÑtÑ~ÑpÑë Ñ}ÑyÑ|ÑyÑàÑyÑë created by the Russian Provisional Government squads of self-defence ÑÄÑÑÑÇÑëÑtÑç ÑÉÑpÑ}ÑÄÑÄÑqÑÄÑÇÑÄÑ~Ñç committees of public security Ñ{ÑÄÑ}ÑyÑÑÑuÑÑÑç ÑÄÑqÑãÑuÑÉÑÑÑrÑuÑ~Ñ~ÑÄÑz ÑqÑuÑxÑÄÑÅÑpÑÉÑ~ÑÄÑÉÑÑÑy workers squads ÑÇÑpÑqÑÄÑâÑyÑu ÑtÑÇÑÖÑwÑyÑ~Ñç were gradually unified into the Red Guards
Creation
On March 26 1917 the Bureau of the Central Committee of the RSDRP(b published a resolution About the Provisional Government since then the term Red Guards received the widest usage The biggest centralized Red Guards formations were created in Petrograd and Moscow Soon thereafter series attempts took place to legalize those formations On April 14 1917 the Moscow Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party Bolsheviks RSDLP(b adopted a resolution for creation of its Red Guard On April 17 in Petrograd the council of workers squads representatives created a commission for formation of workers guards and on April 29 in the Pravda newspaper has appeared a draft of its statute The Vyborg raion district council of Petrograd on April 28 declared to transform the squads of workers and factory militia into the Red Guard squads On May 17 the Samara council of workers representatives deputies at its session established a commission in creation of Red Guard squads A big role in creation of the Red Guard squads played the Factory committees Before the April of 1917 seventeen Russian cities have created Red Guard squads which by the June increased in numbers to 24
Red Guards were the base for the forming of the Red Army Therefore the term is often used as just another English name for the Red Army in reference to the times of the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War
In Petrograd the head of the Red Guards 30,000 personnel was Konstantin Yurenev At the moment of the October Revolution the Russian Red Guards had 200,000 personnel After the revolution the Red Guards performed some of the function of the regular army between the time the new Soviet government began demobilizing the old Russian military and the time the Red Army was created in January 1918
Organization
During the revolution training of the Red Guards was arranged by the Military Organization of the RSDLP
Enlistment was voluntary but required recommendations from Soviets Bolshevik party units or other public organizations The military training of workers was often performed without disengagement from the work at plants There were both infantry and mounted regiments At different places the organization was nonuniform in terms of subordination head count degree of military training This state was often called half-partisan While successful at local conflicts e.g with ataman Alexander Dutov in Orenburg guberniya this loose organization was inefficient when combating larger organized forces of the White Army Therefore when the creation of the Red Army was decreed Red Guards had become the Army Reserve and the base for the formation of regular military detachments


S v Vika

S v Vika an important case in South African criminal law was heard on May 12 2010 MM Xozwa instructed by the Justice Centre Grahamstown appeared for the appellant H Obermeyer DPP Grahamstown appeared for the State The case was an appeal against sentence imposed in a regional court
Facts
The appellant was convicted in a regional court on two counts of contravening section 1(1 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act The prohibited acts which constituted the contraventions were murder of one Batandwa Ndalase and attempted murder of one Sandasile Nxiki respectively Regarding the appropriate punishment the magistrate applied the provision that a contravention of section 1(1 could attract the same penalty as that which might be imposed for the unlawful act itself He found that no substantial and compelling circumstances existed that would justify a sentence of less than the fifteen years imprisonment stipulated in section 51(2 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act and proceeded to impose that sentence treating the two counts as one
Argument
The appellant appealed against the sentence on the grounds
Judgment
The High Court having reserved judgment held that it was clear from the address of the appellant's legal representative on sentence that she had been aware of the applicability of the minimum sentence provisions She had submitted that substantial and compelling circumstances were present and had not been surprised by the trial court's application of these provisions Accordingly the lack of reference thereto in the charge-sheet had not rendered the trial unfair
In its judgment on sentence the trial court had not mentioned the appellant's personal circumstances and had dealt only with the seriousness of the offences The magistrate seemed to the High Court not to have appreciated the difference between the offences of which the appellant had been convicted and the offences of murder and attempted murder These amounted to misdirections that entitled the High Court to interfere with sentence The appellant had a clean record His employment for which he was pursuing higher qualifications together with his support for his family showed that he was a useful and responsible member of society On the other hand his actions had had serious consequences including violent loss of life There was also a high incidence of alcohol-related assaults in society It was in society's interests that the courts be seen to impose sentences that would deter that kind of behaviour A custodial sentence the court found was the only appropriate one It emerged from a consideration of previous cases however that appreciably lower sentences were imposed than would have been if the relevant accused or appellants had been convicted of the underlying prohibited acts In casu a sentence of seven years imprisonment on the first count and four years on the second was appropriate Since the two offences had been closely linked in time and circumstance the sentences should run concurrently
The appeal was thus upheld The sentence of fifteen years imprisonment was set aside and replaced with one of seven years and four years imprisonment running concurrently


Yang Si-De

Yang Si-De born December 11 1921 in Nansha County|Nansha Tengzhou Shandong is a retired general of the People's Liberation Army and served as Minister of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the CPC Central Committee During this period he followed the Communist Party's peaceful One Country Two Systems policy to resolve the Taiwan sovereignty issue For his pioneering work and playing an active part in the great cause of the Reunification of the Motherland he received recognition and appreciation by former leaders such as Deng Xiaoping Yang Shangkun and other party and state leaders
Years of War
Yang Si-De was born on December 11 1921 in Nansha County|Nansha Tengzhou Shandong Province to an ordinary peasant family farming for a living for generations His parents are hard-working simple and illiterate peasants Yang's parents scrimped and saved in the hopes that they could provide a brighter future for Yang From childhood Yang Si-de witnessed landlords and reactionary officials oppression and exploitation of people from private school to public schools Yang Si-de studied hard all the while continuing to accept new ideas of the Enlightenment In 1938 he joined the Eighth Route Army and subsequently in the same year joined the Communist Party of China During the Sino-Japanese War Yang Si-De held a range of positions ranging from the military chief of Shandong's Political Department to deputy minister of the Shandong Military Liaison Department as well as many other major offices of significance
After The Formation of The People's Republic of China
After the founding of The People's Republic of China Yang Si-de was ordered to participate in the formation of the People's Liberation Army Air Force holding the post of political commissar During the Korean War Yang Si-de was deeply involved in the arduous task of defeating South Korea under the puppet Syngman Rhee and The United States He has thereafter long been engaged in work related to Taiwan He served as Vice Minister of the Liaison Department of the General Political Department Minister of the Central Taiwan Affairs Office member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference executive deputy director of the Macau Taiwan and Hong Kong Liaison Committee as well as other positions
Years of Revolution
Throughout the years of war Yang Si-de was mostly engaged in the infiltration of enemy lines and thus gained considerable experience in this field his life has been described as a thrilling saga and he has therefore been remembered as a Legendary General of the time
During The Eighth Route Army's Lunan Anti-Japanese volunteer campaign Yang Si-de was considered responsible for contact with the Railway Guerrillas leaving behind a legend because of this Yang took part such famous battles as the Laiwu campaign and after the Huaihai Campaign During the liberation of Nanjing on April 1949 during this time Yang Si-de served in multiple offices of significance including the political commissar of the Fourth Army's garrison in Nanjing Important contributions were made by the garrison of Nanjing during the initial stage of the liberation of Nanjing After the founding of the People's Republic of China Yang Si-de was ordered to participate in the formation of China's military Air Division serving again the post of political commissar
During the Cultural Revolution Yang Si-de was persecuted and was imprisoned for five years This however did not kill the excellent political meritocrat that Yang was he once said - the firm conviction of a Communist can never be vanquished After China's reform and opening up to the outside world Yang Si-de was once again caught in the implementation of new policies and was back to work again In May 1986 a cargo plane of Taiwan's China Airlines CAL flown by the captain Xijue landed at Guangzhou Baiyun Airport A group of central political leaders led by Yang Side proceeded to Hong Kong to negotiate with the Taiwanese authorities since then breaking the long-term adherence of the Taiwan authorities three noes no contact no negotiations no compromise solidified and opened a new cross-strait relations between the Chinese Mainland and Taiwan
Personal life
The Yang Si-de had two marriages in his life On September 1949 he married the East China Field Army column art troupe captain Wang Chengming This revolutionary couple met on the battlefield and were married following tradition People's Liberation Army marriage customs During the Cultural Revolution with Yang Si-de persecution Wang Chengming also tortured but the couple had always shared their weals and woes Wang Chengming died in October 1994 and Yang later married the general manager of the Sino-Japanese joint venture Sanno Dental Co Ltd Hsia Nan Yang Si-de elater published his memoirs of the Cultural Revolution the book was titled Historic Mission Now retired Yang Si-de is still very concerned about the development of the various undertakings of the nation During an interview with the general when Yang found out that the journalist was engaged in theoretical work at the Central Party in earnest to his request he stated You young people you should pay attention on two issues China's rural reforms and anti-corruption These two issues are priorities these remarks summarize the old general's sincere love to party and embody his never-waning love for his nation


DNOS

DNOS or Dell Networking Operating System is the new name for the operating system running on switches from Dell Networking It is derived from either the PowerConnect OS DNOS 6.x or Force10 OS/FTOS DNOS 9.x and will be made available for the 10G and faster Dell Networking S-series switches the Z-series 40G core switches and DNOS6 is available for the N-series switches
Two version families
The DNOS family comes in two main versions
DNOS9.x
Only the PowerConnect 8100 will be able to run on DNOS 6.x all other PowerConnect ethernet switches will continue to run its own PowerConnect OS on top of VxWorks while the PowerConnect W-series run on a Dell specific version of ArubaOS
The Dell Networking S- xxxx and Z9x00 series will run on DNOS where the other Dell Networking switches will continue to run FTOS 8.x firmware
Hardware Abstraction Layer
Three of the four product families from Dell Networking are using the Broadcom Trident+ ASIC's but the company doesn't use the API's from Broadcom the developers at Dell Networking have written their own Hardware Abstraction Layer so that DNOS 9.x can run on different hardware platforms with minimal impact for the firmware Currently three of the four DN switch families are based on the Broadcom Trident family while the 4th - the E-series- run on self-developed ASIC's and two of them are running DNOS 9.x S- and Z- series and if the product developers want or need to use different hardware for new products they only need to develop a HAL for that new hardware and the same firmware can run on it This keeps the company flexible and not dependent on a specific hardware-vendor and can use both 3rd party or self designed ASIC's and chipsets
The underlying OS on which DNOS 9.x runs is based on NetBSD while the DNOS 6.x runs on a Linux kernel an implementation which is often used in embedded networking-systems NetBSD is a very stable open source OS running on many different hardware platforms By choosing for a proven technology with extended TCP functionality built into the core of the OS it reduces time during development of new products or extending the DNOS with new features
Modular setup
DNOS 9.x is also modular where different parts of the OS run independent from each other within one switch if one process would fail the impact on other processes on the switch are limited This modular setup is also taken to the hardware level in some product-lines where a routing-module has three separate CPU's one for management one for L2 and one for L3 processing This same approach is also used in the newer firmware-families from Cisco like the NX-OS for the Nexus product-line or the IOS XR for the high-end routers the Carrier Routing Systems from Cisco and unlike the original IOS processes under IOS aren't isolated from each other This approach is regarded not only a way to make the firmwares more resilient but also increases the security of the switches
Capabilities
All DNOS 9.x based switches offer a wide range of layer2 and layer3 protocols All features are available on all switches some switch models in the S-series offer an additional license for layer3 or routing this additional license is NOT required to use that protocol but only required to get support from the Dell Networking support department on using these features All interfaces on DNOS 9.x running switches are configured as a layer3 interface and by default shutdown To use such an interface as an ethernet switchport you need to configure it as such with the command switchport and then enable that port using no shutdown
Unlike DNOS 6.x DNOS 9.x only offers a command line interface CLI to configure and monitor the switch directly though it is possible with the Automation Tools to create your own webGui on DNOS 9.x switches
Layer2 capabilities
All standarized ethernet standards are supported by switches running FTOS including Spanning Tree Protocol and RSTP VLAN and the IEEE 802.1Q standards QinQ or IEEE 802.1ad Link Layer Discovery Protocol and LLDP MED
The S-series switches ending with a V and some of the E-series line-cards support Power over Ethernet or PoE with the standards for this protocol
Layer3 capabilities
As mentioned above by default an interface on a switch running DNOS 9.x are configured as a layer3 port All these switches are thus routers with many interfaces that can and most often are reconfigured into a layer2 ethernet switch
All DNOS 9 switches run at least the following routing protocols Routing Information Protocol and RIP version 2 OSPF IS-IS and Border Gateway Protocol version 4
Open Automation
Under the name OpenAutomation 2.0 Dell Networking switches running DNOS 9.x offers a number of features under this name These features include
Smart Scripting
Dell Networking switches support so called smart scripting It is possible to develop scripts that run on the switches running DNOS 9 Both Perl and Python are supported as scripting languages to automate environment specific repetitive tasks or to build in custom behavior Users who write such scripts are promoted to share these scripts with the user-community and make them available to other Force10/DNOS users Force10 introduced the smart scripting in FTOS in 2010 following other vendors like Cisco for their Nexus product range
Bare metal provisioning
Dell Networking switches support a bare metal provisioning option if you need to deploy a number of similar switches you can put both desired/latest firmware release and standard user-specific configuration on a USB key when deploying the switches you can insert the USB key power-up the switch and it will automatically load the correct firmware and configuration In combination with smart scripting someone can combine these features for a fully automated installation and configuration of new switches It is also possible to run BMP via the network unless re-configured to start in normal mode all DNOS 9.x switches and the earlier FTOS switches will check if there is a BMP server on the network by sending out a DHCP/BOOTP request at boot if it gets the correct response from the DHCP server IP address address of TFTP server and a script/config file name it will contact a TFTP server to download correct firmware and configuration files and run that You can disable this feature during initial configuration so that the switch will boot from the firmware and configuration saved on the switch NVRAM memory
Virtual server networking
Part of the Open Automation platform are special features for the use of virtualisation in your datacenter Virtualisation allows you to create complete virtual server-systems running on a standard hypervisor farm This will create new challenges for networking in such a datacenter support automated configuration of datacenter switches to connect newly created virtual servers The open automation platform has several features to support this
Network Automation
According to Dell the move to server and datacenter virtualisation is one of the most important developments in the IT industry According to this vendor the industry must prevent that this path leads to getting locked-in into specific vendors due to the use of proprietary technologies The open automation framework is an open framework that doesn't rely on proprietary solutions
Alternative OS
On some models Dell Networking switches currently the S4810 and S6000 it is possible to run an alternative network OS Cumulus Linux This will run instead of DNOS on top of NetBSD Cumulus Linux is a complete Linux distribution which uses the full TCP/IP stack of Linux

Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh

The Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh is a five-year legally binding agreement between international labor organizations non-governmental organizations and retailers engaged in the textile industry to maintain minimum safety standards in the Bangladesh textile industry:The undersigned parties are committed to the goal of a safe and sustainable Bangladeshi Ready-Made Garment RMG industry in which no worker needs to fear fires building collapses or other accidents that could be prevented with reasonable health and safety measures
The accord was signed by the first group of companies in May 2013 and numerous companies joined later In October 2013 it was announced that 1,600 Bangladeshi factories were covered by the accord representing about 1/3 of the Bangladeshi textile industry
Creation of the accord
The accord was sponsored and created by the IndustriALL Global Union and the UNI Global Union in alliance with leading NGOs the Clean Clothes Campaign and the Workers Rights Consortium It is an expanded version of an earlier 2-year accord that had been signed only by PVH and Tchibo
Following the 2013 Savar building collapse on 24 April 2013 that resulted in over 1,100 deaths there was wide global interest by both the consuming public and clothing retailers in establishing enforceable standards for fire and building safety in Bangladesh The German government sponsored a meeting of retailers and NGOs at the beginning of May and the meeting set a deadline of midnight of May 16 2013 to sign up to the agreement Numerous companies had signed up by the deadline covering over 1,000 Bangladeshi garment factories
Terms
In addition to schemes of building inspection and enforcement of fire and safety standards the accord requires that contracts by international retailers with Bangladesh manufacturers provide for compensation adequate to maintain safe buildings Retailers agree to continue to support the Bangladesh textile industry despite possible higher costs It is estimated that the total cost may be $1 billion about $500,000 per factory Close cooperation with the International Labour Organization and the government of Bangladesh is required A steering committee which governs the accord is established as are dispute resolution procedures such as arbitration The accord calls for development of an Implementation Plan over 45 days
Participation
As of October 29 2013 the following companies had signed the accord
Rival American plan
Most North American retailers did not sign the accord Companies like Gap Inc and Walmart cited liability concerns According to spokespersons for the retail industry American courts which allow class actions contingent fees and do not require losing plaintiffs to pay legal fees might permit liability claims against retailers in the event of another disaster which might result in substantial enforceable judgments in contrast to European courts which generally do not allow class actions forbid contingent fees and require losing plaintiffs to pay winning defendants legal fees and costs However as John C Coffee professor of corporate law at Columbia Law School pointed out Kiobel v Royal Dutch Petroleum Co might apply thus foreclosing suits by Bangladesh workers under the Alien Tort Claims Act but this seems unlikely It is more likely that liability would be based on contract law
On July 10 2013 a group of 17 major North American retailers calling themselves the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety announced the Bangladesh Worker Safety Initiative The Initiative drew criticism from labor groups who complained that it was less stringent than the Accord and lacked legally binding commitments to pay for improvements


Khengarji I

Khengarji I 1496-1585 was a Rajput warrior Jadeja clan who was Ruler of Morbi from 1538-1585 and later became Ruler of Cutch State assuming title of Rao of Cutch ruling unified Cutch from 1548 to 1585
Lifesketch
Early life
Khengarji I was son of Jam Hamirji of Lakhiarviro Cutch chief of eldest branch of Jadeja and descendant of Othaji It is believed that Jam Rawal attributed the murder of his father Jam Lakhaji to Hamirji as he was killed within the territory of Lakhiarviro where he had been invited on the pretense of resolving the dispute between the two branches Jam Rawal in revenge treacherously killed his uncle Rao Hamirji in 1524 and ruled Cutch for more than two decades
In court of Mahmud Begada
At the time of murder of Hamirji his elder sons Alioji and Khengarji both were in Ahmadabad and escaped the complete destruction of the royal family of senior branch Further the other two sons of Hamirji were saved from execution by wife of Jam Rawal Khengarji was 15 years old when his father was murdered He enlisted himself in to the army of Mahmud Begada and became his confidante During one royal hunting party Khengarji I killed a lion and saved the life of Sultan Begada for which he was asked to name his reward
Ruler of Morbi
The prime ambition of Khengarji was to regain Cutch and hence he asked for support to fight Jam Rawal whereby he was given 1000 soldiers and fiefdom of Morvi and given a title of Rao by the Sultan Mohamad Beghda in 1538
Conquering of Cutch
Rao Khengar now based at Morbi with the support of army provided to him and well wishers within Cutch fought with Jam Rawal and slowly started gaining the territories of Rapar and nearby villages As Khengarji was the rightful heir to the throne he was welcomed within Cutch
On other hand Jam Rawal,was finding himself squeezed in terms of manpower He was ardent devotee of Ashapura the Kuldevi of Jadejas and folklore are that the Goddess indicated in a dream to Jam Rawal to leave Kutch and establish himself at Halar region and that she will support him in this venture Jam Rawal later escaped out of Cutch in 1548 when a large army was sent against him jointly by Mughals and Sultan Beghda to aid Khengarji He set out for Saurashtra with his retinue loyalist and soldiers faithful to him and established Nawanagar Thus throne of Cutch was left to Khengarji in 1548 who was its rightful heir
Rao of Cutch
Khengarji I thus expelling Jam Rawal assumed the title of 1st Rao of Cutch in 1548 and was crowned at Rapar but in 1549 he shifted the capital to Bhuj Khengarji I is also noted as he founded the united Cutch State He united Eastern Central & Western Cutch into one dominion which before him was ruled partially by other Rajput tribes like Chawdas Vaghelas Chauhans Kathis apart from the Jadejas Upon integration of Cutch in 1549 he shifted his capital to Bhuj a city established by his father Rao Hamirji in 1510 Further he expanded his territories beyond Cutch and conquered the territories of Santalpur and Chadchat near Palanpur and estate of Pandu Mehvas which took away from Sarkhaji the son of Lunaji Vaghela
Administration
He established Bhayyat system thus integrating his clan and to accept him as their ruler He gathered under him twelve Jadeja noble landowning families who were related to him as well as two noble families of the Waghela Rajput community Bhayyat is the term used for all the descendants of the royal family who own and control their own domains allocated to them within the state and adhere to the feudal system
He established the port of Mandvi in 1580
Death
He died at Bhuj in 1585 having had issue including two sons - Bharmalji I and Bhojrajji Khengarji of whom Bharmalji the elder succeeded him to throne of Cutch Bhojaraji became a Bhayyat and was given fiefdom of Kera Kutch after his death


The two kinds of righteousness

The Two Kinds of Righteousness is a Lutheran paradigm like the Two Kingdoms of God It attempts to define manÅfs identity in relation to God and to the rest of creation The Two Kinds of Righteousness is explicitly mentioned in LutherÅfs 1518 sermon entitled Two Kinds of Righteousness in LutherÅfs Galatians Commentary 1535 in his Bondage of the Will MelanchthonÅfs Apology of the Augsburg Confession and in the third article of the Formula of Concord It is also the implicit presupposition governing LutherÅfs Freedom of a Christian as well as other works
In theology Ågto be righteous is to be human as God envisioned in creation and again in redemption.Åh Lutherans believe that there are Ågtwo dimensions to being a human creature,Åh or two relationships that define human nature The first dimension defines manÅfs relationship with God and the second defines manÅfs relationship with his human neighbors and the rest of GodÅfs creation ÅgIn the former we receive righteousness before God through faith on account of Christ In the latter we achieve righteousness in the eyes of the world by works when we carry out our God-given responsibilities.Åh
Righteousness Coram Deo
The first kind of righteousness is righteousness coram deo righteousness in the eyes of God The Reformers also called it passive righteousness the righteousness of faith the righteousness of the Gospel alien righteousness and Christian righteousness Dr Robert Kolb has often called it the righteousness of identity because it restores manÅfs identity as a child of God
This righteousness Ågis a righteousness that we receive from God.Åh A person is righteous coram deo that is he is in a right relationship with God when he simply receives the imputed obedience of Christ and the forgiveness of sins through faith
This righteousness is passive and comes apart from the Law A human person is not righteous in GodÅfs eyes because of his choice or commitment his good works or his piety his emotions or intellect Instead he is righteous because the Father chooses him from the foundation of the world Eph 1:3-14 and declares him righteous on account of JesusÅf atoning death and justifying resurrection Rom.3:21-28 4:18-25 Thus Luther describes AbrahamÅfs righteousness of faith saying ÅgThe other kind of righteousness is the righteousness of faith which does not depend on any works but on God's favorable regard and his reckoning on the basis of grace Christian righteousness is freely given by the Spirit through the means of grace i.e baptism the proclamation of forgiveness on account of Christ the LordÅfs Supper
In his sermon Two Kinds of Righteousness 1518 Luther compares this alien righteousness to marriage When a man and a woman are married they share all things in common Through faith man is married to Christ ÅgThrough faith in Christ therefore ChristÅfs righteousness becomes our righteousness and all that he has becomes ours rather he himself becomes ours.Åh
Works Righteousness
ManÅfs relationship with God has always been defined by GodÅfs promises and faith Even before the fall into sin Adam and Eve were righteous in GodÅfs eyes not because of their obedience but because God declared them good and they believed Faith has always defined righteousness coram deo Thus righteousness before God cannot depend on human achievement or merit Such an idea was a sheer impossibility for Luther
Law and Gospel
The important and popular Lutheran paradigm of Law and Gospel fits within this first dimension The Law can only accuse and condemn sinners Any attempt to justify oneself before God with human achievements is an affront to God The Law condemns such attempts reveals manÅfs guilt and crushes his pride The Gospel brings free forgiveness and raises the sinner to new life In this dimension the Gospel has the final word
The Implications for Pastoral Ministry
When a pastor teaches his people that man is made righteous in God's eyes through faith alone he gives all glory to the Lord for saving mankind The Lutheran Reformers knew that any talk of justification by works would lead to pride Furthermore Luther and his colleagues believed that preaching passive righteousness gives complete comfort It leaves the sinner fully confident that God is his loving Father and that Jesus is his merciful Lord despite his sin
Righteousness Coram Mundo
The second kind of righteousness is righteousness coram mundo righteousness in the eyes of the world The Reformers also called it active righteousness civil righteousness proper righteousness the righteousness of the Law and the righteousness of reason or philosophy Dr Robert Kolb has often called this kind of righteousness the righteousness of character because it deals with a personÅfs attitudes and behaviors
A person is righteous coram mundo when he is in a right relationship with the rest of creation and this is done through manÅfs actions Thus a righteous parent is a parent that cares for her child a righteous student is a student who studies hard and respects his teachers a righteous citizen respects the government and pays his taxes etc
This righteousness is active that is Ågthe righteousness of works is a righteousness that we achieve by human ability.Åh Thus this righteousness is informed by the Law i.e the good will of God Unlike the first dimension where the Law only accuses in the second dimension the Law acts as a guide The Law shows man how God designed the world to work and warns that there are often temporal consequences to sin Ultimately Ågthe purpose of a righteousness of works is the welfare of this world,Åh and not manÅfs relationship with God
The righteousness of the Law is defined by a personÅfs vocation God does not expect the same kinds of works from all people Furthermore this righteousness extends to all of creation Humans have responsibilities to the entire earth and not just their human neighbors
The Imperfection of Civil Righteousness
Man is capable of doing great things for his neighbor through his reason and strength However these good works are imperfect tainted by sinful desires and impure motivations Thus Luther constantly stressed how active righteousness cannot merit salvation ÅgPlease notice here too the distinction Paul makes by referring to a twofold righteousness of Abraham First there is the righteousness of works or moral and civil righteousness but he denies that Abraham is justified in God's sight by this even if he is righteous in the sight of men because of it With this righteousness he has indeed something to boast about before men but like the rest he falls short of the glory of God.Åh
The Importance of Good Works
While manÅfs commitments and actions cannot earn GodÅfs eternal favor and salvation they are God-pleasing in the sense that God cares for the temporal wellbeing of this world and he is pleased to work through the works of man to care for his creatures
Furthermore this second dimension of human existence allows a positive use of the Law i.e the Third Use of the Law and for the study of Ethics Before God the Law only and always accuses because of manÅfs sin but before the world the Law is a helpful guide that instructs men who are ignorant deceived by the flesh or the culture or who are stuck in a moral dilemma
The Two Kinds of Righteousness paradigm not only prevents works righteousness and synergism but it also prevents licentiousness and antinomianism Through this paradigm Lutherans are capable of confessing both Divine Monergism i.e God alone is responsible for salvation and human responsibility In other words salvation by grace alone through faith alone does not take away manÅfs responsibilities within the world
A Third Kind of Righteousness
The Lutheran Reformers spoke of active righteousness in two ways
First they often spoke of active righteousness as something believers and unbelievers have in common Not only Christians but also Muslims Jews Buddhists and Atheists are capable of being faithful spouses loving parents and hard-working employees Christians and non-Christians perform many of the same external civil works They often share a common understanding of Ethics Thus Melanchthon can praise AristotleÅfs Nicomachean Ethics as being the best work on civil righteousness ever written
However the Reformers also spoke of active righteousness in reference to the new obedience of Christians alone Thus the Formula states It is correct to say that in this life believers who have become righteous through faith in Christ have first of all the righteousness of faith that is reckoned to them and then thereafter the righteousness of new obedience or good works that are begun in them But these two kinds of righteousness dare not be mixed with each other Also Luther defines active righteousness in his 1518 sermon as the Ågproduct of the righteousness of the first type actually its fruit and consequence.Åh
Because of this some Lutheran theologians such as Dr Joel Biermann have recommended speaking of a third kind of righteousness?the active righteousness of a Christian resulting from the work of the Spirit
There is value in talking about two kinds of righteousness and three kinds On the one hand the active righteousness of a Christian and of an unbeliever is the same for both do the same external works in the same vocations For example a person cannot tell the difference between a faithful Christian employee and a faithful non-believing employee by sight In a certain respect a ChristianÅfs active righteousness is different only because the sin that taints it has been forgiven In other words the righteousness coram deo sanctifies the righteousness coram mundo
On the other hand the Bible does make a distinction between the active righteousness of believers and the active righteousness of unbelievers In the end only the good works of Christians are God-pleasing On the Last Day Jesus will praise only the works of the sheep and will only condemn the works of the goats Matt 25:31-46 Furthermore the Spirit works within the Christian after conversion The Spirit gives the Christian virtuous holy desires commonly called the fruits of the Spirit and crucifies his sinful flesh The Spirit-led Christian eagerly looks to the Law of God which no longer can accuse his conscience so that it may guide him whereas the non-believer always seeks guidance from man-made laws and philosophies that are full of error In other words Christian righteous will lead to new obedience
Both ways of describing active righteousness are biblical and were used by the Lutheran Reformers Therefore it is acceptable to speak of either two kinds of righteousness or three and it is also acceptable to define active righteousness as the works done by both believers and unbelievers or as the new obedience that occurs after conversion
Other References to Two Kinds of Righteousness
The Lutheran theologian Francis Pieper briefly mentions the Two Kinds of Righteousness paradigm in his Christian Dogmatics
ÅgIn the terminology of Luther there are Åetwo kindsÅf of forgiveness of sins or of justification the ÅeinternalÅf and the Åeexternal.Åf The internal justification takes place through the gracious promise of the Gospel and through faith which lays hold of this promise External justification takes place through the good works of Christians which as the consequence and fruit of the internal justification prove to men that internal justification is there.Åh
Theologians outside of the Lutheran Church have also noted and used this paradigm For example Jonathan Edwards mentions the Two Kinds of Righteousness paradigm in a famous sermon on justification
ÅgThere is a two-fold righteousness that the saints have an imputed righteousness and Åetis this only that avails anything to justification and an inherent righteousness that is that holiness and grace which is in the hearts and lives of the saints This is ChristÅfs righteousness as well as imputed righteousness imputed righteousness is ChristÅfs righteousness accepted for them inherent holiness is ChristÅfs righteousness communicated to them They derive their holiness from Christ as the fountain of it He gives it by his Spirit so that Åetis ChristÅfs holiness communicated Åetis the light of the sun reflected Now God takes delight in the saints for both these both for ChristÅfs righteousness imputed and for ChristÅfs holiness communicated though Åetis the former only that avails anything to justification.Åh

One year later at the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing China Bera won a bronze medal in the 100 m freestyle at 51.79 trailing China's Xie Jun by almost a full second
College career
Shortly after the Games Bera accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the Arizona State University in Tempe Arizona where he played for the Arizona State Sun Devils swimming and diving team under head coach Michael Chasson While swimming for the Sun Devils he received four All-American honors in the 100-yard freestyle and all freestyle relays 200 400 and 800 To further focus on his collegiate career Bera decided to scratch out from any international tournaments including the Olympics and the Asian Games In his senior season Bera turned himself into a professional swimmer and then made a strong comeback for the Indonesian swimming team At the 1995 Southeast Asian Games in Chiang Mai Thailand Bera powered past the entire swimming field to strike a sprint freestyle double both 50 and 100 m
International comeback
After an eight-year absence from Seoul as a 16-year-old Bera qualified for his second Indonesian team at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta Although he was able to improve his standards from past tournaments Bera still placed in a middle-of-the-pack in any of his individual events finishing forty-fourth in the 50 m freestyle 23.80 and thirty-fourth in the 100 m freestyle 51.25
When his nation Indonesia hosted the 1997 Southeast Asian Games in Jakarta Bera was delighted and overwhelmed by the home crowd as he edged out Filipino favorite Raymond Papa to defend his titles in both the 50 and 100 m freestyle Shortly after the Games Bera announced his retirement to concentrate on his job as an assistant coach for the Arizona State Sun Devils On that same year he graduated from the University with a bachelor of science degree in political science major in economics
Two years later in 1999 Bera made a decision to come out of retirement and set up an official return to the Indonesian swimming team At the Southeast Asian Games he defended his 100 m freestyle title for the third straight time in a record-breaking time of 51.03 slashing 0.28 seconds off the mark set by his teammate Wisnu Wardhana in 1993 In the 50 m freestyle Bera added another gold to his 4-year-old hardware in 23.49 more than two-tenths of a second 0.20 outside a 10-year-old record
At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney Bera competed again in a sprint freestyle double since his remarkable comeback from Atlanta After defending third straight titles from the SEA Games his entry times of 23.49 50 m freestyle and 51.03 100 m freestyle were accredited under a FINA B-standard In the 100 m freestyle Bera placed thirty-seventh on the morning prelims Swimming in heat six he edged out Israel's Yoav Bruck to take a sixth spot by exactly a tenth of a second 0.10 in 51.52 Two days later in the 50 m freestyle Bera challenged seven other swimmers in heat five including Bahamas Allan Murray top 16 finalist in Atlanta four years earlier He came up short in third place and forty-second overall at 23.54 just a small fraction off his entry time
At the 2001 Southeast Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia Bera matched his own record of 51.03 to claim a 100 m freestyle title for the fourth straight time edging out host nation's Allen Ong by 0.28 of a second
Twelve years after winning a bronze medal Bera competed for the second time as a strong 31-year-old veteran at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan South Korea He missed the podium twice in any of his swimming events finishing fourth in the 50 m freestyle 23.49 and fifth in the 100 m freestyle 51.41
At the 2003 Southeast Asian Games in Hanoi Vietnam Bera won a bronze medal in the 50 m freestyle at 23.73 finishing behind surprising Thai teenager Arwut Chinnapasaen and his Malaysian nemesis Allen Ong by four-tenths of a second 0.40
Sixteen years since his debut Bera made his final appearance as a swimmer at the 2005 Southeast Asian Games in Manila He won a total of three swimming medals a single gold in the 100 m freestyle 51.94 and two silvers each in the 50 m freestyle 23.36 and in the 4Å~100 m freestyle relay 3:29.46 Shortly after the Games Bera announced his second yet official retirement from swimming ending a career with three Olympic appearances and more than ten SEA Games medals to his collection
Life after swimming
Since 2000 Bera has been working as a sports broadcaster for MetroTV on the western outskirts of Jakarta and also as an editor-in-chief for FHM and Men's Fitness Indonesia Magazine Following his retirement from swimming Bera still remained strong and faithful to his sport regime He became a founder of Millenium Aquatics Club and a full-time member of Fitness First Indonesia and later competed in both Olympic and sprint-distance triathlons across Indonesia specifically in Bali
Bera also attended both as a spectator and a visitor at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London Watching the athlete procession from the stands during the closing ceremony he reminisced an Olympic moment from his Twitter Seeing all those athletes down there abit emotional for me I used to be down there

SyntheSys Research

SyntheSys Research was a Silicon Valley test equipment company that existed from 1989 to 2010 located in Menlo Park California The company was founded by Tom and Jim Waschura with technical help from other ex-Ampex employees Rob Verity and Kirk Handley The first product was a 160 Mbit/s bit error rate tester BERT called the BitAlyzer 160 that debuted in 1989 The company patented key technologies used in modern signal integrity test notably Error Location Analysis and statistically deep eye-diagramming integrated with BERT measurement called BERTScope The company was the first to combine Jitter sources in its test signal generators to permit popular Stressed-Eye testing The company developed many products over its 21-year span including specialty products for disk-drive television high-definition television optical telecommunications and computer applications In 2010 SyntheSys Research was purchased by Tektronix a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation in an M&A transaction and the BERTScope and BitAlyzer instruments became product lines in Tektronix's high-speed Oscilloscope divisions
Founding
The company was founded by Tom and Jim Waschura identical twins who formerly worked for Ampex Corporation in Redwood City California Tom Waschura's electrical engineering degree from M.I.T landed him a job at Ampex's Data Systems division working on tape recording and early parallel-transfer disk drives Jim Waschura's software engineering background proved useful in Ampex's Video Systems division working on still stores used for broadcast television especially news production Tom left Ampex and the brothers created a partnership called Designware Associates to assist a fledgling company called Systems West create the first polar-orbiting satellite image retrieval system for commercial boating and fishing Later Tom recalled a senior engineer at Ampex John Corcoran working to add digital communications channels to analog tape recorders that Ampex manufactured John and Tom employed a device known as a Bit Error Rate tester BERT that generated a pseudo-random series of bits to record and later to be played-back into the BERT device that verified that the bits had been reproduced correctly This effort was undertaken about the same time early personal computers were becoming available known as PC/AT or 80286-based personal computers Whereas the BERT device indicated the number of bits that were incorrectly reproduced it became clear that the effort of implementing a digital communications channel on an analog tape recorder would be greatly helped if it were clear which bits were in error -- not just the quantity of the erred bits -- and it seemed the new powerful personal computers ought to be able to do this This became the genesis of Error Location Analysis technology that was later patented and implemented in all BitAlyzer and BERTScope products and that was licensed to Hewlett Packard Company now Agilent Technologies who implemented it in their popular 86130 3.0 Gbit/s BERT instrument
The first BitAlyzer was developed in the garage of a residence in the Emerald Hills area of Redwood City owned by Bob Haya Rob Verity and Kirk Handley each a former co-worker of Tom Waschura's developed hardware modules while Tom Waschura developed the system design and Jim Waschura developed the software Bob Haya is credited with coming up with the name BitAlyzer The company was incorporated as SyntheSys Research because DesignWare was not available for use The first patent was filed on Error Location Analysis technology The company moved to a small business park in Redwood City California where it resided for about a year before finally moving to Edison Technology Park in Menlo Park California
Key Technologies
Error Location Analysis
Error Location Analysis became a cornerstone technique for diagnosing problems with digital communications by identifying the precise location of bit-errors during a bit error rate testing session Fundamental bit error rate testing is accomplished by comparing a communicated bit-stream with a reference correct bit-stream The correct bits may be stored in a memory device or synthesized in real-time as reception of the communicated bit-stream occurs It is common for these bit-streams to contain pseudo-random binary sequence PRBS patterns that permit easy synchronization with just a few correctly received consecutive bits This self-synchronizing feature of PRBS patterns make them ideal for BERT testing Traditional BERT devices possess generators that produce test bit-streams for output and detectors that receive test bit-streams and count the number of bits being received and the number of mis-matches between the received and the reference bit-streams Using the simple formula
the BER is calculated Error location analysis extends these fundamental features by employing a hardware memory device that effectively stores the value of the received bit counter whenever a mismatching error is detected This produces a stream of error locations that are processed in real-time and/or stored for post-processing Many types of statistical processing algorithms were developed by SyntheSys Research producing a comprehensive set of error location analysis tools
Error location analysis tools
One of the earliest uses of 2D Error Mapping was applied to the recorded errors from a transverse-scan digital tape recording device made by Ampex Corporation The accompanying Media Scan image demonstrates that error locations are key to recognizing that multiple error-producing syndromes are occurring simultaneously and affecting the total bit error rate experienced during the test recording session
This technique is described in U.S Patent US6636994 B1
Run-time Delay Calibration
Being able to position a data signal relative to a clock signal with very high resolution and accuracy is an important capability in a BERT This feature is used on the output of a data generator to ensure the clock signal rising edge corresponds to the middle of the data signal's bit window since both signals will use different cabling and routing and can be mis-matched The capability is also used on the receiver side of a BERT where a separate delay device is used to evaluate BER when the clock signal is not perfectly aligned in the middle of the data signal's bit cell As the clock signal approaches either side of the data bit cell window the quantity of errors will rise and the steepness of the rise is based on the amount of jitter between the clock and data signals This type of analysis is called a Bathtub Curve which demonstrates a degree of system margin This is an example of a signal integrity physical-layer test utilizing BER measurement capability combined with accurate time delay capability
There are numerous electronic circuits that will produce delay ranging from different lengths of circuit-board traces that produce fixed amounts of delay to voltage-controlled circuits that produce programmable amounts of delay It is usual to combine fixed and variable portions with switches that enable different components when needed Depending on manufacturing tolerances temperature and data-rate however the amount of delay achieved by a particular route may vary Previous methods for building delay capabilities involved factory calibration of every combination of fixed and variable elements at all operating temperatures and data rates This provided adjustment data that could be used to select and program fixed and variable elements to achieve a desired amount of delay for a given operating condition
SyntheSys Research engineers Andre Willis-Poskatcheev Clint Fincher and Tom Helmers developed a circuit sub-system for precisely measuring delay at run-time requiring a few seconds to evaluate precise delay for all combination of fixed and variable elements in the current operating environment This capability was an important selling-point especially when utilized to produce eye-diagrams on very fast signals
This technique is described in U.S Patent EP 1560333 A3
Eye-diagramming on a BERT
BERT instruments are often found near oscilloscopes because they complement each other The BERT provides the bottom-line capability of determining if digital bits are being communicated effectively but if they are not the oscilloscope provides the ability to see the underlying analog waveform used to communicate the digital bits It is common for underlying analog problems such as timing jitter or amplitude noise or slow rise-time to translate into digital bit errors Beginning in a digital television product called the DVA184-C and then following with the high-definition video product HDVA-292 and every BERT product afterwards SyntheSys Research engineers integrated the ability to display the analog eye-diagram of the signal being evaluated
The notable advantage of this approach is two-fold First precisely the same electronic circuits and components that are used to produce the BER measurements are also used to produce the eye diagram display This ensures that the differences between how two separate circuits would interpret the signal ? owing to their unique frequency responses ? are eliminated and there is perfect correlation between BER results and eye diagram results which is very important and impossible to do otherwise Second the mechanism invented by Tom Waschura to create the eye diagram utilizes a counter and a variable-threshold comparator in some instances two comparators to image the eye By selecting different threshold levels in combination with certain time delays individual pixels of the eye diagram are evaluated by counting the number of bits that exceed the threshold ? or in the case of dual thresholds are in between two thresholds This capability is important because the speed of the evaluation is dependent on the clocking speed of the transmission that is often hundreds of times faster than the sampling rate of an oscilloscope This is an important advantage in signal integrity test applications where it is difficult to capture low-probability occurring events
Based on deep measurements of a two-dimensional grid the BERT instrument was capable of making common waveform measurements such as rise time jitter amplitude and so on
This technique is described in U.S Patent EP 1315327 A3
BER Contour
By combining eye diagramming techniques with precisely positioned BER measurements Jim Waschura invented a technique of sweeping the interior of an eye diagram to curve-fit measurements to mathematical models representing the interior slopes of the eye diagram for random and deterministic effects This technique is notable because many performance criteria are defined in terms of the eye opening at a specified probability level e.g 1E-12 that requires an impossible amount of data acquisition to measure directly This technique allows for modest extrapolations to be performed to evaluate the 1E-12 eye opening with measurements that are acquired in only a few minutes
This technique also became a very powerful means to communicate the strength of the BERTScope's eye diagramming capability since it demonstrates how eyes that appear open if sampled to a shallow depth - such as those sampled by contemporary oscilloscopes - very quickly could become closed if the underlying problem was a random process such as jitter or noise See the accompanying picture and compare how wide open the middle eye diagram appears versus how quickly the eye width shrinks with longer test intervals because of the random jitter and the low slope of the contour it produces
Stressed-Eye Testing
During the analog to digital transition that occurred during the life-span of SyntheSys Research many techniques were employed by engineers to evaluate digital transmission Analog transmission had been characterized by modestly simple measurements of the analog waveform such as rise-time signal-to-noise ratio and frequency response Digital transmission however employed sophisticated coding and error correction and other mechanisms that could perfectly recreate digital bits even if the underlying analog waveform was quite bad and made it much more difficult to have a single qualitative figure of merit for the performance of the digital transmission BER was a very useful measure but it didn't degrade politely like analog signal-to-noise measurements In digital communications a cliff-effect occurs which means communication is often perfect until it fails completely
Early digital testing was focused on the transmitter to ensure that the waveform transmission characteristics met a standard set of characteristics for parameters such as rise time amplitude jitter and so on It was assumed that if the signal originated correctly and was communicated well that the receiver would interpret it properly and reproduce the correct bits This was often augmented with modest frame-based checksum approaches for the receiver to finally validate the BER of what it had received
As transmission rates increased however it became important to allocate the system performance margin between both the transmitter and the receiver and this produced new requirements to evaluate the receivers in the communications system Each standards-body and groups of engineers approached this problem differently Early digital television standards were the first to employ testing with a 100 meter length of cable later replaced by an electronic circuit called a cable clone to validate that the signal may be received properly when used under stress 10 Gb Ethernet and other standards employed jitter and noise-producing circuits to electronically degrade the transmission and produce a Stressed-Eye for testing It became very important to have multiple sources of different types of amplitude noise and time-domain modulated jitter sources to produce a calibrated cocktail of degradations that would close the transmitted eye for receiver testing but making calibrated jitter and noise sources required difficult engineering that had to be reproduced exactly each time receiver testing was to be performed In 2005 with the introduction of the BERTScope 12500-S SyntheSys Research provided the first built-in stressed-eye sources that greatly assisted engineers in performing popular stressed-eye receiver testing
ECC Emulation
To increase communications channel data rates common techniques are applied such as speeding up clocking rates and increasing the dimensions of modulation and increasing coding efficiencies Ultimately channels become so optimized they are operating at the extents of their physical limitations and in these cases improving reliability is done by adding Forward error correction FEC also known as Error Correcting Code ECC capabilities that trade the overhead of transmitting extra information with the advantage of being able to correct errors during transmission To design efficient FEC strategies it is important to know the profile of the raw errors in the underlying channel and Error Location Analysis proved very helpful for this purpose Features like Burst Length Histogram helped engineers choose FEC interleave depths and features like Block Error Histogram indicated the correction strengths required for full correction
The Error Location Analysis feature aimed at the FEC application was called ECC Emulation Using this feature the system could be configured to produce full-range error analysis of a raw communications channel as-if it had a specified FEC architecture operating on it FEC architectures were specified by configuring the number of rows and columns and tables in a hypothetical 3-dimensional interleave FEC system together with correction strengths in each dimension The system also enabled activity monitoring for each layer of correction capability to observe headroom when operating on live or pre-recorded raw error sessions

Bootstrap and Venture Backing
From 1989 through 2004 the company was bootstrap funded by proceeds from selling products In 1999 the company entered into a license agreement with Agilent Technologies to license the company's Error Location Analysis intellectual property and patents and assist Agilent by implementing these features inside the Agilent 86130 BERT This inflow allowed the company to grow but more-importantly allowed it to continue developing products through the 2001-2003 economic hard-times known as the Telecom disaster related to the internet Dot-com bubble During this time many of Agilent's customers were affected and ultimately Agilent itself was restructured and the Lightwave Division in Santa Rosa who was the main proponent of the 86130 BERT product line containing SyntheSys Research Error Location Analysis technology was closed Due to these economic factors SyntheSys Research was able to get rights back to the licensed technology and began producing BERTScope products for sale
In 2003 Tom and Jim Waschura were visited by Dr Lutz P Henckels who had been the CEO of LeCroy Corporation where he had been successful with a public stock offering After considerable time analyzing the state of SyntheSys Research's team technogy and markets The three concluded that growth opportunities warranted stepping-up the momentum of SyntheSys Research by raising venture capital and targeting BER testing for 10 Gbit/s Ethernet optical and other high-speed serial communications channels and devices Dr Lutz P Henckels became CEO in 2004 to execute this strategy
In 2004 the venture capital arm of the Boston-based Advent International private equity company invested in series-A preferred stock and the board of directors were changed to provide Advent with two board of directors positions This lasted throughout the remaining lifespan of the company
During the next five years the company developed important BERTScope products with integrated stressed-eye and physical-layer testing capability and introduced innovative accessory products including the Digital Preemphasis Processor and Clock Recovery that led the market It increased investments in sales channel and marketing activities and was successful at establishing BERTScope as an important brand in high-speed BERT test
Acquisition by Danaher-Tektronix
In 2008 the largest maker of Oscilloscopes in the United States Tektronix of Beaverton Oregon and SyntheSys Research signed an OEM agreement to sell the SyntheSys Research CR12500 clock-recovery instrument through Tektronix's sales channel This was important because Tektronix sold an equivalent-time ÅesamplingÅf form of oscilloscope that required a very good time reference input and contemporary high-speed signals were outpacing the existing Tektronix clock-recovery capabilities The Tektronix engineers sales engineers and customers were pleased with the high-performance of the SyntheSys Research clock-recovery units This relationship provided both organizations some view into the other and as BERT testing became an important feature for high-speed customers and because Tektronix did not possess their own BERT test instrument in 2009 the two companies initiated merger discussions that were finalized early in 2010 with an acquisition
Within Tektronix Brian Reich was the main proponent of the acquisition and he became the general manager responsible for the successful business and technical integration of SyntheSys Research into the high-performance oscilloscopes division of Tektronix Other hands-on roles were fulfilled by Dan Morgan Joy Conley John Calvin and Jit-loke Lim During the transition SyntheSys Research product manufacturing was moved to Oregon and engineering and sales were moved into a newly opened Tektronix Silicon Valley design center in Santa Clara California


The Cove House Inn

The Cove House Inn is an 18th-century public house on the Isle of Portland Dorset England It is situated within the village of Chiswell and lies next to Chesil Beach on the esplanade The Cove House Inn remains one of Portland's most popular pubs and has been reputed to be one of the best inns for panoramic views in the area The pub has been a Grade II Listed Building since May 1993
History
Before the pub there were three fishermen cottages on the site The pub was later named after the treacherous cove where so many ships were wrecked The current building has been recorded as being early 19th century although there is also evidence that the building has origins from the late 17th to early 18th century Despite its particularly close position to the beach the pub survived during a particularly brutal storm which became known as The Great Gale of 1824 This storm destroyed a good amount of the surrounding Chiswell village
The pub's position has also linked it with various events relating to shipwrecks on Chesil Cove When two ships the SS Avalanche and the SS Forest collided off Portland Bill in September 1877 the pub played a notable role The 12 survivors rescued from Chesil Cove were initially taken to the pub for attention and afterwards the pub remained on the lookout for any further survivors The landlord Joe Way and his family also helped move any fatalities washed up on the beach to the nearby Ranter's Lodge which was known as the dead house Mrs Way would later receive a donation of Åí5 as a reward for the aid and care she gave to the survivors as well as her motherly regard to the poor bodies
The pub was also a focal point for important meetings on the island During the 19th century the pub was used for meetings on supplying assistance to those suffering from the effects of local storms the establishment of a Portland lifeboat and for the protest against catching fish with the use of dynamite charges The latter had become national news in 1877 In January 1870 the pub was the meeting point of the Weymouth Lifeboat Committee and a group of local Portland fisherman This was organised in the hope that a lifeboat was to become established on the island Though the Weymouth committee assured a lifeboat would be under full control of the fishermen who were knowledgeable of the coastline the local men were largely content with their own methods in regards to the rescue of those aboard any foundering ships along Portland's part of the coast
Due to the position of the pub vicious storms have caused flooding and damage to the building The village of Chiswell has suffered from sea flooding for centuries Between 1958 and 1965 work was completed on the protective sea wall and esplanade to help protect the village Further defences were installed in the 1980s and this included wire-mesh baskets filled with pebbles These measures have reduced flooding incidences within the village and the pub In past storms the sea has been recorded as smashing open the pub's door and roaring into the bar as well as throwing pebbles onto the roof
In December 1989 the Cove House Inn suffered major damage in a storm despite the installation of new sea defences shortly beforehand After the storm the pub remained forlorn for a short time the windows were covered with rusty grills and the name board was lost from the front of the building There was no porch at the time The pub managed to reopen three months later as the building's basic structure still remained in good condition Around this time the pub largely advertised the Devenish Brewery ales In early 2014 a number of damaging storms saw Chiswell village in the national news In February 2014 prime minister David Cameron arrived at Portland to show support for those affected by the storms During his time on the island he visited The Cove House Inn
Design
The pub is built with large square dressed Portland stone blocks and has slate roofs and stone stacks The main central unit extends one bay to the right and one bay to the left at a lower level with a number of additions at the rear stepped down to a lower access level The centre block of the house has 3 storeys and a 20th-century porch with door To both the left and right is a four-pane sash over a broad recessed mid 20th century window The left gable includes an early 19th century small nine-pane sash in the gable The interior was modified during the 20th century and there are substantial dressed stone walls in the basement possibly part of an earlier building on the site Outside of the pub is an outside seating area overlooking Chesil Beach and the rugged cliffs of Portland peninsular
Noted in the 1975 book Better Pubs in Dorset the long open windows of the pub are shuttered in the winter storms for protection Inside is old oak furniture and pictures of wrecks These is also some carving on the bar backing


Oxyjulis californica

Oxyjulis californica is a species of wrasse native to the eastern Pacific Ocean along the coasts of California and Baja California Its distribution extends from Salt Point in Sonoma County California to southern central Baja California near Cedros Island It is a very common species its common name in Spanish is senorita
This fish can grow to in total length Its body is fusiform frequently described as cigar-shaped It is brown or shiny bronze dorsally and orange on its sides becoming paler ventrally The base of the tail fin is mostly covered with a large black or chocolate brown spot The mouth is small and it has protruding buck teeth which it uses to scrape tiny invertebrate prey items off of kelp
This fish lives in near-coastal marine habitats especially kelp forests and reefs It has been observed at depths of but it generally lives at or less It may cruise in a small school but if threatened it often retreats to the bottom digging into the substrate to hide It also rests on the bottom at night burrowing in backwards so only its head sticks out of the substrate
The diet of the fish is composed of invertebrates including marine worms bryozoans crustaceans dove snails limpets fish larvae and squid It may consume small amounts of seaweed It also feeds on the ectoparasites of other fish The senorita is a cleaner wrasse a fish that grooms the parasites and other materials off the bodies of other fish It may remove and eat ectoparasites such as bacteria copepods and isopods Parasites can constitute around half its total food intake Sometimes when the senorita begins to clean one of its clients a crowd of other fish will gather around to receive the service Species that seek the senorita for a grooming include the bat ray Myliobatis californica giant sea bass Stereolepis gigas kelp bass Paralabrax clathratus jacksmelt Atherinopsis californiensis topsmelt Atherinops affinis sargo Diplodus sargus blacksmith Chromis punctipinnis garibaldi Hypsypops rubicundus opaleye Girella nigricans halfmoon Medialuna californiensis and mola Mola mola The other fish may solicit the cleaning with their behavior The garibaldi extends its gill slits to give the senorita access to parasites on its gills The blacksmith points its head down to encourage the cleaner and many blacksmith at a time may mob it competing for its attention They may even block its escape if it tries to leave the scene The opaleye is usually constantly swimming but it will stop and hold still if it meets a senorita The kelp bass a predator of small fish will often refrain from eating the senorita and let it clean While the senorita will often clean large predatory fish it is not always safe It has been observed in the diet of the kelp bass the bocaccio Sebastes paucispinis and the starry rockfish S constellatus but it is not consumed as often as would be expected considering its frequent close contact with predators It might be unpalatable Predators that do eat the fish include Brandt's cormorant Phalacrocorax penicillatus and the California sea lion Zalophus californianus
The reproductive biology of this fish is not well known Some sources suggest it may be a protogynous hermaphrodite with the female able to change sex and become male while others doubt this occurs in this species Spawning occurs in May through August The eggs are pelagic floating suspended in the water
The fish tends to return to favorite locations in one experiment senoritas were caught and then released a distance away and most found their way back to their original home ranges
Fishermen generally do not seek this species as quarry and it can be an annoyance when it steals bait off hooks While technically edible it is not valuable as a food fish


Lubbe v Volkskas

Lubbe v Volkskas is an important case in the South African law of lease
In October 1987 the appellant brought an urgent application before a single judge in which he applied for an order
It was common cause that the respondent's intention as mortgagee had been to sell the land subject to the lease and if the property did not realise the amount of the judgment debt then free of the lease
Judgment had been obtained by the respondent against the owner in January 1986 on a mortgage bond registered over the farm in 1983 and the property had been attached in March 1986 In May 1987 the owner had entered into a partiarian lease agreement with the appellant in terms of which the latter had obtained occupation of part of the farm and upon which he had subsequently cultivated the wheat crop
The appellant's application was dismissed inter alia on the ground that the appellant did not have a lien over the proceeds of the sale in execution The sale in execution took place in October 1987
The appellant bought the land himself in order to protect his rights His appeal to the Full Bench was dismissed whereupon he appealed to the Appellate Division
The court held that it had been common cause at the time of appellant's original application that it had been the respondent's intention to sell the land first subject to lease and only if the amount of the judgment debt was not realised free thereof and that this was in complete accordance with the common law as well as with the established legal procedure in sales in execution
Furthermore the court held that if the land was sold free of the partiarian lease agreement the appellant's averred lien would lapse and the holders of real rights of security in the land would become preferent creditors in respect of the proceeds of the sale
It was only where the appellant as lienholder elected to lay claim to part of the proceeds and the deputy sheriff had to decide whether or not to allow it that an application for a declaratory order as to the existence of the lien as prayed for in prayer 1 became necessary
The court held that it was clear that prayer 1 had been intended to serve as a precursor to prayer 2 The contents of prayer 2 were however contrary to the above- mentioned common-law principles and procedures applicable in sales in execution
Accordingly the appeal had to be dismissed with costs


Diana and Antoinette Powell-Cotton

Early life
Diana was born in 1908 and Antoinette in 1915 They were two of the children of Percy Powell-Cotton and his wife Hannah Powell-Cotton Additionally Diana and Antoinette had two other siblings Mary 1910?1998 and Christopher 1918?2006
Diana studied at the Royal College of Art where she gained valuable skills in drawing watercolour and sketching
Antoinette did not undertake any formal training but showed an interest in anthropology in her teens This led her to volunteer in the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford in the early 1930s under the direction of Henry Balfour who was the curator of the Pitt Rivers Museum at the time
First expeditions
Diana travelled with her father to the Sudan in 1933and then organised her own expedition to the Italian Somiliand in 1934?1935.She kept precise field notes and also filmed domestic activities such as butter-making She also used the artistic skills to make fine pen drawings of everyday objects she collected In addition to volunteering with the Pitt Rivers Museum Antoinette also helped at the Powell-Cotton museum at her home In 1935 she took her first trip to Africa with her father During this trip to Zululand she developed an interest in women's activities and much of what she recorded related to practices such as hairdressing and jewellery
Angola and Namibia 1936 and 1937
In March 1936 the sisters started their first trip to Angola.The aim of the trip was to document the lives traditions and customs of indigenous peoples They were concerned about the impact of European colonisation and wanted to record customs and traditions before they were lost When they arrived in Africa they bought a truck which they used for getting around between areas of interest For example in preparation for their 1937 trip they purchased a number of books which included maps dictionaries and copies of the New Testament in native languages They also took several anthropological books To gain permission for the trip they had to justify their costs The trips were expensive and had to cover the purchase of a truck buying native objects petrol and food In total the cost of each trip excluding return trips came to four hundred pounds At this time Namibia was under control of the South African government and Angola belonged to Portugal In preparation for their work in Angola the sisters familiarised themselves with Portuguese.Their final collection of objects shows a particular preference for Ovambo artefacts which is high compared to the other objects collected from other groups
Work undertaken
They both wrote field notes on their expedition as a way of recording their work and observations These included detailed descriptions of objects as well as traditions and rituals they observed As part of their work they also collected objects of interest Often these objects had been in use already They made precise lists of the objects they collected One example was their observations of plans used in medical practice For every plant they recorded what its purpose was the location it was found and who it was used by The sisters bought most of their objects when they visited villages and communities Often the natives lacked experience of selling objects and putting a price on possessions The sisters did not always find it easy to buy things from the locals who sometimes did not want to sell Altogether their final collection of artefacts totalled almost 2000 on their first trip and 1000 on their second
The sisters used film as a means of documenting family life and traditional customs of the people they were observing In total they shot over four hours of film on a Kodak camera One example of this is A Typical Day in the Life of a Kwanyama Family which shows everyday life in a traditional village Several of their films were shown at the Royal Anthropological Institute and were shown to the public at the Powell-Cotton museum In addition the British Film Institute was a recipient of several of their films They also took many photographs of objects people and places to help document their work in addition to their fieldnotes and objects they collected Most of the film and photography work was done by Diana
Diana and Antoinette only had one piece of work published from the expeditions This was an article called Feminine Coiffure in Angola Much Adorned Girls of West Africa which displayed a number of photographs of adornments worn by women The article was published in the Illustrated London News in 1937 They were subsequently approached to write an account of their expeditions for a general audience but they declined as they wanted any published work to be academic
Despite this their artefacts and images were sought after by other institutions For example Joan Lillico from the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum in London asked the used Diana and Antoinette's fieldnotes and photographs for her own research Additionally they gave portions of the objects and artefacts they brought back as well as some of their fieldnotes to several museums These included The British Museum the Pitt Rivers Museum and the Cambridge University Museum of Archeology and Anthropology
Later life
In 1939 when World War II broke out Diana and Antoinette both volunteered in war hospitals in London Diana trained as a doctor and Antoinette trained as a nurse Neither of them married Diana later moved back to Africa to practice medicine She then moved to the Rift Valley in 1967 to continue her photography and died in Norfolk in 1986.<br>Antionette helped work for the Powell-Cotton Museum alongside her nursing Between 1938 and 1974 she undertook some big local excavations and helped contribute to the content of the Powell-Cotton Museum


Henry Neikirk

Henry William Neikirk 1839?1911 was a Colorado gold miner banker and Republican politician serving in the Colorado General Assembly from 1879 to 1881 He was also instrumental in establishing the University of Colorado
Early life and education
Henry William Neikirk was born to Manasses and Mary Neikirk in Elkhorn Grove Illinois on November 27 1839 After receiving a basic education from the local district school he attended the Mount Carroll Seminary later known as Shimer College from 1858 to 1860 After leaving the Seminary he read law with prominent local attorney William T Miller The legal profession evidently did not appeal to him however for in 1861 he headed west for the mountains
Business and political career
Upon his arrival in the West Neikirk established the first trading post at Alkali on the Platte River 230 miles east of Denver The following year he moved into the mountains as a prospector During the ensuing years he alternated between prospecting and working for wages in the mines In 1867 he discovered the Hoosier Lode although he had to wait until the 1870s before he had accumulated enough money to exploit it
In 1868 Neikirk married Emily Virden They had six children Their eldest daughter Fannie also went on to attend her father's alma mater the Mount Carroll Seminary
Neikirk moved his residence to Boulder in 1875 remaining based there until his death From 1875 to 1880 he operated the Melvina Mine near Salina Colorado The Melvina was regarded as one of the very best of the telluride gold ore mines in this period Although not one of the original discoverers Neikirk obtained a share in the mine before its value became known His technical expertise was key to the mine's success Neikirk and the other original owners of the mine lost their shares in a hostile takeover by the Scottish-Colorado Mining & Smelting Company in 1883
In 1878 Neikirk stood for election as a Republican to the Colorado State Senate he defeated the Democratic candidate by 400 votes despite a two-year organizing campaign by the Democrats He served in the 2nd and 3rd general assemblies from 1879 to 1881 In the 3rd General Assembly he held the powerful chairmanship of the state senate's Finance Ways and Means committee In this capacity he secured funding for the use of state militia against striking workers in the Leadville Miners Strike
The 1898 Colorado State Mining Directory lists Neikirk as the owner of the Freiburg Mine located in Gilpin County it had been developed to 2,500 feet Other mines in which he had an interest included the Sunshine Black Swan Golden Sheen Maveric and Gold Farms mines
In addition to being president or director of numerous mining companies Neikirk also served for fourteen years as vice-president of the Boulder State Bank
Neikirk died of heart disease at his home in Boulder Colorado on February 15 1911 He was survived by his wife and all of their children


House sculpture

House was a temporary public sculpture by British artist Rachel Whiteread completed in East London on 25 October 1993 and demolished eleven weeks later on 11 January 1994 The work won Whiteread the Turner Prize for best young British artist that year She also received the K Foundation art award for worst British artist in 1994
Background
Whiteread had previously exhibited her sculpture Ghost a plaster cast of the inside of a room in a Victorian house at the Chisenhale Gallery in 1990 House was conceived as a similar work on a larger scale encompassing not just a single room but an entire house The work was commissioned by Artangel and sponsored by Beck's Beer and Tarmac Structural Repairs It was intended that the selected house would have been already scheduled for demolition and that the work would be temporary but the structure had to be free-standing so it would be visible from all sides
After some initial discussions in 1991 and 1992 when other locations in London were considered a Victorian terraced house in East London was selected for the work and a temporary lease was granted by the local council of 193 Grove Road in Mile End E3 near the old Roman road from London to Colchester The house was formerly part of a terrace but some of the buildings on the road were destroyed by bombing in the Second World War and later replaced by prefabricated dwellings
By the 1990s the area had a diverse social mix with churches from three different denominations nearby The local buildings comprised a mixture of Victorian terraces and villas with high-rise blocks of flats from the 1960s and later and the development at Canary Wharf was visible in the distance The area was in the middle of an extensive redevelopment and the local authorities decided to demolish the terrace to create a new park beside Roman Road and Grove Road Sid Gale the last residential occupier of 193 Grove Road opposed its demolition and continued to live in the house while the remainder of the terrace was demolished leaving his house and the ones to either side but he was eventually persuaded to move out
Creation
The work was a concrete cast of the inside of the entire three-story house basement ground floor and first floor including stairs and bay windows but not the roof space After Whiteread took possession of the building in August 1993 new foundations were created to support the new concrete Internal structures such as sinks and cupboards were removed holes in the walls filled and the windows covered to prepare a continuous internal surface that could be sprayed with a debonding agent then a layer of locrete coloured light grey and then a final layer of concrete reinforced with steel mesh The builders left through a hole in the roof which was then sealed and the external brick-built structure was removed
The casting took place from August to October 1993 and the work was opened to the public on 25 October 1993 Being so heavy the work was exhibited at the former location of the original house on the edge of a new public park Wennington Green and beside Grove Road The other houses in the terrace had already been demolished by Tower Hamlets London Borough Council
Reception
House became a popular visitor attraction with thousands of visitors per day Graffiti was later added on one side reading Wot for with the enigmatic reply Why not It received rave reviews from critics but was described as a monstrosity by the chair of the local council A petition demanding it remain permanently received thousands of signatures within hours
The work won Whiteread the Turner Prize in late 1993 but the council confirmed the decision to demolish it the same day passed by the casting vote of the chairman of the planning committee The controversy was compared to that over the public sculptures by Jacob Epstein and Eric Gill with the fate of the work recalling Richard Serra's Tilted Arc in New York
The thin structure of House was demolished within two hours on 11 January 1994 and nothing remains


List of Late Roman provinces

This article presents a list of Roman provinces in the Late Roman Empire as found in the Notitia Dignitatum
Praetorian prefecture of Galliae
In Latin Gallia was also sometimes used as a general term for all Celtic peoples and their territories such as all Brythons including Germanic and Iberian provinces that also had a population with a Celtic culture The plural Galliae in Latin indicates that all of these are meant not just Caesar's Gaul several modern countries
Diocese of Galliae
Galliae covered about half of the Gallic provinces of the early empire
Diocese of Viennensis
Viennensis was named after the city of Vienna now Vienne and almost entirely in present-day France roughly south of the Loire It was originally part of Caesar's newly conquered province of Transalpine Gaul but a separate diocese from the start
In the fifth century Viennensis was replaced by a diocese of Septem Provinciae 7 Provinces with similar boundaries
Diocese of Spain
Hispania was the name of the whole Iberian Peninsula It covered Hispania and the westernmost province of Roman Africa
Diocese of Britanniae
Britanniae was again a plural
Praetorian prefecture of Italy and Africa western
Originally there was a single diocese of Italia but it was eventually split into a northern section and a southern section The division of Italy into regions had already been established by Aurelian
Diocese of Italia suburbicaria
Suburbicaria indicates proximity to Rome the Urbs capital city It included the islands not considered actually Italian in Antiquity hence they were provinces while the peninsular regions still had a superior status given their different ethnic stock e.g Sicily was named after the Siculi and history of piracy
Diocese of Italia annonaria
Annonaria refers to a reliance on the area for the provisioning of Rome It encompassed northern Italy and Raetia
Diocese of Africa
Africa included the central part of Roman North Africa
Praetorian Prefecture of Illyricum
The Prefecture of Illyricum was named after the former province of Illyricum It originally included two dioceses the Diocese of Pannoniae and the Diocese of Moesiae Constantine I later split the Diocese of Moesiae into two dioceses the Diocese of Macedonia and the Diocese of Dacia
Diocese of Pannonia
Pannonia was one of the two dioceses in the eastern quarters of the Tetrarchy not belonging to the cultural Greek half of the empire the other was Dacia It was transferred to the western empire when Theodosius?I fixed the final split of the two empires in 395
Diocese of Dacia
The Dacians had lived in the Transylvania area annexed to the Empire by Trajan However during the invasions of the third century Dacia was largely abandoned Some inhabitants evacuated from the abandoned province settled on the south side of the Danube They renamed their new homeland Dacia to diminish the impact that abandoning the original Dacia had on the Empire's prestige The diocese was transferred to the western empire in 384 by Theodosius?I probably in partial compensation to the empress Justina for his recognition of the usurpation of Magnus Maximus in Britannia Gaul and Hispania
Diocese of Macedonia
The Diocese of Macedonia was transferred to the western empire in 384 by Theodosius?I probably in partial compensation to the empress Justina for his recognition of the usurpation of Magnus Maximus in Britannia Gaul and Hispania
Praetorian Prefecture of Oriens
As the rich home territory of the eastern emperor the Oriens East prefecture would persist as the core of the Byzantine Empire long after the fall of Rome Its praetorian prefect would be the last to survive but his office was transformed into an essentially internal minister
Diocese of Thrace
Thrace was the eastern-most corner of the Balkans the only part outside the Illyricum prefecture and the European hinterland of Constantinople
Diocese of Asiana
Asia or Asia Minor in Antiquity stood for Anatolia This diocese the name means the Asian ones centred on the earlier Roman province of Asia and only covered the rich western part of the peninsula mainly near the Aegean Sea
Diocese of Pontus
Pontus is the Latinized form of Greek Pontos the name of a Hellenistic kingdom which in turn is derived from the Euxine Pontus the Greco-Roman name of the Black Sea
It mainly contains parts of Asia minor near those coasts as well as the mountainous centre but also includes the north of very variable border with Rome's enemy Parthia/Persia
Diocese of Oriens
The Eastern diocese shares its geographic name with the prefecture even after it lost its rich part Egypt becoming a separate diocese but militarily crucial on the Persian Sassanid border and unruly desert tribes
It comprised mainly the modern Arabic Mashriq Syria Lebanon Iraq Israel the Palestinian Territories and Jordan except for the desert hinterland
Further it contained the southeastern coast of Asia Minor and the close island of Cyprus
Diocese of Aegyptus
This diocese comprising north eastern Africa?mainly Egypt the rich granary and traditional personal domain of the emperors?was the only diocese that was not under a vicarius but whose head retained the unique title of Praefectus Augustalis It was created by a split of the diocese of Oriens
All but one the civilian governors were of the modest rank of Praeses provinciae
Apart from modern Egypt Aegyptus also comprised the former province of Cyrenaica being the east of modern Libya an ancient name for the whole African continent as well Cyrenaica was split into two provinces each under a praeses


Chadbourn Spanish Gospel Mission

The Chadbourn Spanish Gospel Mission is a Mission Revival building from the Conejos District of Colorado Springs Colorado The building is on the National Register of Historic Places
Beginning in 1930 the church and mission provided religious educational sports and mission services to the members of the Conejos District It was supported by members of Protestant Churches which formed an advisory team that managed acquisition of funding for the mission
It was founded by Ruth Chadbourn a missionary who had moved to Colorado Springs for her health
Conejos District
The Conejos District was an area in Colorado Springs that was home to a Mexican community beginning at the turn of the 20th century who had moved to the area to work at the nearby Denver & Rio Grande Railroad mills and mines Many members of the Hispanic community came from the San Luis Valley They moved into an area that had been home to people of Scandinavian and Jewish heritage who moved to other areas of the city
The district lies between Colorado Avenue and Mill Street to the north and south The eastern and western borders are the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad yard and Monument Creek Families lived in frame houses on narrow lots and there were stores in the neighborhood to serve the community
The Chadbourn Spanish Gospel Mission is the only structure that remains from the district
Church and mission
Built in 1910 it was a frame building used first as a grocery store It began being used as a mission in 1930 and was named the Spanish Gospel Mission The mission was founded by missionary Ruth Chadbourn who worked in Costa Rica and moved to Colorado Springs in the 1920s for her health It was created to support the community with a high crime rate and poor living conditions The building was rented in 1930 and purchased in 1934 by Chadbourn and trustees of the mission Members of Protestant Colorado Springs churches formed an advisory board to help manage the finances of the organization and arrange for funds for the mission Chadbourn died in 1936 and subsequently the mission was named for her
After it was renovated in 1939 to 1940 to the Spanish Mission style it was a non-denominational church and mission that helped community members and was a community and education center A bell tower donated by Colorado College and curvilinear parapets were added to the church and among other modifications it was stuccoed The First United Methodist Church donated stained glass panels Its architecture has been described as follows
The buildingÅfs Mission Revival style is exemplified in its square bell tower curvilinear parapets overhanging eaves exposed rafter tails arches and stucco finish
Church services were performed in Spanish and English The church held Bible and Sunday School classes Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts met at the church Children could play on the church's basketball and baseball teams Adult education courses in music sewing and English language It provided food and Christmas gifts to neighborhood children and was a place for community events
An article was written in The Gazette said of the mission
This neighborhood badly needs such work for there are many children and youth crowded into small houses with no playground except the street Character
building agencies are much cheaper than the cost of juvenile delinquency This enterprise has shown what inter-denominational and inter-racial understanding and good will can do
In 1954 the homes and buildings in the district were demolished and the property was used for commercial and light industrial purposes In 2005 America the Beautiful Park was completed across Ciminio Drive from the church at the corner of Conejos and Ciminio Drive The mission has remained and conducts weekly church services It is no longer funded by other congregations Its congregation includes the grandchildren and children of the earlier church members
In 2008 The Gazette reported that the congregation was slowly growing and had plans of expanding the church building A rezoning of the building allows the church to obtain grants for the construction Becoming listed with the National Register of Historic Places helps to ensure the historic preservation of the church

Grey Cairns of Camster

The Grey Cairns of Camster are two large Neolithic chambered cairns located about south of Watten and north of Lybster in Caithness in the Highland region of Scotland They are among the oldest buildings in Scotland dating to about 5,000 years ago The cairns demonstrate the complexity of Neolithic architecture with central burial chambers accessed through narrow passages from the outside They were excavated and restored by Historic Scotland in the late 20th century and are open to the public
Location
The cairns which are considered to be examples of the Orkney-Cromarty type of chambered cairn were constructed in the third or fourth millennium BC in a desolate stretch of boggy peat-covered moorland in the Flow Country of Caithness They consist of two structures standing apart known as Camster Round and Camster Long A third cairn located about away from Camster Round is not considered to be part of the grouping The cairns are located just to the west of a minor road built in the 19th century to link Watten and Lybster Camster Burn runs in a north-south direction about to the west of the cairns while the Loch of Camster is located a short distance to the east Although the surrounding countryside is now inhospitable and sparsely inhabited during the Stone Age it was fertile farming land and only became covered in peat during the Bronze Age
Description
Camster Long
Camster Long is a long cairn with horns at each end aligned in a NE-SW direction It is twice as wide at one end than the other the width of the horns differs from at the north-east end to at the south-west end It reaches a maximum height of at over its two burial chambers about apart which are respectively situated about two-thirds of the way along the cairn starting at the south-west end and adjoining the north-east end The two chambers appear to have originally been constructed within separate round cairns which were only later incorporated into a single long cairn for unknown reasons
The chambers are both entered via passages leading from the south-east side of the cairn The west chamber consists of two compartments each delineated by upright portal stones standing high The first compartment has a maximum width of while the second is by When the tomb was excavated both compartments were found to contain human bones mingled with broken and unburnt animal bones from horses oxen pigs and deer
The entrance to the east chamber is located from the north-east end of the cairn and consists of a passage high by long The first is straight and mostly intact though the inner end is roofless and broken down At the point where it reaches the chamber the passageway turns through 45o through a portal made from two upright slabs The chamber is in the shape of an irregular pentagon in diameter rising to a roof closed by a single square stone set above the floor There may be a third as yet undiscovered chamber at the south-west end suggested by the presence of exposed upright stones which may indicate the presence of a portal
Camster Round
Camster Round is as the name suggests a circular cairn it measures in diameter by high Its form may be similar to that of the original separate round cairns that were later amalgamated into Camster Long It is virtually intact with a high vaulted chamber at its centre accessed from a passage long and high at the east-south-east side of the cairn The passage appears to have been deliberately put out of use by blocking it up with stones piled up to the height of its roof When it was excavated archaeologists found that the floor of the cairn was composed of a deep layer of black earth ash and burnt bones It appears that bodies were placed there in a sitting position though oddly without leg bones the legs appear either to have been removed or to have rotted off before the bodies were deposited in the cairn
Archaeology
The first archaeological investigations of the cairns was carried out between 1865?6 by Joseph Anderson and Robert Shearer who investigated a total of seven chambered tombs in Caithness including the two at Camster The Camster Round Cairn was investigated in 1865 followed by the Camster Long Cairn in 1866
Between 1966-1968 limited studies were carried out by P.R Ritchie where some debris was removed and preparatory work was done for the purpose of conservation Large-scale studies were subsequently carried out between 1971?3 by John Corcoran However his illness and death during the excavations meant that the results of his work were not published Lionel Masters took up the task of completing the excavation and carrying out archaeological research and conservation between 1976?80 The task of consolidating and restoring the cairns was finally concluded in 1981

Echo complement

Echo complement is a syntactic constituent that has either an anaphoric or a metonymic relation with another constituent in the same sentence
The term seems to have been used firstly by Guillet and Leclere 1981 pp.?116?117 in the setting of the operation of NP restructuring that is a transformation linking the sentence types N1 of N2 V = N2 V Prep N1 e.g ÅeThe style/architecture of this house is very impressiveÅf = ÅeThis house is very impressive by/for its style/architectureÅf
The concept implies that the notion of appropriation Harris 1976:113-115 between N1 v.g Åestyle/architectureÅf on one hand and N2 as argument of V v.g ÅehouseÅf and Åe(be impressiveÅf on the other hand which results from the metonymy between N1 and N2
Though briefly noted the term was then used to designate a type of prepositional complement that renders more ÅgpreciseÅh while recovering at least partially the meaning of the utterance our translation
Even then the authors considered the notion could be extended to other types of prepositional complements such as
- moi-meme ÅemyselfÅf in JÅfai fait ca de/par moi-meme ÅeI have done this myselfÅf where a redundant reflexive pronoun reinstates the subject NP or
- in JÅfai un apartment a moi ÅeI have my own apartment/I have an apartment of my ownÅf where a redundant/emphatic oblique pronoun in French recovers both the subject NP and the possession relation of avoir Åeto haveÅf
The same term and analysis are more recently retaken by Laporte 2004
In another work Guillet and Leclere 1992 p.?109 the authors use the term in yet another syntactic setting v.g mettre du beurre sur = beurrer Åeto put butter over/on = to butterÅf where mettre put is analysed as a support-verb This relation however could correspond to the Fusion operation Theoretical considerations apart the relevant observation is that the verbal sentence allows a prepositional complement with the noun whence the verb is derived V-n This complements usually zeroed unless it is given a specifying modifier e.g Max beurre sa tar tine de de beurre sale/de ferme ÅeMax buttered his toast with salted/farm butterÅf
The term has been adopted for Portuguese by Baptista 2005b pp.?157?162 to name apparently facultative human complements introduced by compound preposition para com ÅetowardsÅf lit:Åefor withÅf in support verb constructions e.g O gesto do Pedro para com o Joao foi de uma grande delicadeza = O gesto do Pedro foi de uma grande delicadeza para com o Joao ÅePeterÅfs gesture towards John was of great delicacy = PeterÅfs gesture was of great delicacy towards JohnÅf
Nevertheless in the same work Baptista 2005b p.?165 when referring to the distinction between symmetrical and reciprocal constructions calls the type of complement here addressed pronominal copy
While other authors namely Guillet and Leclere 1992 Laporte 2004 and Baptista 2005a,b may have used the term echo complement to describe different linguistic phenomena and apparently have not used it for the specific type of complement here addressed the term could fit the first definition provided by Guillet and Leclere 1981 pp.?116?117
Though briefly noted the term was then used to designate a type of prepositional complement that Ågrenders more ÅgpreciseÅh while recovering at least partially the meaning of the utteranceÅh our translation
More recently Baptista 2005a the term was used for anaphoric expressions in reciprocal constructions analysable as the result of the reduction of two coordinated sentences with same predicate but with two constituents in symmetrical position
Peter talked with John and John talked with Peter Å® Peter and John talked with each other


No Budget No Pay Act of 2013

In the United States the No Budget No Pay Act of 2013 is a law that was passed during the 113th United States Congress in potential violation of the 27th Amendment The Act temporarily suspended the United States debt ceiling from February 4 2013 until May 18 2013 It also placed temporary restrictions on Congressional salaries
Background
An earlier version of the No Budget No Pay Act unrelated to the debt ceiling was originally introduced in early 2012 by Jim Cooper a Democratic congressman from Tennessee It stipulated that congressmen in the United States Congress would not get paid unless they passed a budget by October 1 2012
The bill received limited bipartisan support However some members of Congress on both sides of the aisle opposed the bill stating it would have likely violated the 27th Amendment to the United States Constitution which states No law varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives shall take effect until an election of Representatives shall have intervened
It was considered dead until mid-January 2013 when Republican lawmakers came up with the idea of combining sections of this bill with a debt ceiling increase Despite showing no desire to pass a budget Democratic lawmakers accepted the compromise
Provisions/Elements of the bill
This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service a public domain source
This summary was written by the bill's sponsor Rep Dave Camp
The Senate passed the FY2014 budget on March 23 2013?23 days before the deadline set by the No Budget No Pay Act of 2013 This was the first Senate budget passage since a FY2010 budget passed on April 29 2009 No Senate budget was passed for FY2011 FY2012 or FY2013
Congressional Budget Office report
H.R 325 would temporarily suspend the debt limit by the Treasury until May 18 2013 On the following day the current debt limit of $16.394 trillion would be raised by the amount of borrowing above that level during the period in which the limitation was suspended
The Act also provided an incentive for action on a concurrent resolution on the budget If a version of such a resolution has not been passed by a House of the Congress by April 15 2013 the salaries of Members of that chamber would be put in an escrow account The escrow account for a given House would remain in place until a concurrent resolution on the budget was passed for fiscal year 2014 by that chamber or until the last day of the 113th Congress whichever was earlier
Procedural history
House
The Act was introduced into the House of Representatives by Rep Dave Camp R-MI on January 21 2013 The bill was referred to the Committee on House Administration and the House Committee on Ways and Means The House voted to pass the bill on January 23 2013 by 285-144 in Roll Call Vote #30
Senate
The Act was received in the Senate on January 24 2013 It passed the Senate on January 31 2013 by a vote of 64-34 in Recorded Vote 11
Presidential signature
President Barack Obama signed the Act into law on February 4 2013


Thionville?Trier railway

The Thionville?Trier railway also called the Obermoselstrecke connects Thionville in the French region of Lorraine with Trier in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate It also passes through the westernmost part of the Saarland along the Moselle for a few kilometres
History
The line was opened for traffic from Metz on 15 May 1878 It connected in Trier with the Saar Railway which was connected to Luxembourg by the Trier West Railway and the Luxembourg?Wasserbillig line completed in 1861 and to the line from Cologne completed in 1871 The line ended in Ehrang and trains continued over the Trier West route from Konz because Trier-West station was still TrierÅfs main station A year later with the completion of the line to Koblenz Trier Central Station Hauptbahnhof main station was opened at its current location The two stations that are in the Saarland Nennig and Perl were built in 1927 or 1929
The railway line was part of the so-called Cannons Railway Kanonenbahn between Berlin and Metz
The line between Wellen and Perl was completely closed due to construction from 14 June 2009 to 16 August 2010 A rail replacement bus service was established As maintaining operations over the two-track infrastructure would have cost ?6 million more than the nearly ?30 million spent on the renovation work on the Nittel Tunnel the track was closed despite repeated protests by the transport ministries of Rhineland-Palatinate and the Saarland as well as the Lothringischen Interregionalen Parlamentarierrat Lotharingia Interregional Parliamentary Council IPR
Route
The line is continuously double-track except for the section through the Karthaus-Saar bridge and the Nittel Tunnel and electrified It branches from the Metz?Luxembourg line in Thionville and runs largely along the Moselle It therefore has only a very small gradient It has no large bridges Two thirds of the line is now in Germany and the French operating company TER Lorraine is responsible for one-third of it The Regionalbahn service on the German side operates as line RB 82 The stations in the two German states belong to different regional transport networks In the Trier area up to the border with the Saarland they belong to the Verkehrsverbund Region Trier Transport Association of the Trier region and the three stations in the Saarland belong to the Saarlandischer Verkehrsverbund Saarland Transport Association
Operations
Since the change to the summer 2008 timetable after a gap of over 14 years passenger trains run again over the border but only at weekends at two-hour intervals Previously the approximately one-kilometre-long section between the two stations at the border Perl in the Saarland and Apach in Lorraine was not served Both stations were terminal stations for all passenger services in their country
As part of Rhineland-Palatinate integrated timetable of 2015 Rheinland-Pfalz-Takt 2015 all Regionalbahn services will be extended from the timetable change in December 2014 from Perl to Thionville
Rolling stock
After the end of steam traction in 1974 the line was largely used by locomotives of class 181 hauling passengers and freight trains In freight transport these were followed by Trier V160 locomotives reclassified as class 216 in the 1970s then Class 215 locomotives from the 1980s In passenger services Uerdingen railbuses were also used on the German side and the French used class X 4300 diesel multiple units of the SNCF Class 670 railcars were briefly used in 1996 but did not prove themselves in service
Only since the turn of the millennium has rolling stock use changed fundamentally Class 425 and 426 electric multiple units are used for passenger services These should have been replaced by Bombardier Talent 2 class 442 EMUs in 2010 However since they were not approved to operate by the Federal Railway Authority Eisenbahn-Bundesamt class 143 locomotives were used with older double-decker carriages French X 73900 Alstom Coradia diesel multiple units are used on weekends between Trier and Metz
In 2011 freight operations were largely in the hands of multi-system locomotives such as the German class 185 Bombardier TRAXX and the French BB 37000


Brazil?Indonesia relations

Brazil?Indonesia relations refers to the bilateral relations of the Federative Republic of Brazil and the Republic of Indonesia Both are large tropical country endowed with rich natural resources Brazil and Indonesia possess the largest tropical rain forest of the world that contains the world's richest biodiversity which gave them a vital role in global environment issues such as ensuring tropical forests protection Both countries leading the list of Megadiverse countries with Indonesia second only to Brazil
Brazil expects to expand its cooperation with Indonesia as there is still enormous room for growth in many areas including agriculture and high-technology industry Both countries are members of World Trade Organization WTO Forum of East Asia-Latin America Cooperation and the G20 major economies By first quarter of 21st-century both nations are expected to emerge as the rising global power
History
Diplomatic relations has been established since 1953 Indonesia has an embassy in Brasilia and Brazil has an embassy in Jakarta Although the bilateral relations was rather strained during Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975 until East Timor independence in 1999 since Brazil shares a solidarity and close sentiments for East Timor as common former Portuguese colonies and Portuguese-speaking countries
State visits
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva visited Indonesia on 12 July 2008 This was his first visit to Indonesia and the second visit of Brazilian President to Indonesia since President Fernando Henrique Cardoso visits on January 2001 Subsequently Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono paid a visit to Brazil on 18 November 2008 on his way to attend APEC Summit in Lima Peru President Yudhoyono visited Brazil for the second time in 18 November 2009 during this visit the president of both nations signed strategic partnership agreement between Brazil and Indonesia Previously on 14?16 October 2009 the first meeting of Brazil-Indonesia Joint Commission was conducted to discuss the action plan on strategic partnership
Economy and trade
Currently Brazil is Indonesia's main trade partner in South America region Bilateral trade rose by 185.09 percent to $3.25 billion in 2010 from $1.14 billion in 2006 and expected to reach beyond $4 billion by 2012 Indonesia mainly exports yarn natural rubber crude palm oil fixed vegetable fats and oil cocoa paper electronics and automotive spare parts and imports soybean oil sugar cane cotton and iron from Brazil Brazil was interested not only in increasing exports and investing in Indonesia but also to increase imports such as fertilizers textiles and palm oil and further Indonesian investment including in infrastructure projects


Surface chemistry of paper

The surface chemistry of paper is responsible for many important paper properties such as gloss waterproofing and printability There are many components that are used in the paper-making process The interactions between these components are responsible for creating the properties of the paper The types and quantities of ingredients used can be adjusted to reach the desired properties In order to understand why paper has certain properties one must first understand the chemistry of the paper
Paper Components and Their Interactions
Pigment and Dispersion Medium
Coating components are subject to particle-particle particle-solvent and particle-polymer interactions Van der Waals forces electrostatic repulsions and steric stabilization are the reasons for these interactions It is important to point out the characteristics of adhesion and cohesion between the components that form the base coating structure Calcium carbonate and kaolin are commonly used pigments in paper production Pigments support a structure of fine porosity and form a light scattering surface The surface charge of the pigment plays an important role in dispersion consistency The surface charge of calcium carbonate is negative and not dependent on pH however it can decompose under acidic conditions Kaolin has negatively charged faces while the charge of its laterals depend on pH being positive in acidic conditions and negative in basic conditions with an isoelectric point at 7.5 The equation for determining the isoelectric point is as follows
where formula_2 is the interfacial tension between the solid and the liquid formula_3 is the interfacial tension between the liquid and the vapor and formula_4 is the interfacial tension between the solid and the vapor
An ideal oleophilic surface would have a contact angle of 0Åã with oil therefore allowing the ink to transfer to the paper and be absorbed The hydrocarbon plasma coating provides an oleophilic surface to the paper by lowering the contact angle of the paper with the oil in the ink
The hydrocarbon plasma coating increases the non-polar interactions while decreasing polar interactions which allow paper to absorb ink while preventing dampening water absorption
Applications
Printing quality is highly influenced by the various treatments and methods used in creating paper and enhancing the paper surface Consumers are most concerned with the paper-ink interactions which vary for certain types of paper due to different chemical properties of the surface Inkjet paper is the most commercially used type of paper Filter paper is another key type of paper whose surface chemistry affects its various forms and uses
Inkjet Printing Paper
Co-styrene-maleic anhydride and co-styrene acrylate are common binders associated with a cationic starch pigment in Inkjet printing paper Table 1 shows their surface tension under given conditions
There have been several studies that have focused on how the paper printing quality is dependent on the concentration of these binders and ink pigment Data from the experiments are congruent and stated in Table 2 as the corrected contact angle of water the corrected contact angle of black ink and the total surface energy
The contact angle measurement has proven to be a very useful tool to evaluate the influence of the sizing formulation on the printing properties Surface free energy has also shown to be very valuable in explaining the differences in sample behavior
Filter Paper
Various composite coatings were analyzed on filter paper in an experiment done by Wang et al The ability to separate homogenous liquid solutions based on varying surface tensions has great practical use Creating superhydrophobic and superoleophilic filter paper was achieved by treating the surface of commercially available filter paper with hydrophobic silica nanoparticles and polystyrene solution in toluene Oil and water were successfully separated through the use of the filter paper created with an efficiency greater than 96% In a homogenous solution the filter paper was also successful in separating the liquids through differentiating for surface tensions Although with a lower efficiency aqueous ethanol was also extraced from the solution when tested on the filter paper


Seguenzia costulifera

Seguenzia costulifera is a species of extremely small deep water sea snail a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Seguenziidae
Description
Original description by M Schepman The height of the yellowish white shell attains 5?mm The rather small shell has a conoidal shape with a high spire and convex base It is scalar and rimate It contains about 7 whorls of which the upper one forms the smooth bulbous nucleus followed by 2 whorls which have a strong median keel and traces of a third one below the suture These lirations become more conspicuous on the lower whorls which have the median keel another one just below the suture and in some parts traces of a third one running entirely or partly in the deep suture Moreover the whole shell is covered with microscopic close-set spiral threads This sculpture is crossed by conspicuous riblets fainter on the upper whorls very strong on the lower ones and by very fine growth-striae The riblets are not close-set and form conspicuous spines below the suture of the lower whorls When they cross the upper spiral they run obliquely from behind and are curved in the lower part of the space between the upper and median keel being concave below Below this median keel they are convex On the body whorl runs a third keel which is crenulated by the ribs This is also the case with the median keel though not so strong;.aA some distance from the third keel a fourth one makes its appearance this is a little fainter and less crenulate the riblets between it and the third keel being also weaker The interspaces of the keels described above are conspicuously concave From the fourth keel until the centre run 5 spirals of which the distal one at a considerable distance from the 4th keel The innermost borders the umbilicus These spirals are narrow cord-like with large interspaces crossed by riblets in very various direction The umbilicus is rather large but nearly closed by the columellar margin leaving only a fissure The aperture is incomplete a rather broad but not deep fissure at the upper part rounded and turned up behind The shape of the aperture is subquadrangular irregular by the terminations of the keels The columellar margin is expanded towards the left formed by a deep rounded sinus above and another narrower one below with a strong tooth between them This tooth is strongly compressed as if formed by pinching the columellar margin
Distribution
This marine species occurs off Sulawesi Indonesia

Early years
Scipione Cobelluzzi was born in Viterbo into a well-off family according to the Jesuit Angelo Galluzzi who gave his funeral oration his father a pharmacist became conservatore magistrate of Viterbo on the same day that Scipione was born He was educated in Rome by the Jesuits in the Collegio Nardini and studied Greek privately with Niccolo Alemanni He also studied at the Archgymnasium of Rome He graduated in civil and canon law from the Sapienza University of Rome There were other cardinals in his family including Girolamo Bernerio Francesco Cennini de Salamandri and Desiderio Scaglia
He worked as a prefect for Alessandro Gloriero president of the Annona and then as secretary to Cardinal Girolamo Bernerio In 1609 he served as the Secretary of Briefs He also taught law at the university
Although his publications have not survived he had the reputation of being well educated erudite and an eloquent speaker He became domestic secretary to Pope Paul V who appointed him in 1611 to a position in the Papal Curia and in 1615 custodian of the Archive of Castel Sant'Angelo On 17 October 1616 he was named Cardinal-Priest of Santa Susanna and he was then appointed Cardinal Librarian on 17 February 1618 In this last post in 1622 he directed Leo Allatius who had made the journey to Heidelberg for the transfer in the acquisition of the Palatine Library While Cardinal his secretary was Vincenzo Gramigna Cobelluzzi was also Cardinal Archivist for the Vatican Secret Archives from 1618 to 1626 the word Secret is better understood to mean private than secret in this context The Vatican library also has a record of the astrological prediction by Gioanni Bartolini for 1618 given to him when he was Cardinal-Priest of Santa Susanna
After the death of Paul V on 28 January 1621 perhaps in gratitude to the former pope Cobelluzzi supported the candidacy of Scipione Borghese at the papal conclave which elected Pope Gregory XV later they were not on good terms He was a member of the Inquisition and one of the cardinals who questioned Galileo after he came to Rome and also of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith created on 6 January 1622 to which he gave 100 scudi a year for ransoming prisoners of the Turks He was also one of the cardinals on the commission created to adjudicate the proposed marriage between the Prince of Wales the future Charles I of England and the Infanta Maria Anna of Spain in 1623 the commission recommended to the Pope that the marriage be permitted

Untererthal

Untererthal is a ward of the Bavarian town of Hammelburg in the Lower Franconian district of Bad Kissingen The German Army's Infantry School Infanterieschule is located in neighboring Hammelburg
Geography
Untererthal is located to the north of Hammelburg
Bundesstrase 27 or B 27 runs through Untererthal heading south towards Hammelburg and north towards Bad Bruckenau The next locality on this road is Neuwirtshaus The St 2291 exits Untererthal on the eastern side towards Thulba and after a roundabout connecting St 2291 with Bundesautobahn 7 towards Oberthulba
History
Burial mounds near Buchelberg indicate an early settlement of the Untererthal region The first known written mention of the town was on a deed dated January 7 777 under the name Harital Untererthal was one of the gifts that Charlemagne gave to the Fulda Monastery
The history of the town is closely intertwined with the Erthal family line The Erthal family used to inhabit the castle Erthal that is no longer maintained and had a residence on the current Judenhof
The Jewish community of the town emerged between the 16th and 17th centuries The first known documentary evidence of this dates from the year 1524 The Jewish population of Untererthal stood under the protection of the lords of Erthal and inherited the entire castle square when the family seat was destroyed in 1796 While the Jewish dead were buried in the Jewish cemetery of Pfaffenhausen the first mention of the local synagogue was in the year 1737 However the synagogue was demolished because it was built illegally In 1805 a prayer room was built in the Jewish quarter and was renovated in 1842
Today's Bundesstrase 27 was crucial for the history of the town as it was an important north-south military route over which not only princes and merchants traveled to the area in order to trade but also armies traveled during the Thirty Years War Napoleonic Wars and Austro-Prussian War
Between 1926 and 1929 the church which was built during the Romantic Period was replaced through the construction of the Church of St Martin
As part of the infamous Kristallnacht the facilities of the synagogue were destroyed and rituals and services were stopped however the building had been left standing until 1945 A search by the district police of the Jewish households for hoarded food that took place on November 28 and 29 1938 was inconclusive In 1942 Jews from Untererthal were dorported to the Izbica Ghetto on April 22 and to the Concentration Camp in Theresienstadt in September
During World War II the neighboring town Hammelburg was the site of the POW Camps OFLAG XIII-B and Stalag XIII-C as well as the attempted rescue of POW's from these camps by Task Force Baum in 1945 The American television sitcom Hogan's Heroes which ran on CBS from 1965 to 1971 featured a fictional Stalag 13 said to be near Hammelburg possibly in or near Untererthal
Untererthal become a quarter of Hammelburg on January 1 1972 after the Free State of Bavaria enacted municipal reforms
Historic Buildings
Church of St Martin
It is uncertain as to whether there was already a church in Untererthal in the year 800 because the necessary evidence is lacking However the patrongage of the church supposes the existence of a church at that time
The first church in Untererthal was built at the end of the 11th Century by the Erthal family Under Dietrich Georg von Erthal extensive rebuilding measures including a choir nave and tower were undertaken in 1590
The church proved to be too small for the growing number of Christians and the construction of the Church of St Martin began in 1926 The inauguration of the Church of St Martin took place on May 5 1929 Certain parts of the original church built in the Romanesque style still exist to this day and are part of the Church of St Martin
Landgasthof zum Goldenen Kreuz
Centuries ago the then lords of Erthal claimed certain rights under the Schankrecht which were laws during the late medieval period covering commercial rights to host guests in a restaurant/tavern In exercising these rights the lords of Erthal built a tavern in Untererthal but it was not until 1548 that the first innkeeper Hans Murk was mentioned Over the centuries many other innkeepers followed in his footsteps
In 1733 Johann Bau tore down the old building and constructed a larger inn in the baroque style The arches at the entrance keystones window frames and other structural aspects all date to this period of construction and are still integral to the inn However the antique door is attributed to an unknown later date It was at this time in 1737 that it was first mentioned that the inn had a golden cross guldenes Kreuz in its decorative shield thereby giving rise to the name Landgasthof zum Goldenen Kreuz
Johann Josef Schafer acquired the inn through marriage in 1895 and extended what is today the rear wing of the building In 1910 renovations and extensions were carried out and along with the construction carried out in 1733 these form the current structure of the Landgasthof zum Goldenen Kreuz Due to the history of the inn and its architecture it is currently protected by a preservation order

Greta Pratt

Greta Pratt is an American photographer whose primary interests are American identity history and myth She is the author of two books of photographs Using History Steidl 2005 and In Search of the Corn Queen Smithsonian American Art Museum 1994 PrattÅfs work is represented in major public and private collections including the Smithsonian American Art Museum Smithsonian Institution The Museum of Fine Arts Houston Museum of Contemporary Photography Portland Oregon Art Museum and Minneapolis Institute of Art Pratt was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and served as photography bureau chief of Reuters International in New York City Her photographs have been featured in Art in America The New York Times Magazine and The New Yorker
Career
Pratt has made a practice of documenting staged American history Her series Nineteen Lincolns celebrates one of the most iconic elements of the bedrock of American history and puts a quirky modern twist on it Nineteen Lincolns has been on view in solo and group shows across the country since 2007
Her book Using History is an accurate depiction of her photographic universe which is the intersection where American past meets American present Pratt often uses clever juxtapositions of photos to tell her tale of how Americans incorporate their country's past to explain their attitudes to the present
Author Howard Zinn People's History of the United States says of Pratt's Using History Greta Pratt's extraordinary photographs give us glimpses of people and places that stimulate us to think about our history not only of the great American West but of the nation itself Her point of view is delightfully antic and provocative We want not only to enjoy the moment of our viewing but also to study and ponder each photograph challenged to find its larger meaning
Pratt's work has a clear connection with that of Martin Parr both using hyper-saturated color to slyly capture the peculiarities of how everyday people represent themselves and their roots
Education
Pratt received her BFA in photography from the University of Minnesota and her MFA in from the State University of New York at New Paltz
Quotes about Pratt's work
ÅgÅcEveryone is trying to connect to the past but the past is always fiction How history is told reveals much more about the people and time period that are telling it than about history itself.Åh
ÅgThis book is a collection of photographs about history perceived about how we look at ourselves and others about how we recreate and reaffirm the American experience about how we continue to live with to rationalize and to atone for the lingering spirit of placeÅc.PrattÅfs photographs help create an understanding of a special form of vernacular storytelling of acting out and dressing up the past History as we remember it emerges from her photographs Perhaps it could more correctly be labeled history as we want it to be remembered or even better as we re-create and relive it As the American novelist Willa Cather reminds us ÅgMemory is better than reality.Åh
ÅgWhat Pratt catches here is not merely anachronism or ironyÅcWhat you see here is the attempt by ordinary people ? nonhistorians that is ? to capture history in a form that makes it locally communally tangible ? history as shared terrainÅcThere is an idea in most of these faces though The idea is continuity with forebears with first principles with a larger conception of the time horizon than everyday life usually affords.Åh

Ceiba chodatii

The floss silk tree Ceiba chodatii is a species of deciduous tree native to the tropical and subtropical forests of South America It has a bottle-shaped swollen trunk in which water is stored for the dry season and is known locally as palo borracho
Description
Ceiba chodatii is a medium sized deciduous tree with a tall stout bare trunk It grows to about tall has a number of thick branches at the top of the swollen trunk and has a rounded crown The bark is smooth with vertical ridges and horizontal wrinkles It contains chlorophyll and is green when young and able to photosynthesize but turns grey with age It is covered with thick woody conical spines The alternate leaves are palmate with five lobes and serrated edges The flowers are large solitary and creamy white with a few purple flecks They are up to long with yellow-green calyces and funnel-shaped corollas with five fleshy hairy petals joined at the base The fruit is a large oblong green capsule When ripe it splits open to reveal black seeds surrounded by a mass of white fibres resembling cotton
Distribution and habitat
Ceiba chodatii is native to the forests of Bolivia the Chaco region of Paraguay and the Piedmont Mountains of western Argentina where it is found in seasonally dry woodlands It flowers between February and May
Ecology
The flowers open at dusk and are probably pollinated by sphingid moths Other members of the genus are pollinated by bats but this seems unlikely for Ceiba chodatii as the flowers produce little nectar Humming birds also visit the flowers but do not touch the anthers or stigma Self-pollination does not occur in this species because of a late-acting form of self-incompatibility
The bottle-shaped trunk is swollen with water being retained by the tree for use in the dry season The indigenous people of the Chaco make use of this water for their cattle and the timber is used to make canoes and articles for daily use Fibres from the trunk are woven into ropes and extracts from the bark are used for tanning and as a dye
The dry chaco where this tree is found has dense spiny woodlands consisting of low trees and an understorey of Aspidosperma Astronium Schinopsis Ceiba and Bulnesia The ground is clad in thorny plants some with microphylls and others with no leaves and cacti such as Cereus and Stetsonia Some plants such as Jacaratia accumulate water in tubercles

CarPlay

CarPlay previously announced as iOS in the Car is a standard developed by Apple Inc to allow devices running the iOS operating system to function with built-in display units of automobile dashboards CarPlay is available for all iPhones that use the Lightning connector and operate iOS 7.1 or later While unveiled as iOS in the Car during the opening keynote of the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference WWDC on June 10 2013 it was later formally renamed CarPlay on launching to the public on March 3 2014 at the Geneva Motor Show
Functionality
The aim of CarPlay is to provide direct access to iOS device functionality control and usage directly as a virtual machine on top of the manufacturers native in-car control systems which predominately run on the BlackBerry QNX based OS which is the longtime major market share holder in this field The initial timescale for release is from 2014 on some car models by selected manufacturers
Integration is aimed for several functions that iOS devices currently incorporate these include
Manufacturers and brands
Vehicle
At the 2013 WWDC keynote Apple's senior vice president SVP of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue announced some of the many manufacturers that are planning to include the functionality from 2014 onwards Others like BMW initially announced they were not going to include the functionality but later back-pedaled changing their position to possibly introducing the standard to their vehicles
At the launch at the Geneva Motor Show Apple confirmed that Ferrari Mercedes-Benz and Volvo would be among the first car manufacturers to bring CarPlay compatible models to market though Mercedes-Benz and Volvo later delayed rollout to 2015 On July 1 Apple quietly added Fiat Chrysler and Mazda to their CarPlay web page
A Ferrari FF was the first car to delivered with a fully functioning version of CarPlay on September 8 2014
So far the list of vehicle manufacturers and brands who have shown interest in CarPlay and/or Siri Eyes Free includes
Infotainment
In April 2014 it was announced that Pioneer Corporation would provide a firmware upgrade to bring CarPlay to some existing products and Alpine Electronics would launch a new compatible aftermarket device
So far the list of infotainment manufacturers and brands who have shown interest in CarPlay and/or Siri Eyes Free includes
History
Apple first announced the introduction of a new in-vehicle extended iOS functionality as iOS in the Car at their WWDC on June 10 2013 although during development its codename was Stark iOS 7.1 beta 1 and 2 include some settings about what was then iOS in the Car hinting it would soon get released According to January 2014 reports iOS in the Car had been delayed by organizational issues at Apple as Apple executives didn't quite know what to do with the software and the development group had to lobby hard for stage time at the 2013 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference WWDC
On March 3 2014 Apple announced via a press release at the start of the Geneva Motor Show and updated pages on their website that the service is to have a change of name to CarPlay as well as announcing some further manufacturers that will make integrations to their newer vehicles and that CarPlay will work with all Lightning-enabled iPhones currently the 5 5C 5S 6 / 6 Plus


Roger Rabbit short films

The Roger Rabbit shorts are a series of animated short films produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation from 1989 to 1993 The anthology features Roger Rabbit the animated protagonist from Who Framed Roger Rabbit being enlisted the task of caring for Baby Herman while his mother is absent resulting in a plot defined by slapstick humor and visual gags Each short concludes with a sequence involving live action and animation where the characters interact with human beings akin to the 1988 film
Charles Fleischer Kathleen Turner Lou Hirsch and April Winchell returned to reprise their voice roles from the film alongside producers Steven Spielberg Kathleen Kennedy Frank Marshall and Don Hahn Marshall also directed the live-action segments in the first two shorts while Industrial Light & Magic was responsible for the live-action visual effects Produced in association with Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment the three shorts Tummy Trouble Roller Coaster Rabbit and Trail Mix-Up were originally attached to the theatrical releases of several Disney and Amblin films A fourth short Hare in My Soup was cancelled during pre-production
Tummy Trouble
Plot
Roger is placed in charge of watching Baby Herman when his mother needs to step out for an hour as soon as she leaves Herman breaks into a heavy crying fit which Roger doesn't seem to be able to break until he pulls out Herman's favorite rattle which immediately garners Herman's attention After a brief second of shaking it Herman swallows the rattle prompting Roger to rush the baby to the emergency room Roger is overcome with guilt when he visits but quickly realizes Herman wants to drink from a milk bottle in the room after Roger burps Herman he hiccups the rattle but in Roger's joyous celebration he accidentally swallows it causing Baby Herman to become upset he lost his toy Roger begins to dance his hips rattling with the toy and giving Baby Herman some amusement but a doctor bursts in and mistakes Roger for Baby Herman and preps him for emergency surgery
While he's gone Herman spies Jessica Rabbit pushing a cart of milk bottles and gives chase eventually following a runaway milk bottle into the emergency room where Roger is strapped to the table while the surgeons had disappeared for a lunch break Herman mistakes a large surgical laser for a bottle and climbs up onto it nearly dissecting Roger in the process The laser detaches itself from the ceiling and flings a table of scalpels and hypodermic needles at Roger who avoids them but is electrocuted in the process The laser flies around the room and lodges itself under Roger's stretcher and he and Herman both eject from the emergency room causing Roger to gag up the rattle and Baby Herman to again swallow it before crashing into a wheelchair they then fly down the hall and into an open elevator shaft due to wet floors causing the wheelchair they landed on to skid out of control Baby Herman's diaper parachutes him safely to a floor while Roger ends up getting crushed by an elevator while trying to catch Herman Eventually they end up in a room with piles of gas pumps which are ignited and the pair are launched miles into the air As they fall Herman coughs up the rattle and Roger swallows it again As they crash back into the hospital Roger crashes through several floors before landing smack down on the receptionist floor in the hospital As he recovers Baby Herman lands on Roger causing him to cough up the rattle again finally ending their adventure But Roger's celebration is short lived when he sees the bill for their rampant destruction and passes out Herman then crawls over to the rattle and as the screen fades to black there is a gulping sound as he again swallows the rattle
During the end credits however Herman angrily threatens trouble if he has to swallow the rattle again
Unlike the next two cartoons this short was completed
Production
Tummy Trouble was produced over the course of nine months by a staff of 70 Disney animators It was the first animated short Disney had produced in 25 years to accompany a feature film since Goofy's Freeway Trouble in 1965
The short was released with Walt Disney Pictures Honey I Shrunk the Kids theatrically and on that film's initial video release An adaptation of this short appeared in the graphic novel
Roller Coaster Rabbit
Plot
Roger Rabbit Baby Herman and Mrs Herman are at the local county fair Baby Herman loses his red balloon and Roger goes to get him a new one Before he returns however Baby Herman sees another red balloon at a dart game and goes to try to get it When Roger comes back to give Baby his balloon he finds that he is gone and the chase begins Firstly Baby Herman finds himself following the balloon into a field homed to a grazing bull Roger soon follows the youngster and Roger falls in bull dung Baby Herman walks through directly underneath the bull he notices a round balloon-like object and grasps it unknown to him that it was in fact the bull's scrotum The grazing creature snaps Roger picks up Baby Herman but just happens to be looking the bull in the eyes The animal hurls Roger and baby into the air sending him flying out of the field and the two land crashing into a roller coaster carriage which is traveling slowly up
The next stage of this short the carriage continues to climb a tall hill in the track The two reach the top of the drop which is exaggerated to reach beyond the clouds and into space Roger looks down and sees the world Moments later the carriage drops down thousands of meters The speed of the drop is maintained throughout the remainder of the chase After a few twist and turns in the track a shot of Jessica Rabbit appears where she is tied down to the tracks unable to move She calls out to be saved before Roger and Baby Herman's carriage crushes her As the cart draws near it topples over and fortunately bounces over Jessica avoiding her completely The camera moves along and beside her appears Droopy for a quick one-liner The story then continues Roger grasping onto Baby Herman tumbling and losing their carriage leaving Roger sliding along the tracks with his feet gradually gaining friction causing his feet to catch fire The tracks run into a dark tunnel and then stumbles across a wrong way sign Finally Herman and Roger crash through the sign and into a real-life filming studio A direct reference to the reality/cartoon crossover in the feature film
Production
Roller Coaster Rabbit along with Trail Mix-Up was produced at the satellite studio located at Disney-MGM Studios in Lake Buena Vista Florida Rob Minkoff returned to direct the second short in the series
Spielberg wanted the short to appear with Arachnophobia Hollywood Pictures's first feature and a co-production between Disney and Amblin However CEO Michael Eisner opted to release the short with the US theatrical release of Touchstone Pictures Dick Tracy in hopes that the short would increase awareness to the film Spielberg who controlled a 50% ownership stake in the character decided to cancel Hare in My Soup the third short that had entered production
Trail Mix-Up
Plot
The short features Roger Rabbit Baby Herman and Mrs Herman at the park setting up camp Mrs Herman plans to go hunting and leaves Roger in charge of watching Baby Herman Trouble begins when Baby wanders off in the dangers of the forest and Roger has to go and save him leading to multiple calamities such as Roger panicking at the sight of a bug and spraying so much insecticide named Mink-Off that many trees die Later Baby Herman follows a bee up to a beehive and Roger tries to save him The beehive falls on Roger's head causing him to get stung multiple times The bees proceed to chase him so Roger runs into a lake where he panics at the sight of a shark's dorsal fin which is actually controlled by Droopy
Later Baby Herman follows a beaver mistaking him for a dog and Roger chases after them Baby Herman follows the beaver up a pile of logs and Roger follows only to have the log that Baby and the beaver are on taken to the sawmill This ends up with Roger being shredded by a sawmill and the result is 13 tiny Rogers which then join again into a regular-sized Roger who follows Baby Herman still following the beaver onto a conveyor belt with logs It ends up with the logs being thrown down a log flume eventually landing in a river The log Roger Baby and the beaver are on crashes into a bear who ends up on the log Then the four fall off a waterfall Roger's head gets stuck in a twig sticking out of the waterfall and he catches Baby Herman holding on to the beaver and the bear grabs onto Roger's legs The combined weight rebounds sending all four flying landing on a large boulder
The boulder proceeds to roll down a hill knocking over a tree trunk with the same sound effects as a bowling pin and then flying off a cliff Eventually Roger the bear the log the beaver the boulder and Baby Herman all land on top of Old Predictable Geyser in that order Then Old Predictable Geyser erupts sending Roger the bear the log the beaver the boulder and Baby Herman flying out of the studio above Hollywood before landing on Mount Rushmore destroying it Everyone is battered and beaten and Baby Herman yells at Roger for destroying Mount Rushmore Roger sticks a flag made of his pants in the ground and salutes but then the Earth deflates
Production
Trail Mix-Up was directed by Barry Cook instead of Rob Minkoff who remained as a co-executive producer Trail Mix-Up was the third and last Roger Rabbit short and was again produced by Disney's Florida studio Unlike the two previous shorts the animation and composting was done digital in the studio's CAPS system
The short was released theatrically with Disney/Amblin's A Far Off Place on March 12 1993
Home media
In 1995 a VHS tape of the three shorts was released under the title It's Roger Rabbit bundled with Who Framed Roger Rabbit A nearly identical video was released by itself in 1996 under the title Disney and Steven Spielberg present The Best of Roger Rabbit The three shorts are also included in the 2003 special edition Vista Series DVD of Who Framed Roger Rabbit On March 12 2013 Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment reissued all three shorts -in HD but without studio logos- as part of the 25th anniversary Blu-ray release of Who Framed Roger Rabbit


Wise?Anderson Protocol

The Wise?Anderson Protocol WAP or Stanford Protocol deprecated is a treatment protocol for pelvic pain conditions in men and women developed at Stanford University by urologists psychologists and physical therapists A physician does the medical evaluation and treats the medical issues the physical therapist teaches the patients self-administered trigger point release and administers the physical therapy part of the protocol and a psychologist treats the psychological and behavioral aspects of the relaxation protocol
History
The protocol originated between 1995 and 2003 through a collaboration between psychologist David Wise PhD and Dr Rodney Anderson at Stanford University School of Medicine Wise worked as a Visiting Research Scholar at the Stanford University Medical Center where he treated patients with pelvic pain Anderson was considered an international expert in the field of pelvic pain and worked as a professor at Stanford School of Medicine as a practising urologist and as head of the pelvic pain clinic for many years Anderson was closely involved in research on pelvic pain with the National Institutes of Health Together they devised the method now called the Wise?Anderson Protocol It was initially called the Stanford Protocol but became the Wise?Anderson Protocol when the clinic moved deliberately outside of a hospital setting Wise who himself suffered chronic pelvic pain for over twenty years cured himself using the protocol
In 2003 Wise began an immersion treatment program in Sonoma County California after he left Stanford The WAP is a group process in conjunction with individual physical therapy instruction in self-treatment Wise states that we have found that this intensive immersion group format is the most effective way to train patients in our protocol enabling them to treat their condition without having to rely on professional help once they leave the clinic At the end of our clinics without any intention on our part the atmosphere is almost always one of a group of good friends
Treatment
Pelvic pain syndromes such as Category III CP/CPPS may have no initial trigger other than anxiety often with an element of OCD panic disorder or other anxiety-spectrum problem This is theorized to leave the pelvic area in a sensitized condition resulting in a loop of muscle tension and heightened neurological feedback neural pain wind-up
The WAP focusses on stretches to release overtensed muscles in the pelvic or anal area commonly referred to as trigger points including digital prostate massage physical therapy to the area and progressive relaxation therapy to reduce causative stress
The WAP clinic is a combination of
Randomised trials of myofascial therapy have shown it to be effective at alleviating symptoms


Ball propellant

Ball propellant is a form of nitrocellulose used in small arms cartridges It has been trademarked as Ball Powder by Olin Corporation and marketed as spherical powder by Hodgdon Powder Company Ball propellant can be manufactured more rapidly with greater safety and lesser expense than extruded propellants Ball propellant was first used to load military small arms cartridges during World War II and has been manufactured for sale to handloading civilians since 1960
History
The United States military replaced gunpowder during the first decade of the 20th century with smokeless powders formulated from nitrocellulose colloided with ether and alcohol Large quantities were manufactured for World War I and significant amounts remained unused after the war Nitrocellulose deteriorates in storage but military quantities of old smokeless propellant were sometimes reworked into new lots of propellants
Through the 1920s Dr Fred Olsen worked at Picatinny Arsenal experimenting with ways to salvage tons of cannon powder manufactured for World War I Dr Olsen was employed by Western Cartridge Company in 1929 and developed a process for manufacturing ball propellant by 1933 Reworked powder was dissolved in ethyl acetate containing small quantities of desired stabilizers and other additives The resultant syrup combined with water and surfactants is heated and agitated in a pressurized container until the syrup forms an emulsion of small spherical globules of the desired size Ethyl acetate distills off as pressure is slowly reduced to leave small spheres of nitrocellulose and additives The spheres can be subsequently modified by adding nitroglycerin to increase energy flattening between rollers to a uniform minimum dimension coating with deterrents to retard ignition and/or glazing with graphite to improve flow characteristics during blending
This manufacturing process also worked with newly manufactured nitrocellulose and manufacturing time was reduced from approximately two weeks for extruded propellants to 40 hours for ball propellants Rate of burning is controlled by deterrent coatings eliminating precision forming and cutting machines required for surface area control of extruded propellants Safety was improved by performing most of the manufacturing process in water Olin subsidiaries began manufacturing ball powder specification WC846 for 303 British ammunition during World War II Hodgdon Powder Company salvaged 80 tons of WC846 propellant from disassembled 303 British military rifle cartridges in 1949 and sold the propellant to handloading civilians as BL type C The C was to indicate the propellant burned cooler than traditional Improved Military Rifle IMR propellants Olin continued manufacturing WC846 for both civilian ammunition and 7.62Å~51mm NATO cartridges after the war
Constituents
Olin's material safety data sheet indicates the following composition of ball propellant
Comparison with IMR propellants
Aside from the manufacturing advantages ball propellants metered more uniformly through measuring machinery used to load cartridges had a longer storage life in loaded cartridges and reduced erosion of rifle barrels when those cartridges were fired On the other hand ball propellant loadings were more difficult to ignite produced brighter muzzle flash and left heavier fouling in rifle barrels than had been common with IMR propellants Some ball propellants burned satisfactorily over a narrower pressure range than IMR propellants and some handloaders accustomed to IMR propellants had difficulty determining appropriate charges for the unique components they were assembling Light loads might fail to ignite and burn properly while heavier loads might cause abrupt pressure increases to dangerous levels
Fouling difficulties increased as military loadings shifted from the 303 British and 7.62 NATO to the 5.56Å~45mm NATO Some propellant lots clogged the gas tube of M16 rifles until concentrations of calcium carbonate stabilizers were reduced in 1970 as reformulated WC844 for the 5.56mm NATO cartridge Civilian handloaders experienced similar fouling problems with smaller bore diameters Some attributed the problem to residues of unburned deterrent coatings and suggested using magnum primers to improve ignition and burning at lower pressures Ignition was ultimately improved by blending in a small percentage of uncoated propellant granules to improve the performance of standard primers
Expanded handloading options
Hodgdon's original 80 tons of surplus BL-C introduced ball propellants to handloaders and handloaders were ready to pay for newly manufactured ball propellants when the surplus supply was exhausted about 1960

56th Infantry Brigade Combat Team United States

The 56th Infantry Brigade Combat Team is a unit of the Texas Army National Guard and subordinate to the 36th Infantry Division
Early history
At the start of World War I the War Department organized two National Guard Cavalry brigades as part of the ArmyÅfs wartime expansion and assigned them to relieve regular Army Cavalry brigades patrolling the Mexico-United States border after the Pancho Villa Expedition The unit allocated to Texas was fielded as 1st Texas Cavalry Brigade and commanded by Brigadier General Jacob F Wolters namesake of Fort Wolters The War Department planned to mobilize the brigade for overseas service but the war ended before training was complete and soldiers were demobilized in late 1918 and early 1919
The brigade was reorganized as 1st Cavalry Brigade on August 23 1919 and General Wolters remained in command The task organization for the brigade also included the 111th Cavalry Regiment in New Mexico
Post-World War I
In 1921 the 1st Cavalry Brigade was renamed the 56th Cavalry Brigade and assigned to the 23rd Cavalry Division as part of the ArmyÅfs post-World War I reorganization of the National Guard
Soldiers of the 56th Cavalry were called out several times to quell civil disturbances including the Longview Race Riot of 1919 the Galveston Longshoreman's Strike of 1920 the Mexia and Borger Oil Field Booms of 1922 and 1929 the booms in the East Texas oil fields in 1931 and 1932 and the response following a hurricane in 1932 Wolters commanded troops on state active duty so often that he published a manual on use of the National Guard in reestablishing law and order following riots and natural disasters
In 1929 the 111th Cavalry Regiment was made a separate organization and the newly organized 124th Cavalry Regiment was added to the 56th Cavalry Brigade making it a completely Texas National Guard organization
World War II
In 1940 the 56th Cavalry Brigade headquarters was federalized for World War II The 56th was the last cavalry brigade in the United States to have horses and in 1944 the headquarters was reorganized as the 56th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop Mechanized The new unit was demobilized in November 1945 following the end of World War II The brigade headquarters and re-organized reconnaissance troop did not deploy overseas or see combat but the 112th and 124th Cavalry the regiments previously assigned to the 56th Cavalry Brigade did serve overseas
Post-World War II
The post-World War II reorganization of the National Guard included the creation of several armored divisions among them the 49th Armored Division in Texas The 56th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop was reorganized as Headquarters and Headquarters Company Combat Command A 49th Armored Division and stationed in Fort Worth
In October 1961 the unit was federalized for during the Berlin crisis and trained at Fort Polk and other locations before being demobilized
The headquarters of Combat Command A was reorganized in 1963 and the new unit was designated Headquarters and Headquarters Company 2nd Brigade 49th Armored Division
In 1968 the 2nd BrigadeÅfs headquarters was re-designated as Headquarters 49th Armored Group and relieved from assignment to the 49th Armored Division
In 1971 another reorganization resulted in the renaming of the 49th Armored GroupÅfs headquarters as Headquarters 49th Armored Brigade
A 1973 reorganization re-designated the unit Headquarters 2nd Brigade 49th Armored Division
Recent history
Following the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 56th IBCT soldiers and units performed extended active duty for Operations Noble Eagle Enduring Freedom Iraqi Freedom and
The 49th Armored Division was inactivated in 2004 and the reorganized division was fielded as the 36th Infantry Division 2nd Brigade 49th Armored Division was reorganized and renamed 56th Infantry Brigade 36th Infantry Division
The 56th Infantry Brigade Combat Team deployed to Iraq in 2005 and performed convoy command and control and convoy security duty as part of Multi-National Corps ? Iraq
In 2008 and 2009 the 56th IBCT returned to Iraq and performed convoy and base security force duties
3rd Battalion 144th Infantry deployed to Afghanistan in 2012

Education in Paris

In the early 9th century the emperor Charlemagne mandated all churches to give lessons in reading writing and basic arithmetic to their parishes and cathedrals to give a higher-education in the finer arts of language physics music and theology at that time Paris was already one of France's major cathedral towns and beginning its rise to fame as a scholastic centre By the early 13th century the Ile de la Cite Notre-Dame cathedral school had many famous teachers and the controversial teachings of some of these led to the creation of a separate Left-Bank Sainte-Genevieve University that would become the centre of Paris's scholastic Latin Quarter best represented by the Sorbonne university
Twelve centuries later education in Paris and the Paris region Ile-de-France region employs approximately 330,000 people 170,000 of which are teachers and professors teaching approximately 2.9?million children and students in around 9,000 primary secondary and higher education schools and institutions
Primary and secondary education
Paris is home to several of France's most prestigious high-schools such as Lycee Louis-le-Grand Lycee Henri-IV Lycee Janson de Sailly and Lycee Condorcet Other high-schools of international renown in the Paris area include the Lycee International de Saint Germain-en-Laye and the Ecole Active Bilingue Jeannine Manuel
Higher-education
In the academic year 2004?2005 the Paris Region's 17 public universities with its 359,749 registered students comprised the largest concentration of university students in Europe The Paris Region's prestigious grandes ecoles and scores of university-independent private and public schools have an additional 240,778 registered students that together with the university population creates a grand total of 600,527 students in higher education that year
Universities
The cathedral of Notre-Dame was the first centre of higher-education before the creation of the University of Paris Le Sorbonne which was founded in about 1150 The universitas was chartered by King Philip Augustus in 1200 as a corporation granting teachers and their students the right to rule themselves independently from crown law and taxes At the time many classes were held in open air Non-Parisian students and teachers would stay in hostels or colleges created for the boursiers coming from afar
Already famous by the 13th century the University of Paris had students from all of Europe Paris's Rive Gauche scholastic centre dubbed Latin Quarter as classes were taught in Latin then would eventually regroup around the college created by Robert de Sorbon from 1257 the College de Sorbonne
In 1991 four more universities were created in the suburbs of Paris reaching a total of seventeen public universities for the Paris Ile-de-France region These new universities were given names based on the name of the suburb in which they are located and not numbers like the previous thirteen University of Cergy-Pontoise University of Evry Val d'Essonne University of Marne-la-Vallee Ecole superieure Robert De Sorbon and University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines
Grandes ecoles
The Paris region hosts France's highest concentration of the prestigious grandes ecoles ? specialised centres of higher-education outside the public university structure The prestigious public universities are usually considered grands etablissements Most of the grandes ecoles were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded city of Paris though the Ecole Normale Superieure has remained on rue d'Ulm in the 5th arrondissement
The Paris area hosts 55 grandes ecoles including a high number of engineering schools some of them led by the prestigious Paris Institute of Technology ParisTech which comprises several colleges such as Arts et Metiers ParisTech Ecole Polytechnique Ecole des Mines AgroParisTech Telecom Paris and Ecole des Ponts et Chaussees Other prestigious engineering schools are located in Paris including Ecole Centrale Paris considered one of the top 3 in France and Supelec There are also many business schools including INSEAD ESSEC HEC and ESCP Europe The administrative school such as ENA has been relocated to Strasbourg the political science school Sciences-Po is still located in Paris's left bank 7th arrondissement The Parisian school of journalism CELSA departement of the Paris-Sorbonne University is located in Neuilly-sur-Seine
The grandes ecoles system is supported by a number of preparatory schools that offer courses of two to three years duration called Classes Preparatoires also known as classes prepas or simply prepas These courses provide entry to the grandes ecoles Many of the best prepas are located in Paris including Lycee Louis-le-Grand Lycee Henri-IV Lycee Saint-Louis Lycee Janson de Sailly and Lycee Stanislas Two other top-ranking prepas Lycee Hoche and Lycee prive Sainte-Genevieve are located in Versailles near Paris Student selection is based on school grades and teacher remarks Prepas are known to be very demanding in terms of work load and psychological stress

Former Stamford A.F.C chairman Chris Rivett formed the multi-discipline sporting club in 2013 Rivett the managing director of Final Third Sports Media an award-winning company that he set up in 2005 explained when announcing the club's creation I have been very flattered by the opportunities that have come my way since leaving Stamford However having spent time considering whether I wished to take up another role exclusively in football I started to look at the alternatives and the chance to build a brand new club structured around modern beliefs and values really appeals to me It is something that just doesn't happen these days not from scratch
I feel very passionately about doing something community-focused that benefits grassroot clubs and local schools upwards and not just in one sports code Multi-sport disciplines are very common on the continent as well as in America and I've seen first-hand the additional benefits they offer a community
ÅgHaving worked at the Games the Olympic News Service the ideology of inspiring a generation has become almost a cliche to some but for most who were directly involved and certainly me personally that has been a big focus since the Olympics and it is my intention to set something up that will benefit the local sport scene in a variety of ways
At the initial stages of bouncing the idea around to industry contacts I was hoping someone would tell me it was a mad idea but quite the contrary the level of enthusiasm for the project has been encouraging and we are already very close to announcing the first branch of the club that we are confident will attract Team GB Olympians to represent it
We are also at the preliminary stage of conversations with other sporting codes about becoming part of the Olympic Catuvellauni family
Handball
It was announced on June 20 2013 the first Olympic legacy Olympic Catuvellauni team would compete in Handball
The side based in Milton Keynes England is an affiliate to the EHA and will be managed by the 2012 Great Britain Handball team goalkeeper and captain Bobby White They will compete in the Midlands development league for the 2013 season


Leaflet software

Leaflet is a widely used open source JavaScript library used to build web mapping applications First released in 2011 it supports most mobile and desktop platforms supporting HTML5 and CSS3 Alongside OpenLayers and the Google Maps API it is one of the most popular JavaScript mapping libraries and is now used by major web sites such as FourSquare Pinterest and Flickr
Leaflet allows developers without a GIS background to very easily display tiled web maps hosted on a public server with optional tiled overlays It can load feature data from GeoJSON files style it and create interactive layers such as markers with popups when clicked
It is developed by Vladimir Agafonkin who joined MapBox in 2013
Use
A typical use of Leaflet involves binding a Leaflet map element to an HTML element such as a div Layers and markers are then added to the map element
codice_1
The Leaflet library itself is accessible through the variable codice_2
Features
Leaflet supports Web Map Service WMS layers GeoJSON layers Vector layers and Tile layers natively Many other types of layers are supported via plugins
Like other web map libraries the basic display model implemented by Leaflet is one basemap plus zero or more translucent overlays with zero or more vector objects displayed on top
Elements
The major Leaflet object types are
There are also a variety of utility classes such as interfaces for managing projections transformations and interacting with the DOM
Support for GIS formats
Leaflet has core support for few GIS standard formats with others supported in plugins
Browser support
Leaflet 0.7 supports Chrome Firefox Safari 5+ Opera 12+ and IE 7-11
Comparison with other libraries
Leaflet is directly comparable with OpenLayers as both are open source client-side only JavaScript libraries The library as a whole is much smaller around 6500 lines of code compared to 21,000 as of 2014 It has a much smaller code footprint than OpenLayers around 33 kb vs 950kb due partly to its modular structure The code base is newer and takes advantage of recent features of JavaScript plus HTML5 and CSS3 However Leaflet lacks features OpenLayers supports such as Web Feature Service WFS and native support for projections other than Google Web Mercator EPSG 3785
It is also comparable to the proprietary closed source Google Maps API debuting in 2005 and Bing Maps API both of which incorporate a significant server-side component to provide services such as geocoding routing search and integration with features such as Google Earth Google Maps API provides speed and simplicity but is flexible and can only be used to access Google Maps services The new DataLayer part of Google's API does allow external data sources to be displayed however
History
Leaflet began life in 2010 as Web Maps API a JavaScript library for the CloudMade mapping provider where Agafonkin worked at the time In May 2011 CloudMade announced the first release of Leaflet built from scratch but using parts of the old API code
This release introduced Retina support and many usability and user experience improvements
This release expanded the API's range of methods and events improved usability and added GeoJSON saving It was completed in a 2 day code sprint supported by Mapbox
This release focused on bug fixing announcing that refactoring and potential backward incompatibilities would come soon

Bodh Gaya bombings

On 7 July 2013 a series of ten bombs exploded in and around the Mahabodhi Temple complex a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Bodh Gaya India Five people including two Buddhist monks were injured by the blasts Three other devices were defused by bomb-disposal squads at a number of locations in Gaya
The temple itself and the Bodhi Tree where Gautama Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment were undamaged However the Archaeological Survey of India confirmed damage to new structures in the temple complex International figures including the Dalai Lama Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Myanmar Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi condemned the attacks On 4 November 2013 the National Investigation Agency announced that the Indian Mujahideen was responsible for the bombings
Bombings
The Mahabodhi Mahavihara is an important temple for Buddhists worldwide The bombs exploded between 05:30 and 06:00 IST 00:30?01:00 UTC concurrently with the Sutta chanting and meditation which begin the daily routine of the mahavihara
Four of the blasts occurred within the Mahabodhi Temple complex
Five blasts occurred in Gaya within a 500-metre radius of the Mahabodhi Temple complex
Indian Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said on 8 July that there were ten blasts not nine as earlier reported it was unclear where the tenth bomb detonated Despite the blasts BTMC monks opened the main sanctuary of the temple for routine prayer and rituals
Bomb-disposal squads defused three more bombs which did not explode because the analog timers in them failed The bomb-detection team separated the detonator from the power source to defuse these bombs
Three pamphlets handwritten in Urdu were reportedly found with the defused bombs Code words in two of the pamphlets seemed to describe the locations where the bombs would be planted while the third pamphlet included the phrase Revenge for Iraq
Investigation
On 8 July the Bihar Police released CCTV footage of the blast sites at the Mahabodhi Temple and based on an analysis of the footage sketches of the suspected attackers Sahidur and Saifur Rehman brothers from Scotland and Saudi Arabia respectively were identified from the sketches both are alleged Indian Mujahideen IM operatives Another man Vinod Mistri was also arrested since his identity card was found at the blast site However Mistri claimed to have lost his card days before the blasts National Investigation Agency NIA released Mistri on 10 July for lack of evidence after taking his statement An alleged IM tweet claimed responsibility for the Bodh Gaya bombings on the day of the blasts warning that Mumbai would be the next target The IP address was traced to Pakistan and NIA investigated the claim
On 16 July NIA released the sketches and a video clip of a suspect in the bombings According to the agency the suspect in Bhikkhu clothing planted four bombs in the Mahabodhi complex Witnesses noticed that the suspect performed Parikrama incorrectly NIA reported that the suspected bomber intended to blow up the main statue of the Buddha but did not enter the sanctuary because prayers had already begun
Investigators discovered that the 13 Lotus timers used in the bombings were bought at a shop in Guwahati They also ascertained that the clocks attached to the unexploded bombs were manufactured at a factory in Rajkot Gujarat The cylinders attached to the bombs were obtained in Bihar so NIA suspected local involvement
Investigators also confirmed that the bombs used in Patna and Bodh Gaya were nearly identical one of the many similarities investigated was in the way the bombs were planted On 4 November 2013 NIA raided a lodge in Ranchi finding evidence of a plot to bomb pilgrimage sites The evidence included a map of planned bombings and the coded names of the terrorists An NIA agent confirmed that the charts they recovered matched precisely
The evidence confirmed that the Ranchi cell of the IM was responsible for the blasts According to reports Imtiaz Ansari placed a bomb near the Thai Monastery and Ainul a.k.a Tariq placed one at the Tergar Monastery Mujib placed bombs at four locations in Bodh Gaya The six-person attacking squad allegedly worked in pairs and was assigned to place three bombs each NIA named the five bomb planters who planned the attack over a year ago Hyder Ali Imtiaz Ansari Tariq a.k.a Ainul and Taufeeq and Mujibal Ansari The agency suspects that Ali masterminded the plot with guidance from Tehseen Akhtar a Ranchi-based IM operative Investigators suspect that Riyaz Bhatkal a Pakistani IM leader commanded the attack
Alleged warnings
Some members of the media blamed the Bihar Police saying the blasts resulted from a lack of security at the management and operational levels The metal detectors at the Mahabodhi Temple were not calibrated to detect bombs and there were only four guards on duty when the blasts occurred A security expert said The decision to let the Bodh Gaya Management Committee man security inside the premises is preposterous and immature Questioned by NIA in the US in June 2010 about the 2008 Mumbai attacks David Headley claimed that Lashkar-e-Taiba prepared a video on the Mahabodhi Temple and was planning to trigger blasts there The IM responsible for the 2012 Pune bombings revealed plans to attack the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya in October 2012 In April 2013 the NIA issued a list of alleged IM operatives including Gaya-born Amir Reza Khan alias Parvez alias Rizwan alias Muttaki a resident of the village of Maheyan in Mohanpur Gaya who was the sixth wanted member of the list
Reza perpetrator of the Bangalore and Pune blasts is suspected to have provided reconnaissance on the Mahabodhi Temple site The Intelligence Bureau IB issued several warnings one in 2012 and two in 2013 The Bihar Police were alerted in June 2013 about the targets by the IB and on 2 July the IB alerted them about the entry of two suspects into Gaya The Ministry of Home Affairs warned on 3 July that the temple was a target The warnings caused a Bihar Police meeting the same day about security at the Mahabodhi Temple but the blasts occurred within 100 hours The treasurer of All India Bhiku Sangha Pragya Deep said The administration had prior information There was a report of the IB A series of security review meetings have been conducted There have been at least five to six meetings ItÅfs shameful that despite this the blasts have taken place This is a mistake on the part of the administration After the blast Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar said The government had always been on the alert and taken steps to ensure the security of the Mahabodhi temple and Bodh Gaya in general A senior official of the IB said The Bodh Gaya temple was a long standing target and we had been reminding the Bihar state agencies about it But our warnings were not taken seriously
Perpetrators
As of 9 July 2013 no group had yet claimed responsibility for the attacks and there was considerable media speculation about who might be to blame The possibility was raised that the blasts might have been revenge attacks by Pakistan-based groups in response to the persecution of Muslim minorities in Myanmar by Buddhists Similar Muslim-Buddhist tensions in Sri Lanka and Thailand were also raised as possible motives for the bombings A Myanmar-based Al-Qaeda affiliate Jamatal Tahawid Jihad was mentioned as a possible culprit although the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs ruled that out The IM was also mentioned in connection with the blasts an IM operative Sayeed Maqbool reportedly confessed during interrogation by the Delhi Police that he carried out the attacks Prime Minister of Sri Lanka D M Jayaratne speculated that it might have been perpetrated by supporters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam The Bihar Police suspected Maoist connections to the bombings but the Maoists denied their involvement
Reactions
Indian President Pranab Mukherjee called the blasts a senseless act of violence targeting innocent pilgrims and monks who had gathered to worship at this temple dedicated to the great apostle of peace?Gautama Buddha Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh condemned the incident saying that India's composite culture and traditions teach us respect for all religions and such attacks on religious places will never be tolerated A national organisation of Buddhist monks the All India Bhiku Sangha also reacted to the attacks Its chairperson Bhante Sadanand Mahasthaver said Buddhist monks all over the country feel saddened by the attack The international community is also shaken We try to put people on the right path and we have been made the target of an attack The All India Bhiku Sangha condemns this attack This should not have happened We spread the message of peace across the world This is an attempt to spread terror and create discord among the messengers of peace The Rajya Sabha condemned the attacks on Mahabodhi Temple Chairman Mohammad Hamid Ansari described the attacks as senseless act of violence and a cause of anguish and deep concern to all The Government of Bihar proposed to establish an Anti Terrorist Squad unit in the state after the bombings

Eugene Pittard

Eugene Pittard 1867?1962 was Swiss anthropologist notable for his work Les Races et l Histoire published in 1924
Early life
Pittard was born on June 5 1867 Even as a child Pittard showed a predilection for collecting and observing people and artifacts He had a small collection consisting of fossils bones and coins which he hoped to some day submit to Karl Vogt
Teaching career
Pittard founded the Museum of Ethnography at the University of Geneva He was also the first chair of anthropology at the University Later he was appointed to the post of rector of the Academy Apart from his various positions and roles in the University of Geneva he was also the project manager for the League of Nations He was also one of the stalwarts of the Albanian Red Cross
The Anthropologist
Pittard's fascination with anthropology began during a stay in Paris It was followed by a doctoral thesis on anthropology in 1898 Although Pittard was a popular teacher and charismatic personality in the lecture rooms he is most remembered as a scientist The crux of his thesis involved an extensive study of the skulls recovered from the ossuaries in Valais But he was also deeply interested in the ancient people of the Balkans This particular interest of led to his fascination with the Gypsies His work and findings in these areas of study and their subsequent publication catapulted him to the higher echelons of the anthropological sphere A seminal anthropologist his biggest contribution to anthropology is regarded as the perspective he expounded of studying humans in their entirety as more than biological creatures
Pittard was also of the opinion that the descriptive methods in vogue during his times were ineffective in the study of humans He also stated that the anthropometric approach and that of race as fundamental basis of research were useless in studying and describing human beings He published his research findings in a book in 1924 entitled Races and History
Nearly two decades before the Second World War began and the Nazi propaganda for the need to preserve a pure breed of people Pittard had declared that there wasn't a pure breed of people in Europe This was a claim at that time since Pittard was speculating albeit based on his vast experience of studying people But when genetics developed significantly in the 1960s it came to be known that Pittard had been right
Recognition and Awards
Pittard's ground-breaking works were duly recognized He received many awards during his lifetime At any time he was an honorary member of or corresponding to a multitude of scientific societies in Paris Stockholm Rome Berlin and London Another remarkable aspect of Pittard was his distaste for decorations and awards He is said to have kept his awards in a bottom drawer among other articles like an old grocery horn His youth and early days as a researcher were spent in penury always lacking funds to pursue his scholarly interests It was perhaps this that produced in him a distrust of the significance of awards in a scholar's life

CrossRoads Ministry

CrossRoads Ministry is an outreach ministry of St William Church in Louisville Kentucky that conducts urban retreats focused on social justice The retreats are based on themes from the Gospel and Catholic Social Teaching Since its inception in 2000 CrossRoads has hosted approximately 10,000 young people on its retreats
History
CrossRoads was established in 2000 as an outreach of St William Church a parish which claims to be a peacemaking community in the spirit of Vatican Council II and which has founded a number of justice initiatives during its 100-year history Parish leaders designed CrossRoads as a way to involve its youth members in the church's activism and justice efforts After receiving a grant from the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth CrossRoads hired Shannon Queenan as its first director in 2000 and began offering retreats for local high school and college students The organization has grown steadily since and now hosts adult participants as well as young people In FY 2012-2013 CrossRoads hosted 66 groups totaling about 1,400 participants
Retreats
CrossRoads is situated in West Louisville which is among the most economically depressed urban areas in the United States The poverty rate in West Louisville is 42% compared with a regional average of 12.4% Many retreat participants are young people from suburban areas who are often unfamiliar with West Louisville and do not know many people who live there On CrossRoads retreats participants take walks around the neighborhood visiting various social service agencies?homeless shelters refugee resettlement facilities and centers for people with mental disabilities?and meeting people who use services at those agencies Participants eat lunch at soup kitchens and interact with refugees who are enrolled in English classes After these visits participants return to the retreat center where they and retreat facilitators use prayer and reflection to process their experiences
Whereas many organizations adopt a helping/volunteer model for their programs CrossRoads retreats focus on personal interactions with people who are at the margins The participants form relationships with people they might otherwise not meet because of their different social positions Those unlikely relationships according to the organization's model encourage participants to understand their experiences in a broader context of social justice rather than in a context of service which might not call those societal issues into question

Louis Berry

Louis Berry October 9 1914 - May 3 1998 was the first African American permitted to practice law in his native formerly segregated city of Alexandria in Rapides Parish in Central Louisiana
Background
A son of Frank Berry Sr a tailor and grocer in Alexandria Louis Berry graduated in 1941 from historically black Howard University School of Law in Washington D.C
On August 1 1945 Berry became the first African-American admitted to the practice of law in Louisiana since A P Tureaud in 1927 Berry hoped to join Tureaud's law practice in New Orleans but Tureaud could not financially take on another lawyer at that time Instead Berry practiced with John Perkins who was licensed in Mississippi not Louisiana In 1947 with the opening of Southern University Law Center in Baton Rouge several black lawyers were recruited to join the faculty.Berry served as dean of Southern Law Center from 1972 to 1974
Legal practice
Berry returned to his native Alexandria sometimes prior to 1950 Under the custom of the time a new lawyer had to be introduced to the local bar association When other white attorneys turned down Berry and privately ridiculed him Camille Gravel a high-powered criminal defense lawyer with political connections in both Baton Rouge and Washington called Berry and offered to introduce him to their legal colleagues This action was considered politically courageous in the segregated system of the American South.Berry filled the role as the only black lawyer in Alexandria much as Jesse N Stone later the president of the Southern University System in Baton Rouge had done in Shreveport
Berry worked with black ministers in Rapides Parish to register African-American citizens under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 Passage of the law signed by U.S President Lyndon B Johnson led to a large increase in black voter participation in Alexandria The former civics test covering highlights of the Constitution of the United States was dropped as a condition for registration
The Alexandria Daily Town Talk attributed much of the improvement in living conditions in the black community to Berry's activism The newspaper quoted Berry as having said Young people will be surprised to know the conditions under which blacks had to exist at the time for they really had no rights that anybody was bound to respect
In 1996 some two years before his death in Lafayette Louisiana Berry was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield Camille Gravel had been inducted a year earlier in 1995

Production notes
The Ted Knight Show was Ted Knights first attempt at starring in a show of his own after his long and successful run from 1970 to 1977 as newsman Ted Baxter in The Mary Tyler Moore Show After its pilot Mr Dennis Steps Out was broadcast on October 26 1977 as the fifth episode of the second season of the situation comedy Busting Loose The Ted Knight Show was spun off as its own series in the spring of 1978 A disappointment The Ted Knight Show drew low ratings and was cancelled after only six weeks on the air Episode director Joel Zwick later said that in his opinion CBS had thought that Knights star power would carry the show but that the premise of a situation comedy centering around an escort service was too strange for the show to succeed Knight meanwhile said that in retrospect it had been a mistake for him to star in a new show so soon after the conclusion of The Mary Tyler Moore Show
Lowell Ganz and Mark Rothman created the show which CBS broadcast on Saturday at 8:30?p.m throughout its brief run It was filmed in color before a live studio audience at CBS-TV
Knight would go on to much greater success in the 1980s in his next starring role in the situation comedy Too Close For Comfort ? itself retitled The Ted Knight Show in its final season

Mesoamerican Society for Ecological Economics

The Mesoamerican Society for Ecological Economics SMEE is a regional chapter of the International Society for Ecological Economics ISEE After its foundation in 2008 at Guatemala City the organization has already celebrated its first International Conference in 2010 at Mexico City and will carry out the second International Conference EcoEco Alternatives between March 4 and 8 2014 at the main campus of the University of Costa Rica
This branch of the ISEE has a unique emphasis within ecological economics Topics like social justice and the human value in environmental conservation prevail in this region As a consequence of the strong influence from Joan Martinez Alier's environmentalism of the poor or social environmentalism major attention is given to ecological-distributive conflicts Alier insists that in the South a struggle exists against these conflicts generated by economic growth mainly by the North These endeavors attempt to preserve the access of the communities to natural resources and services
On top of the negative effects on the environment by economic distribution the cultural influence is also widely debated For instance the anthropologist Arturo Escobar suggests that culturally-driven preferences are one of the main factors degrading the environment For example society naturally gives privilege to the capitalist model that distributes natural resources with the purposes of production and profit instead of endorsing the agroforestal ecosystem model which is less harmful to the environment As part of this alternate perception in Mesoamerica Ecological economics doesn't consider that the economic valuation of natural resources nor environmental norms are effective solutions to these social-environmental conflicts On the other hand an alternative based on community-based conservation and the management of sustainability is more advocated upon By adding the latter cultural perspective the three pillars of sustainable development the social environmental and economic end up being addressed by these proponents
History
After the second biennial meeting of the International Society for Ecological Economics in 1994 at San Jose Costa Rica several professionals in the region became interested in creating a branch of this organization in their own countries to respond to the increasing development and worsening of social-environmental conflicts by the conventional-economics-based policies
However it wasn't until 2008 that the efforts of the Latin American Social Sciences Institute in Guatemala the International Center for Political Economy at the National University of Costa Rica and the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico resulted in the Ecological Economics Forum May 26 and 27 2008 at Guatemala City with the participation of zealous youth students and 50 professionals of Mesoamerica
Highly-recognized experts spoke such as Alejandro Nadal Coordinator of the working group on the Environment Macroeconomics Trade and Investments of the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN David Barkin and Roberto Constantino from the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico Eduardo Garcia Frapolli from the Center for Ecosystem Research of the National Autonomous University of Mexico Bernardo Aguilar of Prescott College AZ U.S and Executive Director of the Fundacion Neotropica in Costa Rica Miguel Martinez of the World Wide Fund for Nature WWF Guatemala and Juan Pablo Castaneda of the Institute of Agriculture Natural Resources and the Environment of the Rafael Landivar University in Guatemala
This meeting undertook the writing of the organization's Constitution and the election of the first Board of Directors Under the lead of the first President M Sc Iliana Monterroso of Guatemala the consolidation of the legal inscription and statutes took place
According to the Forum's participants the main objectives of the SMEE are to create an open field for discussion of the methodological and theoretical development of Ecological economics to promote interdisciplinary multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary scientific research and to support academic initiatives related to this thematic in the region
In 2010 the First International and Biennial Conference of the SMEE was celebrated at the Ecological Park of Xochimilco Mexico City from November 22 to the 26th Very influential speakers such as Fander Falconi David Barkin Mario Perez and Carlos Munoz Pina lectured about and discussed the Ecological economics platform for the advancement of social justice environmental justice and the principles of sustainability
Since then the new Board of Directors has had to deal with a shortage of memberships and the last financial crisis but despite these challenges it has achieved important progress in creating its website and completing several ecological economics studies and projects with the Fundacion Neotropica Furthermore the organization foresees the inauguration of a professional Master's program on ecological economics and political ecology at the University for International Cooperation and the proceeding of the 2014 EcoEco Alternatives Biennial Conference
Boards of Directors
The Board of Directors rotates every two years and is usually elected around the biennial conference The next election will take place in March 2014
First Board of Directors 2008-2011
Second Board of Directors 2011-2014
Current Board of Directors 2014-2016
EcoEco Alternatives 2014 Conference
The Second International Conference of the Mesoamerican Society for Ecological Economics will take place at the Rodrigro Facio campus of the University of Costa Rica from March 4 to the 8th 2014 with the support of the School of Biology and the Fundacion Neotropica Its purpose is to further the debate on Ecological economics and to sensitize more people about the importance of the ecological crisis and the solutions proposed by this school of thought
The Conference's thematic will be Advancing Towards Alternatives for People and Ecosystems in Latin America It will include multidisciplinary interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary debates about the resolution of social-environmental conflicts the alternatives within the ecological economics model for handling production and services and the social conflicts related to the distribution of wealth and gender


The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart

The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart is the thirteenth studio album by the Brazilian metal band Sepultura It was released on October 25 2013 in Europe on October 29 in the United States via Nuclear Blast It is the band's first album to feature drummer Eloy Casagrande and the first album by the band to be recorded in the United States since 1998's Against The album was produced by Ross Robinson who previously produced the band's 1996 album Roots
Background
The band hinted at a thirteenth studio album as early as May 2012 when guitarist Andreas Kisser told Metal Underground that Sepultura would soon start working on something new with drummer who joined in 2011 Eloy and see if they could get ready for new music early next year Later Kisser revealed that Sepultura was already thinking about new ideas for their next album and was going to have something new going on in 2013
On December 10 2012 producer Ross Robinson who produced Sepultura's Roots album hinted on Twitter that he would be producing the new album tweeting Oh didn't mention Spoke to Andreas it's on My vision smoke Roots- It can be done which was later confirmed with another announcement that Steve Evetts would be co-producing the album
By April 2013 the band had 13 songs in development with Kisser commenting positively about the progress of the album saying This is the first time writing with Eloy Casagrande on drums and everything sounds fresh(...)You'll just have to wait to hear it It's very difficult to describe what we're doing but I can say that will be one of the strongest Sepultura albums to date In May vocalist Derrick Green reported We have written most of the music already and now we are working on lyrics for the album We should have everything ready before we hit the studio June 1st
On June 10 during the recording of the album the band announced that they had six songs recorded for the album and according to Kisser they were going in a rate of two songs a day Later that month it was announced that former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo would make a guest appearance on the album with Kisser explaining When the mics were all ready and running Eloy and Dave started playing and the magic was on so great The part they recorded will be a special part on the middle of one of the songs it came out crazy
On July 12 it was announced that the band has completed recording the album and a week later they announced that it would be called The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart
Musical style
Vocalist Derrick Green described the album's sound as really sinister dark and metal as hell whilst guitarist Andreas Kisser said that the album is brutal fast and straight to the point They also commented positively on the input of new drummer Eloy Casagrande with Green explaining It's been great working with Eloy in the writing process because it brings a whole different energy to the music The many changes that have been going on in our lives and in the world also add to the making of the new album
Concept
Guitarist Andreas Kisser said of the album title I was inspired by a phrase which is the main message of the story ÅgThe mediator between the head and hands must be the heartÅh to express what we are saying on the lyrics Although the album was inspired by the 1927 film Metropolis it is not intended to be a concept album unlike two of the band's previous studio albums Dante XXI based on Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy and A-Lex based on the 1962 book A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess As guitarist Andreas Kisser explains
In the movie a crazy millionaire wants to transform a robot into a real person ThatÅfs kind of the opposite of what we live today More than ever we are robotized through the worldwide web Google glasses chips under our skins and the globalized slavery our society suffers nowadays The phrase points to the heart as being the human factor who keeps a man a man not a robot The heart beats with freedom of choice we have to think by ourselves to create a real world not a matrix Being a novel written in the early 1920Åås itÅfs almost prophetical It helped us to put the ideas together for the lyrics to express what we see today I live in Sao Paulo Brasil one of the big metropolis in the world with more than 20,000,000 people living and working in it I know how it is to live in daily chaos our music reflects a lot of that feeling
Reception
Ray Van Horn Jr from Blabbermouth gave the album 8 of 10 stars stating that most people should come out of this listening session pleased by the results Matt Hinch from About.com said that Mediator is arguably SepulturaÅfs best album this millennium and I'm sure some will even say since Chaos A.D and gave the album 4 of 5 stars The album sold over 1,800 copies in the United States in its first week of release

Dallara GC21

The Dallara GC21 was a Le Mans Prototype built by Dallara for the Fuji Grand Champion Series and based on one of the company's Formula Three cars It was raced between 2002 and 2007 competing in the LMP2 class of the Japan Le Mans Challenge in the last two years of its usage A GC21 entered by MYZ won the LMP2 category of the Japan Le Mans Challenge in 2006
History
In 2002 the Fuji Grand Champion Series was revived under the GC21 name Dallara were tasked with building a car for the series and converted one of their Formula Three cars into the Le Mans Prototype-style Dallara GC21 The GC21 featured the distinctive air intake of a F3 car but was fitted with a 2-litre turbocharged Toyota 3S-GTE straight-four engine in place of the naturally-aspirated units used in F3
The car's first race came in July 2002 the first of four races that year all of which were held at the Fuji Speedway circuit Jerome Dalla Lana driving for Inging became the first driver to win in the car with all five entries finishing the twelve lap event By the final race of the season held in November the grid had expanded to eight cars with Ronnie Quintarelli also driving for Inging winning the event Only once did a GC21 retire in 2002 Naozumi Itou retired from race three after three laps
2003 saw the series expand to a five-race event all of which were held at the Fuji Speedway track Shinsuke Yamazaki driving for Aim Sports won the first event held in March with six cars being entered Each of the following events had seven entries The final race of the season saw the first mechanically-attributed retirement the privateer Kazuhiko Yatsu suffered a gearbox failure after five laps in a race where Yamazaki won again Yamazaki won three races that year and took two further second places on the way to securing the title
For 2004 the series moved away from Fuji Speedway as the track was closed for redevelopment As a result four races were held at Twin-Ring Motegi as well as one at Sportsland Sugo Hiroki Saga driving for MYG won four races on the way to the title with the other race being won by Nova Engineering's Katsuaki Kubota However the entry list had decreased with no more than five drivers competing in any of the races Fuji Speedway reopened in 2005 and the GC-21 series returned there for all five races of the season Team I Line's Hiroaki Ishiura was dominant winning all five races
In 2006 the Japan Le Mans Challenge JLMC was run for the first time and the GC21 competed in that series in the LMP2 category as well as the GC-21 series which continued for one final season Yasuo Miyagawa won two races of the GC21 series whilst driving for RS Serizawa whilst Atsushi Katsumata won three races driving for MYG In the JLMC MYZ entered two GC21 in the season opener which was the Sugo 1000 km whilst Aim Sports entered a single GC21 The MYZ entries didn't have any success the #3 car driven by Masayuki Yamamoto Syougo Suhou and Jun'ichirou Yamashita retired whilst the #4 car driven by Yuuya Sakamoto Yoshihisa Namekata and Tomonobu Fujii wasn't classified However the Aim Sports car driven by Shinsuke Yamazaki Yuuji Asou and Masaru Tomizawa took the LMP2 class win and finished second overall At the Motegi 1000 km the two team's finishes were reversed the Aim Sports entry retired due to engine failure whilst both MYZ entries finished the #4 MYZ car took the class win and finished second overall whilst the #3 MYZ car finished third overall The #4 MYZ car won the LMP2 category again at the season finale which was the Okayama 1000 km whilst both of the other GC21s retired As a result MYZ won the LMP2 Team's Championship and Sakamoto Namekata and Fujii won the LMP2 Driver's Championship
2007 saw the JLMC expand to a four-race series whilst the GC21 was discontinued For the season opener which was the Sugo 1000 km two GC21s were entered one by Kazuyoshi Takamizawa and one by Aim Sports who entered Tomizawa Asou and Yoshitaka Kuroda Although Takamizawa did not attend the event Aim Sports did and finished fourth winning the LMP2 category Aim Sports were the only GC21 in the Fuji 1000 km and once more won their class finishing second overall Three GC21s were entered in the Motegi 1000 km the regular Aim Sports car was complemented by an entry from Forward Racing who had Takuya Shirasaka and Takeshi Itou driving for them as well as an entry from Rs Serizawa who ran Hiroshi Koizumi Tsubasa Kurosawa and Hiroaki Ishiura in their GC21 For the first time in the series the LMP2 category was won by another car the Max Racing-entered RS KK-LM won the class The Aim Sports GC21 finished fifth overall and second in class whilst the Forward Racing entry was not classified and the Rs Serizawa entry retired Aim Sports were once again the only entry in the season finale which was the Okayama 1000 km the team took an overall victory for the first time beating the Team Mugen Courage LC70 LMP1 by just over 28 seconds This would prove to be both the car's and the series last race as the JLMC was cancelled shortly after the Okayama 1000 km had finished

Usher was born in 1615 The medieval records known as the Hundred Rolls show that Usher came from the then hamlet of Bednall Green today's Bethnal Green in East London in England The Usher family line itself is believed to be originally from the town of Bednall Green The Usher family name is known in English history and literally means one who introduced strangers Usher and his brother Robert left Bednall Green aka Bethnal Green and settled in the thirteen colonies Usher came first to Cambridge As of 1642 he was the owner of a house in Cambridge northeast corner of Dunster and Winthrop that was the property of William Andrew in 1635 Later in 1645 Usher settled in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony He lived on the north side of Boston on State Street near the market-place Usher opened his first bookstore in Boston in 1647 His affairs prospered and by 1652 he had became a well known merchant and bookseller Robert his brother had settled in Stamford Connecticut
Career
Usher was a commercial merchant and a real estate investor He was the first known colonial bookseller Most of the items he had for sale in his business as a merchant were books One such book that he sold that was well received was the Bay Psalm Book the first book printed in the thirteen colonies The first edition was sold by Usher in Cambridge in 1640 and the fourth edition of the Bay Psalm Book was sold in Boston by Usher in 1652 He had also printed and distributed for free John Eliot's catechism in 1653
Usher was agent for the London Society of the Corporation for Propagating the Gospel in managing the money matters between the corporation established in England for spreading the New Testament among the Indians in America and the commissioners of the thirteen colonies in New England He was able to obtain paper and type fonts for printing the New Testament in the Indian language when he went to England in the winter of 1657/58 The printing items he received he put in charge of Samuel Green in 1659 at Cambridge to print the Indian New Testament and other works Usher distributed the Indian New Testaments free of charge from 1660 to 1663 Usher was the publisher of the laws of the Massachusetts Bay Colony for seven years under the monopoly he received from the Massachusetts General Court in 1672
Wives and families
Usher's first wife was Frances died February 25 1652
Their children were
Usher's second wife was Elizabeth Symmes daughter of Rev Zachary Symmes married September 2 1652
Their children in this family were
Usher's third wife was Mary Alford Butler daughter of William Alford and widow of Peter Butler They had no children She survived him and married Samuel Nowell of Charlestown Massachusetts
Death
Usher died in May of 1676 His will is dated 11 May 1676 and proved 19 May 1676 During his lifetime he had accumulated much wealth in selling books and publications Two of his sons quarreled over his estate which ultimately had to be settled in court The will of Usher talks about his sister Elizabeth Harwood and his brother-in-law John Harwood
Legacy
Usher was one of the founders of the First Church in Boston He was a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts Usher was interested in Boston civic matters and held several town positions He was elected selectman in 1659 a position he held until his death
His son also named Hezekiah Usher built a mansion in Boston in 1684 which was located at today's Tremont Street and Temple Place


Virtual concert

A virtual concert or V-concert refers to a performance in which the virtual avatars of singers are projected onto a stage in the form of three-dimensional images V-concerts enjoy a huge amount of popularity especially in South Korea where recent performances by virtual avatars of K-pop groups such as Girls Generation have attracted thousands of fans
History
Early beginnings
Within the K-pop music industry V-concerts were first introduced by several South Korean record labels such as SM Entertainment and YG Entertainment In 1998 SM Entertainment attempted to kick start its first holographic debut with H.O.T a now-defunct boy band but failed to do so
Revival of V-concerts and planned expansion
In January 5 2013 a breakthrough occurred after SM Entertainment held a V-concert in Gangnam District with life-sized images of GirlsÅf Generation projected onto the stage attracting thousands of K-pop fans
After its first V-concert featuring Psy's Gangnam Style took off at the COEX Convention & Exhibition Center in May 2013 the South Korean record label YG Entertainment announced that it plans to establish 20 venues for virtual performances of its K-pop singers by the year 2015 in North America Europe China Hong Kong Singapore and Thailand
On July 20 2013 YG Entertainment launched a permanent virtual concert at the Everland theme park in Yongin South Korea Under the slogan K-Pop Hologram YG at Everland virtual performances include Psy's Gentleman and Gangnam Style as well as virtual concerts by Big Bang and 2NE1
The first-ever virtual concert in Germany was launched on smartphone on August 5 2013 at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe
It is based on a unique concert which was staged on May 9 2008 at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe Specially composed for the occasion Vor dem Verstummen by Harald Weiss received its world premiere in the field of stelae when it was performed for an appreciative audience of thousands for the one and only time by musicians of the Berliner Kammersymphonie orchestra under the baton of celebrated conductor Lothar Zagrosek The sound experienced by each individual was different depending on his or her precise location amongst the stelae Now you just will need to visit the Memorial with your smartphone to experience the concert in all its unique interactivity The sound of the instruments changes depending on your location and route through the field of stelae growing louder or softer more passionate or muted This means that the concert you hear will be personal to you Outside the Memorial you can listen to the piece in offline mode in the conventional non-interactive way In order to stage this virtual concert a complex process was used to re-record all of the instruments in December 2012 Geo-coordinates were assigned to each individual instrument as well as to the female vocalist and a completely new type of software was developed This enables the instruments to be perceived in a virtual 3D space within the smartphone application and to simulate the concert at the Memorial The listenerÅfs location at the Memorial is identified using the smartphoneÅfs GPS function and the sound associated with those specific coordinates is determined Daniel-Jan Girl a member of the Board of Sponsors of the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe was the driving force behind the initiative He was particularly motivated by how future generations would regard the Holocaust and the issue of coming to terms with the past what form the culture of remembrance would take in the 21st century and how it could be made relevant to young people
Production costs
A virtual K-pop music video costs over US$180,000 and is about two to three times more expensive than a normal K-pop video
Criticism
V-concerts have been criticized by K-pop fans because singers do not appear in person and are only electronically projected onto a screen Some claim that V-concerts could possibly endanger the quality of live music


Electronic skin

Electronic skin or e-skin is a thin electronic material that mimics human skin in one or more ways Specifically human skin can sense pressure and temperature stretch and can heal itself Electronic skin aims to apply these functions to robotic and health applications
History
2010
In September 2010 a team from the University of California Berkeley announced preliminary results of their research into electronic skin They developed a technique to attach nanowire transistors to sticky substrate The resulting squares of superconductive material were imbedded in a thin pressure-sensitive rubber The resulting product was able to sense a wide range of pressures and capable of withstanding being bent 2000 times The researchers hoped the e-skin could be used to restore a sense of touch to patients with prosthetic limbs The research was funded in part by the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency The results were published in Nature Materials
In the same issue of Nature Materials a different electronic skin project by Stanford University headed by Zhenan Bao was also described The Stanford project focused on stretching an electricity-conducting-rubber membrane between two electrodes They developed a unique structure for the rubber that allowed it to regain its shape after pressure was applied previously the material would become too entangled at the micro-level to fully bounce back With up to 25 million sensors per square centimeter the skin was sensitive enough to detect a fly landing on it
2011
In February 2011 the Stanford team developed a stretchable solar cell that could be used to power their electronic skin An accordion-like micro-structure allowed the cells to stretch up to 30% without damage The team also added biological and chemical sensors to the skin to supplement the pressure sensors Bao said she imagined the artificial skin could one day be used on robot hands capable of detecting things such as disease or intoxication of humans via touch
In August 2011 an international team announced an electronic patch for monitoring patient's vital signs which was described as electric skin The device was created by embedding sensors in a thin film and then placing the film on a polyester backing similar to those found on temporary tattoos A small coil provided power through induction In tests the device stayed in place for 24 hours without adhesives relying instead on the van der Waals force and was flexible enough to move with the skin it was placed on Project researcher John A Rogers commented What we are trying to do here is to really reshape and redefine electronics? The goal is really to blur the distinction between electronics and biological tissue
The team proposed that in addition to monitoring patient health the electronic device could be used to monitor brain waves detect speech by sensing vibrations in the larynx and emit heat to help in healing They suggested that it could perhaps even be made sensitive to touch and be used as artificial skin A number of public and private enterprises provided funding for the project including the Air Force Research Laboratory and the U.S Department of Energy The results of the research was published in Science Rogers founded a company MC10 to explore commercial uses for the skin
2012
In November 2012 Bao's Stanford team developed an electronic skin capable of healing itself by combining a self-healing plastic and nickel a conductive metal Unlike self-healing polymers developed by other researchers their skin did not require high temperature or UV lights to activate The individual plastic molecules of the skin break-apart relatively easily but the bonds also easily reform Cut pieces healed to 75% strength within a few seconds and fully in less than 30 minutes when pressed together at room temperature Additionally the process could be repeated many times ? in experiments the material showed near perfect healing after 50 breaks Other self-healing materials alter their structures in the process and thus can only heal once
In addition to being self-healing the electronic skin was pressure-sensitive and very flexible It was the first material to exhibit all these properties at the same time It was also the first conductive self-healing polymer The e-skin could detect both downward pressure and pressure from bending thus in principle it could detect both the pressure and angle of a normal human handshake Bao's team suggested the material could be useful in prosthetics and to create self-healing wires for electronic devices The research was published in Nature Nanotechnology
2013
In July 2013 a different UC Berkeley team announced they had created an electronic skin that lights up when touched Pressure triggered a reaction in the skin that lights up blue green red and yellow LEDs as pressure increased the lights got brighter The material was composed of synthetic rubber and plastic and was thinner than a piece of paper Sandwiched between layers organic LEDs were lit by semiconductor-enriched carbon nanotubes and a conductive silver ink The skin was made up of hundreds of circuits each of which contained a pressure sensor a transistor and a tiny LED Pressure changed the resistance of the sensor thereby changing the amount of electricity flowing into the LED
The Berkley team suggested the invention could be useful in artificial skin for prosthetic limbs attached to human skin to monitor health and used in robotics The invention was announced in Nature Materials Previously flexible sensors and flexible displays had been demonstrated but never at the same time


Tarquinia National Museum

The Tarquinia National Museum is an archaeological museum dedicated to the Etruscan civilization in Tarquinia Italy Its collection consists primarily of the artifacts which were excavated from the Necropolis of Monterozzi to the east of the city It is housed in the Palazzo Vitelleschi
History
The Palazzo Vitelleschi was built between 1436 and 1439 for the cardinal of Corneto the former name of Tarquinia After the cardinal's death the palace was used as stopover for the popes Over time the Soderini family became its new owner and it was turned into a hotel In 1900 it was acquired by the city of Tarquinia which donated it to the Italian state in 1916 The state intended to use the palace for the current museum which opened in 1924 It was the result of the merger of the Municipal Collection and the private collection of the counts Bruschi-Falgari Over the time the collection was enriched by the numerous finds from the ancient city of Tarquinia and the Necropolis of Monterozzi
Collection
The Palazzo Vitelleschi has three floors On the ground floor the sarcophagi and other stone artifacts from the middle of the fourth century BC are exhibited in chronological order The most notable sarcophagi which belonged to the most important Tarquinian families are seen in the tenth room Some of these were carved from Greek marble
The first floor shows the pottery in chronological order starting with the Villanovan culture Both the native Etruscan type of pottery called bucchero and imported pottery is on display here Pottery dated to the Orientalizing period and onward was imported from Ancient Egypt Phoenicia and Ancient Greece Especially pottery from Corinth was imported in large quantities from the end of the seventh to the sixth century BC and imitated by the Etruscans Some bronze tableware also dates to the Orientalizing period After this comes the Attic black-figure and red-figure pottery from the fourth century BC the Classical period A collection of Etruscan bronze coins is exhibited in the ballroom In the same room are later gold coins from the Roman Empire which were found at Gravisca Tarquinia's ancient harbor and gold jewelry The first floor ends with a collection of votive offerings
The second floor is a square porch which offers a view over the city and the countryside This floor houses some of the restored paintings from the tombs of the Necropolis of Monterozzi The tombs are the Tomb of the Triclinium the Tomb of the Bigas the Tomb of the Olympic Games and the Tomb of the Ship In the hall of weapons the Cavalli Alati are exhibited a relief of a pair of winged horses They once decorated the Ara della Regina an Etruscan temple in Tarquinia which dates to the fourth century BC

In 2007 Bishara fled Israel and resigned from the Knesset after being questioned by police on suspicion of aiding and passing information to the enemy during wartime contacts with a foreign agent and receiving large sums of money transferred from abroad Bishara has denied the accusations In February 2011 the Israeli parliament passed the so-called ÅgBishara billÅh and later voted to strip Bishara of his parliamentary benefits including his pension of NIS 7,228 per month he received as former Knesset member
Bishara has written extensively on various topics He currently is the General Director of the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies in Doha Qatar and a member of its Executive Board He is a citizen of Qatar in Israel he is considered a wanted fugitive
Life
Early life and education
Bishara was born in Nazareth into a Roman Catholic lower-middle-class family His mother was a teacher and his father a health inspector and trade unionist with connections to the Communist party His younger brother is Marwan Bishara According to The Guardian the family's history goes back hundreds of years to a village north of Nazareth Bishara attended Nazareth Baptist school where he established the first National Committee of Arab High School Students becoming its chairman in 1974
He studied at Haifa University and at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem where in 1976 he founded and headed the Arab Student Union In the same year he was instrumental in setting up the Arab Student Committees and Campus Lands Defense Committee against the occupation of the Israeli-occupied territories At the time he was a member of the Israeli Communist Party Rakah now part of Hadash and supported an Internationalist-Marxist political agenda
Career
Academic career
Upon completing his PhD in philosophy at Humboldt University of Berlin then East Germany in 1986 he joined the faculty of Bir Zeit University and went on to head the Philosophy and Cultural Studies Department for two years from 1994 to 1996 He has also worked as a senior researcher at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute
He is one of the founders of the Society for Arab Culture and of Muwatin the Palestinian Institute for the Study of Democracy founded by a group of scholars and academics in 1992 He also serves on the Board of Trustees of the Arab Democracy Foundation
Bishara is presently the General Director of the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies in Doha Qatar also known as the Doha Institute and a member of its Executive Board According to an article in the Financial Times of May 2013 which claims that Bishara has become something of a court intellectual in Doha he is an adviser to Qatar's emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani who since resigned and his successor former crown prince Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad
Political career
In 1995 Bishara was at the head of a group of young Israeli Palestinian intellectuals who founded the political party National Democratic Assembly Brit Le'umit Demokratit in Hebrew short Balad In 1996 he was elected to the fourteenth Knesset first seating 17 June 1996 on the Balad-Hadash list
Bishara was the first Arab citizen of Israel to run for Prime Minister in the 1999 election but dropped out of the race two days before election day In the end only Ehud Barak and Benyamin Netanyahu were left as final candidates with Barak emerging victorious
In 2003 the Israeli Supreme Court overturned Central Elections Committee decisions to disqualify MKs Ahmad Tibi and Azmi Bishara and Bishara's party Balad from running in the elections to the 16th Knesset The CEC's decision was supported by Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein who went so far as to submit his own petition to the CEC against the party and its leader The CEC ruled that Bishara and Balad sought to destroy the Jewish character of the state and supported the armed struggle against it
Visits to Syria
Bishara visited Syria in 2001 and gave a speech at a memorial ceremony for Syrian President Hafez al-Assad where he was accused of expressed support for Hezbollah Upon his return to Israel he was indicted and charged with incitement to violence and support for a terrorist organization as defined by Israel's Prevention of Terror Ordinance
Bishara again visited Syria in September 2006 where he warned of the possibility that Israel launch a preliminary offensive in more than one place in a bid to overcome the internal crisis in the country and in an attempt to restore its deterrence capability He and members of his party also visited Lebanon where they told the Lebanese prime minister that Hizbullah's resistance to Israel has lifted the spirit of the Arab people Soon thereafter at Interior Minister Roni Bar-On's request Attorney General Menachem Mazuz ordered a criminal investigation be opened against Balad MKs Azmi Bashara Jamal Zahalka and Wassel Taha over their recent visit to Syria as fter Bashara's last trip in 2001 the Knesset passed a law forbidding MKs from visiting any enemy state
Resignation from Knesset
On 22 April 2007 Bishara resigned from the Knesset via the Israeli Embassy in Cairo following a police investigation into his foreign contacts and accusations of allegedly aiding the enemy during wartime passing information on to the enemy and contacts with a foreign agent as well as laundering money received from foreign sources Bishara has denied the allegations and has stated that he is staying abroad because he believes he wouldn't receive a fair trial
Following a petition by Haaretz and other media outlets to lift a gag order preventing publication of information relating to the specific charges being laid against Azmi Bishara on 2 May 2007 the Petah Tikva Magistrate's Court announced the gag order would be fully lifted One week prior the court had allowed only for the fact that Bishara is suspected of assisting the enemy in wartime transmitting information to the enemy contact with a foreign agent and money-laundering to be publicized
Bishara is accused of giving Hizbullah information on strategic locations in Israel that should be attacked with rockets during the 2006 Lebanon War in exchange for huge amounts of money Wiretaps were authorized by the Israeli High Court of Justice Investigators say that Bishara recommended long-range rocket attacks which would serve Hizbullah's cause
According to court documents Bishara was questioned twice in the case and during the last encounter he told interrogators that he intends to leave Israel for a couple of days He said he would attend a third questioning session soon upon his return to Israel
Bishara addressed a rally of supporters in Nazareth via telephone in April 2007 He told the thousands of supporters that My guilt is that I love my homeland our intellect and our words are our weapons Never in my life did I draw a gun or kill anyone
Said Nafa Bishara's replacement in the Knesset commented on the charges leading up to Bishara's resignation saying There were many instances in which the Shin Bet tried to set people up They're just trying to behead a prominent Arab leader They will fail
On 14 February 2011 Bishara's pension as a former Knesset member was canceled through a new law The law was specially written to handle his case
Syrian revolt
According to the Financial Times Bishara has been involved in the formation of the Syrian National Coalition the main Syrian opposition umbrella group which is supported by Qatar as an adviser to Qatar's then emir and crown prince who has succeeded his father in late June 2013 In July 2011 Bishara reportedly said that Assad could have stayed in power had he made the reforms people wanted writing The regime chose not to change and so the people will change it
Personal life
Bishara is married and has two children According to The Jerusalem Post he received a kidney transplant in March 1997 at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem According to his website he is a citizen of Qatar


Glycoprotein Ib-IX-V Receptor Complex

The GPIb-IX-V complex is a profuse membrane receptor complex originating in megakaryocytes and exclusively functional on the surface of platelets It primarily functions to mediate the first critical step in platelet adhesion by facilitating binding to von Willebrand factor vWF on damaged sub-endothelium under conditions of high fluid shear stress Although the primary ligand for the GPIb-V-IX receptor is vWF it can also bind to a number of other ligands in the circulation such as thrombin P-selectin factor XI factor XII high molecular weight kininogen as well as bacteria GPIb-IX-V offers a critical role in thrombosis metastasis and the life cycle of platelets and is implicated in a number of thrombotic pathological processes such as stroke or myocardial infarction
Molecular structure
Overview
GPIb-IX-V consists of four different subunits namely GPIbÉø Molecular weight MW 135 kDa GPIbÉ¿ MW 26 kDa GPIX MW 20 kDa and GPV MW 82kDa The complex is assembled such that GPIbÉø GPIbÉ¿ and GPIX form a highly integrated protein complex in a 1:2:1 stoichiometry and this associates weakly with GPV resulting in an overall stoichiometric ratio of 1:1
Each subunit of the complex is a type I transmembrane TM protein which consists of a leucine-rich repeat LRR ectodomain extracellular domain a single transmembrane helix and a relatively short cytoplasmic tail that lacks enzymatic activity
The quaternary stabilization of the receptor is facilitated by covalent and non-covalent interactions The GPIbÉø subunit is linked to two GPIbÉ¿ subunits via membrane-proximal disulfide bonds while GPIX associates itself tightly through non-covalent interactions with GPIb The concomitant expression of all three subunits is required to allow the effective expression of GPIb-IX on the platelet cell surface and analysis of receptor expression in transfected Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells has further supported that the interaction between these subunits also acts to stabilize them
Each of the four subunits GPIbÉø GPIbÉ¿ GPIX and GPV is part of the leucine rich repeat motif superfamily These leucine rich repeat sequences tend to be about 24 amino acids in length either occurring singly or in tandem repeats flanked by conserved N-terminal and C-terminal disulfide loop structures Nevertheless even though these structural similarities exist distinctive genes that exist on different chromosomes of the genome code for the polypeptides that make up the GPIb-V-IX complex
The four genes that code for the components of the receptor in humans have a simple organization in which the coding sequence is contained within a single exon This is with the exception of the gene for GPIbÉ¿ which contains an intron 10 bases following the start codon
Human GPIbÉø is the product of a gene on chromosome 17 specifically 17p12 GPIbÉ¿ is the product of a gene on chromosome 22 specifically 22q11.2 while GPV and GPIX are products of genes found on chromosome 3 specifically 3q21 and 3q29 respectively Under normal conditions all four molecules are expressed exclusively in the platelet lineage GPIbÉø GPIbÉ¿ and GPIX are necessary for the effective biosynthesis of the receptor and are closely associated at the platelet membrane Typically a lack of a single subunit significantly decreases the surface expression of the entire receptor complex
GPIbÉø
GPIbÉø consisting of 610 amino acids is the major subunit and contains all known extracellular ligand-binding sites of the complex for example the A1 domain of von Willebrand factor vWF has a binding region as marked in the N-terminal domain of GPIbÉø while the thrombin binding site is contained in a conformationally flexible acidic residue-rich sequence containing sulfated tyrosines
Dissection of the crystal structure of the GPIbÉø N-terminal leucine rich repeat domain discloses the presence of a single disulfide bond between cysteine Cys residues Cys4 and Cys17 in the N-capping region and two disulfide bonds Cys209-Cys248 and Cys211-Cys264 in the C-capping region Furthermore there are seven tandem leucine rich repeats and their flanking sequences in the central parallel É¿-coil region This parallel É¿-coil region is made up of three sided coils stacked in layers and contains two asparagine residues Asn21 and Asn159 which serve as N-glycosylation sites Following the leucine rich repeat domain is the acidic residue-rich sequence containing sulfated tyrosines the highly O-glycosylated macroglycopeptide a stalk region of about 40 to 50 residues a single transmembrane sequence and finally a cytoplasmic tail containing 96 amino acid residues which includes serine residues such as Ser587 Ser590 and Ser609 that can be phosphorylated
GPIbÉ¿ GPIX GPV
GPIbÉ¿ contains 181 amino acids In the extracellular domain ectodomain both the N-capping and C-capping regions which flank the leucine rich repeat sequence contain two interlocking disulfide bonds Furthermore there is only a single leucine-rich repeat giving rise to a much less curved parallel É¿-coil region as compared to that in GPIbÉø GPIbÉ¿ contains only one N-glycosylation site Asn41 and is disulfide linked to GPIbÉø immediately proximal to the plasma membrane of the platelet via Cys122 located at the junction of the extracellular and transmembrane domains
The GPIbÉ¿ cytoplasmic domain has a sequence of 34 amino acids The region adjacent to the membrane is enriched in basic residues and Ser166 found more distally is phosphorylated and appears to have a role in platelet cytoskeletal rearrangement GPIX contains 160 amino acids The extracellular domain which also only has a single leucine rich repeat sequence shares more than 45% sequence identity with GPIbÉ¿ counterpart However the transmembrane and cytoplasmic sequences are considerably different The GPIX cytoplasmic tail is short consisting of 8 residues and is not known to associate with intracellular proteins There is also a cysteine residue Cys154 located at the junction of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains The extracellular domain of GPV contains 13 leucine rich repeats flanked by N- and C- capping regions both containing two interlocking disulfide bonds This is followed by a stalk region the transmembrane sequence and a short cytoplasmic tail rich in basic residues
The GPV subunit is only weakly associated with the GPIb-IX part of the receptor complex through interactions between the transmembrane domains and has little impact on the surface expression of GPIb-IX although GPIb-IX is required for efficient expression of GPV Furthermore GPV doesnÅft appear to be critical for vWF binding or signal transduction
Role in disease
Abnormalities of the GPIb-V-IX complex result in abnormal appearance and functioning of platelets resulting in Bernard-Soulier syndrome BSS a condition first described by Bernard J and Soulier J.P It is a rare hereditary bleeding disorder most commonly with an autosomal recessive inheritance and diagnosed based on prolonged skin-bleeding time a reduced number of very large platelets macrothrombocytopenia and defective ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination
Bernard Soulier Syndrome is characterized by little or no expression of GPIb-IX on the surface of platelets which in turn has the same effect on GPV There have been a number of mutations associated with BSS patients that have been mapped to GPIbÉø GPIbÉ¿ and GPIX demonstrating that all three subunits are required for effective surface expression of the complex on platelets

Bajar dengan Djiwa

Bajar dengan Djiwa Perfected Spelling Bayar dengan Jiwa Indonesian for Pay with One's Soul is a now-lost 1941 film from the Dutch East Indies modern day Indonesia Directed by R Hu and produced by Ang Hock Liem it starred A Bakar Djoewariah O Parma Oedjang RS Fatimah Soelastri and Zonder The story centers on two families torn apart by finances and clashes of personality
The third film produced by Union Films Bajar dengan Djiwa featured many actors who had previously appeared in the company's works It was released by February 1941 Advertisements emphasised the realism of the story and reviewers praised the film's acting romance and humour Screenings continued until at least 1943 more than a year after Union was closed following the Japanese occupation
Plot
Bajar dengan Djiwa follows the interactions of several groups of people Husband and wife Basuki Zonder and Suryati Nji Soelastri clash because of their different personalities the former is a thinker concerned with the state of society while the latter only thinks of herself Meanwhile Umar Oedjang and Supini RS Fatimah clash over Umar's wasteful nature eventually he sinks so far into debt that he must sell his daughter Djuliah Djoewariah to a loan shark named Asnan O Parma a move which breaks the heart of Djuliah's boyfriend Ruhiyat A Bakar Other scenes include comic interactions between two servants Icah Ijem and Djemblug Komung
Production
Bajar dengan Djiwa was directed by R Hu for Union Films It was Hu's second film for the company he had already completed one film for the company Harta Berdarah Bloody Treasure 1941 in collaboration with Rd Ariffien The film Union's third was produced by its head Ang Hock Liem The story was written by journalist Saeroen who had joined Union with Harta Berdarah after previously finding success with Tan's Film
This black-and-white film starred A Bakar Djoewariah O Parma Oedjang RS Fatimah Soelastri and Zonder It also included Itjang Ali Haroen Oesman Komoeng Ijem and Moesa Many of these actors including Soelastri and Fatimah had been with Union since its first production Kedok Ketawa The Laughing Mask in 1940 Others including Moesa and Zonder had made their debuts in Harta Berdarah Djoewariah a stage actress and keroncong singer was a new hire
Release and reception
Bajar dengan Djiwa produced in 1940 was released by February 1941 By July 1941 the film was being screened in Singapore then part of British Malaya A novelisation of the film written by Saeroen was published by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning In the East Indies children under age 17 were prohibited from viewing Advertisements some which referred to the film with the Dutch title Met den Dood Betaald emphasised the film's realistic depiction of a married life
A review in the Java Bode found that Bajar dengan Djiwa was one of the Best Malay films yet made with almost no stiffness and woodenness in the acting Another review in the Nieuws van den Dag voor Nederlandsch-Indie described the film as striking proof of Saeroen's knowledge of indigenous society and praised the film's romance and humour
Legacy

Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom

The Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom abbreviated as #MCPIF is an internet law bill filed in the Philippine legislature The bill contains provisions promoting civil and political rights and Constitutional guarantees for Philippine internet users such as freedom of expression as well as provisions on information and communications technology policy ICT4D internet governance e-governance cybersecurity cyberwarfare cyberterrorism and cybercrime
The Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom was proposed as an alternative to the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 whose enactment was met with mixed reactions Proponents of the bill claim that the #MCPIF is the first crowdsourced bill in the Philippines
Background
In response to the signing into law by President Benigno S Aquino III of Republic Act No 10175 a group of Filipino lawyers bloggers technology experts and human rights advocates called Democracy.Net.PH spearheaded a crowdsourcing initiative towards the drafting of a law intended to replace it The proposed Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom was then filed as Senate Bill No 3327 by Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago on November 12 2012 The bill remained pending in committee until the 15th Congress adjourned on June 6 2013
In the 16th Congress Senator Santiago re-filed the Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom in the Senate as Senate Bill No 53 on July 1 2013 On July 4 2013 Representative Kimi Cojuangco of the 5th District of Pangasinan filed a counterpart bill in the House of Representatives as House Bill No 1086 On July 24 2013 Senator Paolo Benigno Bam Aquino IV filed a version of the #MCPIF enhanced with a Free WiFi provision as Senate Bill No 1091
The bill has passed first reading in both chambers of the Philippine legislature
Provisions
The bill is divided into ten parts and contains 85 sections
Reactions
The Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom has been generally viewed locally and internationally as a welcome development in promoting civil and political rights on the internet Columnist Conrado de Quiros of the Philippine Daily Inquirer acknowledged Senator Defensor-Santiago writing ÅgMiriam in fact may not just have done the netizens?in great part the youth?a favor she may just have done government a favor.Åh Jillian York Director for International Freedom of Expression of the Electronic Frontier Foundation commented that ÅgOverall the crowdsourced Act is a success story and we support our allies in the Philippines as they work to push it forward in the Senate.Åh Criticism about the possibility of double jeopardy for libel which was one of the bases for the constitutional challenges made against the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 was later clarified by the billÅfs proponents Women's rights advocate and Manila Standard Today columnist Elizabeth Angsioco commented after an apparent attack on the online version of the newspaper I am reminded of the bill Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom and its provisions pertaining to peopleÅfs rights online freedom of expression strengthening ICT infrastructures and cyber crimes With these cyberattacks against MST I am more convinced that Congress should pass MCPIF The Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility took note that Section 4 of the #MCPIF protects and promotes freedom of speech and expression on the Internet and protects the right of the people to petition the government via the Internet for redress of grievances and that Section 52 defines provisions and exceptions on Internet libel highlighting that the #MCPIF states that expressions of protest against and dissatisfaction with the government shall not constitute Internet libel The Sunlight Foundation also noted that the Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom among other things strengthens the right of free expression aspires towards universal internet access and protects usersÅf privacy


Literature in early modern Scotland

Literature in early modern Scotland is literature written in Scotland or by Scottish writers between the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century and the beginnings of the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution in mid-eighteenth century By the beginning of this era Gaelic had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language confined to the Highlands and Islands The tradition of Classic Gaelic Poetry survived longer in Scotland than in Ireland Gaelic was gradually being overtaken by Middle Scots which became the language of both the nobility and the majority population The establishment of a printing press under royal patent in 1507 would begin to make it easier to disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity
James IV's creation of a Renaissance court included the patronage of poets or makars who were mainly clerics These included Robert Henryson William Dunbar and Gavin Douglas whose Eneados 1513 was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglian language James V supported William Stewart and John Bellenden and David Lyndsay George Buchanan had a major influence as a Latin poet founding a tradition of neo-Latin poetry In the reign of Mary Queen of Scots and the minority of her son James VI cultural pursuits were limited by the lack of a royal court and by political turmoil The Kirk heavily influenced by Calvinism also discouraged poetry that was not devotional in nature Nevertheless poets from this period included Richard Maitland of Lethington John Rolland Alexander Hume and Alexander Scott In the 1580s and 1590s James VI promoted the literature of the country of his birth in Scots He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians later called the Castalian Band which included William Fowler John Stewart of Baldynneis and Alexander Montgomerie Later poets that followed in this vein included William Alexander Alexander Craig and Robert Ayton David Lyndsay's The Thrie Estaitis 1540 is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation Buchanan was major influence on Continental theatre but his impact in Scotland was limited by his choice of Latin as a medium Isolated plays from this period include the anonymous The Maner of the Cyring of ane Play before 1568 and Philotus published in London in 1603 The same system of professional companies of players and theatres that developed in England in this period was absent in Scotland
The loss of the court as a centre of patronage in 1603 was a major blow to Scottish literature After his accession to the English throne James VI increasingly favoured the language of southern England A number of Scottish poets including William Alexander John Murray and Robert Aytoun accompanied the king to London where they continued to write but they began to anglicise their written language As the tradition of classical Gaelic poetry declined a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge often undertaken by women such as Mary MacLeod of Harris The tradition of neo-Latin poetry reached its fruition with the publication of the anthology of the Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum 1637 This period was marked by the work of the first named female Scottish poets such as Elizabeth Melville whose Ane Godlie Dream 1603 was the first book published by a woman in Scotland This was the period when the ballad emerged as a significant written form in Scotland From the seventeenth century they were used as a literary form by aristocratic authors including Robert Sempill Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw and Lady Grizel Baillie
After the Union in 1707 and the shift of political power to England the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education Allan Ramsay was the most important literary figure of the era often described as leading a vernacular revival He laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature led the trend for pastoral poetry and his pastoral opera The Gentle Shepherd was one of the most influential works of the era He would also play a leading role in supporting drama in Scotland and the attempt to found a permanent theatre in the capital Ramsay was part of a community of poets working in Scots and English that included William Hamilton of Gilbertfield Robert Crawford Alexander Ross William Hamilton of Bangour Alison Rutherford Cockburn and James Thompson's Tobias Smollett was a poet essayist satirist and playwright but is best known for his picaresque novels for which he is often seen as Scotland's first novelist The early eighteenth century was also a period of innovation in Gaelic vernacular poetry Major figures included Rob Donn Mackay Duncan Ban MacIntyre and Alasdair MacDonald who mixed traditional forms with influences from the Lowlands Drama was pursued by Scottish playwrights in London such as Catherine Trotter David Crawford's and Newburgh Hamilton who wrote the libretto for HandelÅfs Samson 1743 James Thompson and David Mallet also wrote individual plays and collaborated with composer Thomas Arne on the opera Masque of Alfred 1740 with Thompson supplying the lyrics for the patriotic song Rule Britannia In Scotland drama was supplied by visiting English players and actors but there were clashes with the Kirk Ramsay was instrumental in establishing a small theatre in Carruber's Close in Edinburgh but it closed soon after the passing of the 1737 Licensing Act A new theatre was opened at Cannongate in 1747 and operated without a licence into the 1760s
Sixteenth century
Background
By the early modern era Gaelic had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language confined to the Highlands and Islands The tradition of classic Gaelic poetry survived longer in Scotland than in Ireland with the last fully competent member of the MacMhuirich dynasty who were hereditary poets to the Lords of the Isles and then the Donalds of Clanranald still working in the early eighteenth century Nevertheless interest in the sponsorship of panegyric Gaelic poetry was declining among the clan leaders Gaelic was gradually being overtaken by Middle Scots which became the language of both the nobility and the majority population Middle Scots was derived substantially from Old English with Gaelic and French influences It was usually called Inglyshe and was very close to the language spoken in northern England but by the sixteenth century it had established orthographic and literary norms largely independent of those developing in England From the mid sixteenth century written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing Standard English of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England With the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England most writing in Scotland came to be done in the English fashion
The establishment of a printing press under royal patent in 1507 would begin to make it easier to disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity The first Scottish press was established in Southgait in Edinburgh by the merchant Walter Chepman c 1473-c 1528 and the bookseller Andrew Myllar f 1505-08 Although the first press was relatively short lived beside law codes and religious works the press also produced editions of the work of Scottish makars before its demise probably about 1510 The next recorded press was that of Thomas Davidson f 1532-42 the first in a long line of king's printers who also produced editions of works of the makars
Makars
James IV's r 1488-1513 creation of a Renaissance court included the patronage of poets or makars who were mainly clerics These included Robert Henryson c 1450-c 1505 who re-worked Medieval and Classical sources such as Chaucer and Aesop in works such as his Testament of Cresseid and The Morall Fabillis William Dunbar 1460-1513 produced satires lyrics invectives and dream visions that established the vernacular as a flexible medium for poetry of any kind Gavin Douglas 1475-1522 who became Bishop of Dunkeld injected Humanist concerns and classical sources into his poetry The landmark work in the reign of James IV was Douglas's version of Virgil's Aeneid the Eneados It was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglian language finished in 1513 but overshadowed by the disaster at Flodden that brought the reign to an end
As a patron of poets and authors James V r 1513?42 supported William Stewart and John Bellenden who translated the Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Hector Boece into verse and prose David Lyndsay c 1486-1555 diplomat and the head of the Lyon Court was a prolific poet He wrote elegiac narratives romances and satires George Buchanan 1506?82 had a major influence as a Latin poet founding a tradition of neo-Latin poetry that would continue in to the seventeenth century Contributors to this tradition included royal secretary John Maitland 1537?95 reformer Andrew Melville 1545?1622 John Johnston 1570??1611 and David Hume of Godscroft 1558?1629
From the 1550s in the reign of Mary Queen of Scots r 1542?67 and the minority of her son James VI r 1567?1625 cultural pursuits were limited by the lack of a royal court and by political turmoil The Kirk heavily influenced by Calvinism also discouraged poetry that was not devotional in nature Nevertheless poets from this period included Richard Maitland of Lethington 1496-1586 who produced meditative and satirical verses in the style of Dunbar John Rolland fl 1530-75 who wrote allegorical satires in the tradition of Douglas and courtier and minister Alexander Hume c 1556-1609 whose corpus of work includes nature poetry and epistolary verse Alexander Scott's 1520-82/3 use of short verse designed to be sung to music opened the way for the Castalian poets of James VI's adult reign
Unlike many of his predecessors James VI actively despised Gaelic culture However in the 1580s and 1590s he strongly promoted the literature of the country of his birth in Scots His treatise Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody published in 1584 when he was aged 18 was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue to which he applied Renaissance principles He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians later called the Castalian Band which included William Fowler c 1560?1612 John Stewart of Baldynneis c 1545?c 1605 and Alexander Montgomerie c 1550-98 They translated key Renaissance texts and produced poems using French forms including sonnets and short sonnets for narrative nature description satire and meditations on love Later poets that followed in this vein included William Alexander c 1567-1640 Alexander Craig c 1567-1627 and Robert Ayton 1570-1627 By the late 1590s the king's championing of his native Scottish tradition was to some extent diffused by the prospect of inheriting of the English throne
Dramatists
Lyndsay produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace for the king and queen thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540 which satirised the corruption of church and state and which is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation Buchanan was major influence on Continental theatre with plays such as Jepheths and Baptistes which influenced Pierre Corneille and Jean Racine and through them the neo-classical tradition in French drama but his impact in Scotland was limited by his choice of Latin as a medium The anonymous The Maner of the Cyring of ane Play before 1568 and Philotus published in London in 1603 are isolated examples of surviving plays The latter is a vernacular Scots comedy of errors probably designed for court performance for Mary Queen of Scots or James VI The same system of professional companies of players and theatres that developed in England in this period was absent in Scotland but James VI signalled his interest in drama by arranging for a company of English players to erect a playhouse and perform in 1599
Seventeenth century
Poetry
Having extolled the virtues of Scots poesie after his accession to the English throne James VI increasingly favoured the language of southern England In 1611 the Kirk adopted the English Authorised King James Version of the Bible In 1617 interpreters were declared no longer necessary in the port of London because Scots and Englishmen were now not so far different bot ane understandeth ane uther Jenny Wormald describes James as creating a three-tier system with Gaelic at the bottom and English at the top The loss of the court as a centre of patronage in 1603 was a major blow to Scottish literature A number of Scottish poets including William Alexander John Murray and Robert Aytoun accompanied the king to London where they continued to write but they soon began to anglicise their written language James's characteristic role as active literary participant and patron in the English court made him a defining figure for English Renaissance poetry and drama which would reach a pinnacle of achievement in his reign but his patronage for the high style in his own Scottish tradition largely became sidelined The only significant court poet to continue to work in Scotland after the king's departure was William Drummond of Hawthornden 1585?1649
As the tradition of classical Gaelic poetry declined a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge While Classical poetry used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century the vernacular continued to develop In contrast to the Classical tradition which used syllabic metre vernacular poets tended to use stressed metre However they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role as the verse was still often panegyric A number of these vernacular poets were women such as Mary MacLeod of Harris c 1615-1707
The tradition of neo-Latin poetry reached its fruition with the publication of the anthology of the Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum 1637 published in Amsterdam by Arthur Johnston c.1579?1641 and Sir John Scott of Scotstarvet 1585?1670 and containing work by the major Scottish practitioners since Buchanan This period was marked by the work of the first named female Scottish poets Elizabeth Melville's f 1585-1630 Ane Godlie Dream 1603 was a popular religious allegory and the first book published by a woman in Scotland Anna Hume daughter of David Hume of Godscroft adapted Petrarch as Triumphs of Love Chastitie Death 1644
This was the period when the ballad emerged as a significant written form in Scotland Some ballads may date back to the late medieval era and deal with events and people that can be traced back as far as the thirteenth century including Sir Patrick Spens and Thomas the Rhymer but which are not known to have existed until the eighteenth century They were probably composed and transmitted orally and only began to be written down and printed often as broadsides and as part of chapbooks later being recorded and noted in books by collectors including Robert Burns and Walter Scott From the seventeenth century they were used as a literary form by aristocratic authors including Robert Sempill c 1595-c 1665 Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw 1627?1727 and Lady Grizel Baillie 1645?1746
Theatre
The loss of a royal court also meant there was no force to counter the kirk's dislike of theatre which struggled to survive in Scotland However it was not entirely extinguished The kirk used theatre for its own purposes in schools and was slow to suppress popular folk dramas Surviving plays for the period include William Alexander's Monarchicke Tragedies written just before his departure with the king for England in 1603 They were closet dramas designed to be read rather than performed and already indicate Alexander's preference for southern English over the Scots language There were some attempts to revive Scottish drama In 1663 Edinburgh lawyer William Clerke wrote Marciano or the Discovery a play about the restoration of a legitimate dynasty in Florence after many years of civil war It was performed at the Tennis-Court Theatre at Holyrood Palace before the parliamentary high commissioner John Leslie Earl of Rothes Thomas Sydsurf's Tarugo's Wiles or the Coffee House was first performed in London in 1667 and then in Edinburgh the year after and drew on Spanish comedy A relative of Sydsurf physician Archibald Pitcairne 1652?1713 wrote The Assembly or Scotch Reformation 1692 a ribald satire on the morals of the Presbyterian kirk circulating in manuscript but not published until 1722 helping to secure the association between Jacobitism and professional drama that discouraged the creation of professional theatre
Early eighteenth century
Vernacular revival
After the Union in 1707 and the shift of political power to England the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education Nevertheless Scots remained the vernacular of many rural communities and the growing number of urban working-class Scots Literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation Allan Ramsay 1686?1758 was the most important literary figure of the era often described as leading a vernacular revival He laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature publishing The Ever Green 1724 a collection that included many major poetic works of the Stewart period He led the trend for pastoral poetry helping to develop the Habbie stanza which would be later be used by Robert Burns as a poetic form His Tea-Table Miscellany 1724-37 contained poems old Scots folk material his own poems in the folk style and gentilizings of Scots poems in the English neo-classical style His pastoral opera The Gentle Shepherd was one of the most influential works of the era He would also play a leading role in supporting drama in Scotland and the attempt to found a permanent theatre in the capital
Verse and prose
Ramsay was part of a community of poets working in Scots and English These included William Hamilton of Gilbertfield c 1665?1751 Robert Crawford 1695-1733 Alexander Ross 1699-1784 the Jacobite William Hamilton of Bangour 1704?54 socialite Alison Rutherford Cockburn 1712-94 and poet and playwright James Thompson's 1700-48 most famous for the nature poetry of his Seasons Tobias Smollett 1721?71 was a poet essayist satirist and playwright but is best known for his picaresque novels such as The Adventures of Roderick Random 1748 and The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle 1751 for which he is often seen as Scotland's first novelist His work would be a major influence on later novelists such as Thackeray and Dickens
The early eighteenth century was also a period of innovation in Gaelic vernacular poetry Major figures included Rob Donn Mackay 1714-78 and Donnchadh Ban Mac an t-Saoir Duncan Ban MacIntyre 1724?1812 The most significant figure in the tradition was Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair Alasdair MacDonald c 1698?1770 His interest in traditional forms can be seen in his most significant poem Clanranald's Gallery He also mixed these traditions with influences from the Lowlands including Thompson's Seasons which helped inspire a new form of nature poetry in Gaelic which was not focused on their relations to human concerns
Drama
Drama was pursued by Scottish playwrights in London such as Catherine Trotter 1679-1749 born in London to Scottish parents and later moving to Aberdeen Her plays and included the verse-tragedy Fatal Friendship 1698 the comedy Love at a Loss 1700 and the history The Revolution in Sweden 1706 David Crawford's 1665-1726 plays included the Restoration comedies Courtship A-la-Mode 1700 and Love at First Sight 1704 These developed the character of the stage Scot often a clown but cunning and loyal Newburgh Hamilton 1691?1761 born in Ireland of Scottish descent produced the comedies The Petticoat-Ploter 1712 and The Doating Lovers or The Libertine 1715 He later wrote the libretto for HandelÅfs Samson 1743 closely based on John Milton's Samson Agonistes James Thompson's plays often dealt with the contest between public duty and private feelings included Sophonisba 1730 Agamemnon 1738 and Tancrid and Sigismuda 1745 the last of which was an international success David Mallet's c 1705?65 Eurydice 1731 was accused of being a coded Jacobite play and his later work indicates opposition to the Walpole administration The opera Masque of Alfred 1740 was a collaboration between Thompson Mallet and composer Thomas Arne with Thompson supplying the lyrics for the his most famous work the patriotic song Rule Britannia
In Scotland a troop of English players came to Edinburgh in 1715 where they performed Macbeth and a series of Restoration comedies but they soon left perhaps because of objections from local kirk presbyteries By 1725 English actor Anthony Aston a friend of Ramsay was performing in Edinburgh but seems to have fallen foul of the Scottish Master of the Revels who licensed plays companies and playhouses and soon left In 1727 the Kirk attacked theatres as immoral in the Admonition and Exhortation The Edinburgh Company of Players were able to perform in Dundee Montrose Aberdeen and regular performances at the Taylor's Hall in Edinburgh under the protection of a Royal Patent Ramsay was instrumental in establishing them in a small theatre in Carruber's Close in Edinburgh but the passing of the 1737 Licensing Act made their activities illegal and the theatre soon closed A new theatre was opened at Cannongate in 1747 and operated without a licence into the 1760s

Crustacean

Crustaceans Crustacea form a very large group of arthropods usually treated as a subphylum which includes such familiar animals as crabs lobsters crayfish shrimp krill and barnacles
The 67,000 described species range in size from Stygotantulus stocki at to the Japanese spider crab with a leg span of up to and a mass of Like other arthropods crustaceans have an exoskeleton which they moult to grow They are distinguished from other groups of arthropods such as insects myriapods and chelicerates by the possession of biramous two-parted limbs and by the nauplius form of the larvae
Most crustaceans are free-living aquatic animals but some are terrestrial e.g woodlice some are parasitic e.g Rhizocephala fish lice tongue worms and some are sessile e.g barnacles The group has an extensive fossil record reaching back to the Cambrian and includes living fossils such as Triops cancriformis which has existed apparently unchanged since the Triassic period More than 10 million tons of crustaceans are produced by fishery or farming for human consumption the majority of it being shrimp and prawns Krill and copepods are not as widely fished but may be the animals with the greatest biomass on the planet and form a vital part of the food chain The scientific study of crustaceans is known as carcinology alternatively malacostracology crustaceology or crustalogy and a scientist who works in carcinology is a carcinologist
Structure
The body of a crustacean is composed of body segments which are grouped into three regions the cephalon or head the thorax and the pleon or abdomen The head and thorax may be fused together to form a cephalothorax which may be covered by a single large carapace The crustacean body is protected by the hard exoskeleton which must be moulted for the animal to grow The shell around each somite can be divided into a dorsal tergum ventral sternum and a lateral pleuron Various parts of the exoskeleton may be fused together
Each somite or body segment can bear a pair of appendages on the segments of the head these include two pairs of antennae the mandibles and maxillae the thoracic segments bear legs which may be specialised as pereiopods walking legs and maxillipeds feeding legs The abdomen bears pleopods and ends in a telson which bears the anus and is often flanked by uropods to form a tail fan The number and variety of appendages in different crustaceans may be partly responsible for the group's success
Crustacean appendages are typically biramous meaning they are divided into two parts this includes the second pair of antennae but not the first which is usually uniramous the exception being in the Class Malacostraca where the antennules may be generally biramous or even triramous
The main body cavity is an open circulatory system where blood is pumped into the haemocoel by a heart located near the dorsum Malacostraca have haemocyanin as the oxygen-carrying pigment while copepods ostracods barnacles and branchiopods have haemoglobins The alimentary canal consists of a straight tube that often has a gizzard-like gastric mill for grinding food and a pair of digestive glands that absorb food this structure goes in a spiral format Structures that function as kidneys are located near the antennae A brain exists in the form of ganglia close to the antennae and a collection of major ganglia is found below the gut
In many decapods the first and sometimes the second pair of pleopods are specialised in the male for sperm transfer Many terrestrial crustaceans such as the Christmas Island red crab mate seasonally and return to the sea to release the eggs Others such as woodlice lay their eggs on land albeit in damp conditions In most decapods the females retain the eggs until they hatch into free-swimming larvae
Ecology
The majority of crustaceans are aquatic living in either marine or freshwater environments but a few groups have adapted to life on land such as terrestrial crabs terrestrial hermit crabs and woodlice Marine crustaceans are as ubiquitous in the oceans as insects are on land The majority of crustaceans are also motile moving about independently although a few taxonomic units are parasitic and live attached to their hosts including sea lice fish lice whale lice tongue worms and Cymothoa exigua all of which may be referred to as crustacean lice and adult barnacles live a sessile life ? they are attached headfirst to the substrate and cannot move independently Some branchiurans are able to withstand rapid changes of salinity and will also switch hosts from marine to non-marine species Krill are the bottom layer and the most important part of the food chain in Antarctic animal communities Some crustaceans are significant invasive species such as the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis and the Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus
Life cycle
Mating system
The majority of crustaceans have separate sexes and reproduce sexually A small number are hermaphrodites including barnacles remipedes and Cephalocarida Some may even change sex during the course of their life Parthenogenesis is also widespread among crustaceans where viable eggs are produced by a female without needing fertilisation by a male This occurs in many branchiopods some ostracods some isopods and certain higher crustaceans such as the Marmorkrebs crayfish
Eggs
In many groups of crustaceans the fertilised eggs are simply released into the water column while others have developed a number of mechanisms for holding on to the eggs until they are ready to hatch Most decapods carry the eggs attached to the pleopods while peracarids notostracans anostracans and many isopods form a brood pouch from the carapace and thoracic limbs Female Branchiura do not carry eggs in external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks and other objects Most leptostracans and krill carry the eggs between their thoracic limbs some copepods carry their eggs in special thin-walled sacs while others have them attached together in long tangled strings
Larvae
Crustaceans exhibit a number of larval forms of which the earliest and most characteristic is the nauplius This has three pairs of appendages all emerging from the young animal's head and a single naupliar eye In most groups there are further larval stages including the zoea pl zoea or zoeas This name was given to it when naturalists believed it to be a separate species It follows the nauplius stage and precedes the post-larva Zoea larvae swim with their thoracic appendages as opposed to nauplii which use cephalic appendages and megalopa which use abdominal appendages for swimming It often has spikes on its carapace which may assist these small organisms in maintaining directional swimming In many decapods due to their accelerated development the zoea is the first larval stage In some cases the zoea stage is followed by the mysis stage and in others by the megalopa stage depending on the crustacean group involved
Classification
The name crustacean dates from the earliest works to describe the animals including those of Pierre Belon and Guillaume Rondelet but the name was not used by some later authors including Carl Linnaeus who included crustaceans among the Aptera in his The earliest nomenclaturally valid work to use the name Crustacea was Morten Thrane Brunnich's in 1772 although he also included chelicerates in the group
The subphylum Crustacea comprises almost 67,000 described species which is thought to be just to of the total number as the majority of species remain as yet undiscovered Although most crustaceans are small their morphology varies greatly and includes both the largest arthropod in the world ? the Japanese spider crab with a leg span of ? and the smallest the 1-micrometre-long Stygotantulus stocki Despite their diversity of form crustaceans are united by the special larval form known as the nauplius
The exact relationships of the Crustacea to other taxa are not completely settled Studies based on morphology led to the Pancrustacea hypothesis in which Crustacea and Hexapoda insects and allies are sister groups More recent studies using DNA sequences suggest that Crustacea is paraphyletic with the hexapods nested within a larger Pancrustacea clade
Although the classification of crustaceans has been quite variable the system used by Martin and Davis largely supersedes earlier works Mystacocarida and Branchiura here treated as part of Maxillopoda are sometimes treated as their own classes Six classes are usually recognised
Fossil record
Crustaceans have a rich and extensive fossil record which begins with animals such as Canadaspis and Perspicaris from the Middle Cambrian age Burgess Shale Most of the major groups of crustaceans appear in the fossil record before the end of the Cambrian namely the Branchiopoda Maxillopoda including barnacles and tongue worms and Malacostraca there is some debate as to whether or not Cambrian animals assigned to Ostracoda are truly ostracods which would otherwise start in the Ordovician The only classes to appear later are the Cephalocarida which have no fossil record and the Remipedia which were first described from the fossil Tesnusocaris goldichi but do not appear until the Carboniferous Most of the early crustaceans are rare but fossil crustaceans become abundant from the Carboniferous period onwards
Within the Malacostraca no fossils are known for krill while both Hoplocarida and Phyllopoda contain important groups that are now extinct as well as extant members Hoplocarida mantis shrimp are extant while Aeschronectida are extinct Phyllopoda Canadaspidida are extinct while Leptostraca are extant Cumacea and Isopoda are both known from the Carboniferous as are the first true mantis shrimp In the Decapoda prawns and polychelids appear in the Triassic and shrimp and crabs appear in the Jurassic however the great radiation of crustaceans occurred in the Cretaceous particularly in crabs and may have been driven by the adaptive radiation of their main predators bony fish The first true lobsters also appear in the Cretaceous
Consumption by humans
Many crustaceans are consumed by humans and nearly 10,700,000?tons were produced in 2007 the vast majority of this output is of decapod crustaceans crabs lobsters shrimp and prawns Over 60% by weight of all crustaceans caught for consumption are shrimp and prawns and nearly 80% is produced in Asia with China alone producing nearly half the world's total Non-decapod crustaceans are not widely consumed with only 118,000?tons of krill being caught despite krill having one of the greatest biomasses on the planet

Popculturology's Bill Kuchman said Between last weekÅfs episodes and Last Time in New York Season 9 of HIMYM has felt less than a tight storyline and more like a series of vignettes punctuated by heartstring-tugging closing scenes This weekÅfs episode wrapped up with one of my favorite Lily moments in a long time


Michigan Organization for Human Rights

The Michigan Organization for Human Rights MOHR was a Michigan based civil rights and anti-discrimination organization It was founded in 1977 and disbanded in 1994 with most of its assets transferring to the University of Michigan Bentley Historical Library Affirmations LGBT community center of Ferndale and the Triangle Foundation?which replaced MOHR as the state's LGBT civil rights organization today known as Equality Michigan
Activities
Although civil rights for lesbians and gay men were not intended to be the sole focus of the organization an early goal of the organization was to focus on educational materials and legal advice concerning issues surrounding sexual orientation In addition to political work including managing a PAC the organization also hosted LGBT community building events
Political advocacy
Some of MOHR's political accomplishments include several court cases involving the rights of lesbian mothers and the rights of people living with HIV Lobbying of the Michigan legislature resulted in increased funding for AIDS research education and care The organization also lobbied several Michigan municipalities for domestic partnership and non-discrimination ordinances
Education
MOHR utilized radio and cable television as a means of informing the public about issues concerning discrimination based on sexual orientation and about the prevention and treatment of AIDS
Another Voice
In 1973 WDET in Detroit began airing a weekly radio program Gayly Speaking which continued until 1982 when it was replaced with Another Voice a new program produced by MOHR As Detroit's first radio program by for and about gays and gay liberation the program focused on such topics as coming out oppression religion and gays in film theater literature and music Programs included a news and announcement segment and often featured prominent organizations and events such as Gay Pride Week Detroit's Gay Community Center and the Gay Switchboard
Michigan Human Rights Campaign Committee
The Michigan Human Rights Campaign Committee was established in 1985 as a political action committee serving the interest of Michigan's LGBT community The name was changed to Pride PAC in 1995 later to Triangle Pride PAC and is today known as the Equality Michigan Pride PAC
Michigan Organization for Human Rights March
In 1986 Craig Covey and MOHR organized the Michigan Organization for Human Rights March MichiganÅfs first gay and lesbian march in Detroit From 1986-1988 the civil rights march took place down Woodward Avenue followed by a rally at Kennedy Square A party took place at the McGregor Center on the campus of Wayne State University following the rally organized by a small number of dedicated gay and lesbian groups and volunteers In 1989 the Gay and Lesbian civil rights march was moved to the more central location of Lansing to attract statewide participation and political awareness as well as to celebrate the 20th anniversary of New York CityÅfs Stonewall Riots
Michigan Privacy Challenge
One of MOHR's most successful projects from 1988 to 1990 was the Michigan Privacy Challenge a series of lawsuits filed by the organization on behalf of individual plaintiffs that challenged the constitutionality of Michigan's sodomy and gross indecency laws The Wayne County Circuit Court's decision in 1990 supported MOHR's position and was not appealed by the State of Michigan
Michigan Organization for Human Rights v Kelley
Michigan's crime against nature and gross indecency laws was briefly overturned in Wayne County by Michigan Organization for Human Rights v Kelley when MOHR won the case in Michigan's Wayne County Circuit Court on July 9 1990 While the state did not appeal the ruling the laws was upheld in a 10-3 vote by the Michigan Court of Appeals in People v Brashier on December 29 1992 effectively reversing MOHR v Kelly
History
Founding
After a series of meetings of community leaders in Detroit in the summer of 1977 the Michigan Organization for Human Rights MOHR was founded at an organizing conference attended by 50 people and held in Lansing Michigan on October 15 and 16 1977 The mission of the organization was broadly conceived so that it could serve as a resource for the numerous local state and national human rights organizations engaged in efforts to eliminate discrimination
Growth
In its early years MOHR meetings rotated around the state primarily being held in Southeast Michigan In September 1978 a staffed office was established in Detroit and an executive director was hired to guide the organization's lobbying outreach and fundraising efforts By 1979 the funding of a staffed office and time commitments required for MOHR work were causing unforeseen pressures on both the organization and those who directed it The resulting resignation of the first executive director led to the first in a series of reorganizations MOHR's dependence on financial contributions from its constituent organizations proved untenable and by the early 1980s the organization had shifted its primary fundraising efforts to individuals In 1985 the organization hired an Executive Director from Ohio Craig Covey in part because of the large and successful Gay and Lesbian civil rights marches he organized in Columbus?which would be helpful later when the organization organized a gay and lesbian march
Conflicts and closure
While the Michigan Privacy Challenge 1988?90 was helping advance the organization's policy efforts internal problems continued with personality conflicts and disagreements over financial commitments and priorities The latter half of the 1980s included frequent resignations reform proposals and dire predictions from factions of the board of directors These struggles resulted in decreased support from the organization's constituents and funders Decreased supported combined with the founding of new lesbian and gay social and political organizations in Southeast Michigan resulted in the organization being less effective in their political and fundraising efforts After one final reorganization attempt the Michigan Organization for Human Rights disbanded in the spring of 1994
Many of the organization's assets including their offices were transferred to Triangle Foundation today Equality Michigan as the organization added public policy advocacy to their existing anti-violence work Most of their community support efforts became a part of the work of Affirmations the LGBT community center in Ferndale Michigan The archives of MOHR were transferred to the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor Bentley has gone on to house the historical archives of many of Michigan's LGBT organizations including Affirmations Triangle Foundation and Equality Michigan

Dmitry Kabalevsky

Dmitry Borisovich Kabalevsky 14 February 1987 was a Russian composer
He helped to set up the Union of Soviet Composers in Moscow and remained one of its leading figures He was a prolific composer of piano music and chamber music many of his piano works have been performed by Vladimir Horowitz He is probably best known in the West for the Comedians Galop from The Comedians Suite Op 26 and his third piano concerto
Life
Kabalevsky was born in Saint Petersburg His father was a mathematician and encouraged him to study mathematics however in early life he maintained a fascination with the arts and became an accomplished young pianist including a three-year stint as a pianist in silent theatres He also dabbled in poetry and painting In 1925 against his father's wishes he accepted a place at the Moscow Conservatory studying composition under Nikolai Myaskovsky and piano with Alexander Goldenweiser In the same year he joined PROKULL Production Collective of Student Composers a student group affiliated with Moscow Conservatory aimed at bridging the gap between the modernism of the ACM and the utilitarian agitprop music of the RAPM He became a professor at the Moscow Conservatory in 1932
During World War II he wrote many patriotic songs having joined the Communist Party in 1940 and was the editor of Sovetskaya Muzyka for its special six-volume publishing run during the war He also composed and performed many pieces for silent movies and some theatre music
In 1948 when Andrei Zhdanov declared his resolution on the directions that Soviet music should take Kabalevsky was originally on the list of named composers who were the most guilty of formalism however due to his connections with official circles his name was removed Another theory states that Kabalevsky's name was only on the list because of his position in the leadership of the Union of Soviet Composers
In general Kabalevsky was not as adventurous as his contemporaries in terms of harmony and preferred a more conventional diatonicism interlaced with chromaticism and major-minor interplay Unlike fellow composer Sergei Prokofiev he embraced the ideas of socialist realism and his post-war works have been characterized as popular bland and successful though this judgement is attributed to many other composers of the time and some of Kabalevsky's best-known youth works date from this era the Violin Concerto the First Cello Concerto
Perhaps Kabalevsky's most important contribution to the world of music-making is his consistent efforts to connect children to music Not only did he write music specifically directed at bridging the gap between children's technical skills and adult aesthetics but during his lifetime he set up a pilot program of music education in twenty-five Soviet schools Kabalevsky himself taught a class of seven-year-olds for a time teaching them how to listen attentively and put their impressions into words His writings on this subject were published in the United States in 1988 as Music and education a composer writes about musical education
In 1961 Kabalevsky made some stereo recordings conducting his Overture Pathetique Spring and Songs or Morning which were released in the U.S in 1975 on the Westminster Gold label
He was awarded a number of state honors for his musical works including three Stalin Prizes Kabalevsky had become quite a force in musical education He was elected the head of the Commission of Musical Esthetic Education of Children in 1962 as well as being elected president of the Scientific Council of Educational Esthetics in the Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of the USSR in 1969 Kabalevsky also received the honorary degree of president of the International Society of Musical Education Kabalevsky wrote for all musical genres and was consistently faithful to the ideals of socialist realism In Russia Kabalevsky is most noted for his vocal songs cantatas and operas while overseas he is known for his orchestral music Kabalevsky frequently travelled overseas he was a member of the Soviet Committee for the Defense of Peace as well as a representative for the Promotion of Friendship between the Soviet Union and foreign countries
His notable students included Leo Smit
He died in Moscow on 14 February 1987

Lordship of Batiscan

The Lordship of Batiscan was located on the north shore of the St Lawrence River between the mouth of the Batiscan River and Champlain River in the current administrative area the Mauricie in the province of Quebec Canada Granted in 1639 to Jesuits colonization of the manor began in 1666 after an initial allotments to census in 1665 The territory of the Lordship of Batiscan included 1/2 lieu of frontage on the St Lawrence river between Champlain River and Batiscan by 20 lieues deep Thus the northern boundary of the Lordship exceeded the Saint-Maurice River It was the deepest in the seigneurial system of New France The Lordship of Batiscan became the most populous stronghold Government of Three Rivers at the end of the 17th Century
In the 17th century intensive colonization of the Lordship focuses the lowlands south of the Saint-Narcisse's moraine especially between 1665 and 1674 where the Jesuits agreed 79 concessions In the 18th century the colonization effort involves two major phases from 1705 to 1724 and from 1740 to 1760 Colonization then went back north into the rear stronghold north of the morraine Saint-Narcisse because lots at the foot of morraine were occupied Today this new range of colonization is the current territory of Saint-Stanislas Mauricie Quebec whose civil registers opened in 1727 In the middle of the 18th century the end of French rule the Lordship of Batiscan is displaced population in the manors north of Lake Saint-Pierre or that of Lordship Yamachiche and Lordship of Riviere-du-Loup
History
Concession to Jacques de la Ferte in 1636
On 15 January 1636 the Company of New France has granted to Mr Jacques de la Ferte abbot of St Mary Magdalene of Chateaudun himself a member of the company a fief and lordship of ten lieues in width approximately 32.48?km on the edge of the great St Lawrence river by twenty lieues about 64.96?km deep into the land This vast territory included approximately south face full scope between the River Trois-Rivieres and Batiscan River The depth of this concession was unclear The act of 1639 conceded to the Jesuits a part of this great territory to establish the Lordship of Batiscan
Grant to the Jesuits in 1639
The territory of the Lordship of Batiscan was granted to Jesuits by a deed of 13 March 1639 by their protector in France Sir Jacques de la Ferte priest counselor almoner Meeting of Roy abbot of St Magdalene of Chateaudun cantor and canon of the Sainte Chapelle du Palais Royal in Paris
This concession contract signed in front of Herve Bergeron and Hyerosme Cousin notaries Chatelet Paris stated an area of land that is since Batiscan River till the Champlain River quarter of lieue in confined or fourth lieues in the beyond to enjoy full stronghold faith and homage high middle and low justice and when the said piece of land will be cultivated will be required to give the Fathers said Mr Abbot and his heirs a silver cross value of sixty soil tournaments and twenty years for recognition without Fathers can qu'iceux Estre received his faith and homage to the said fief if deus the said Lord since he can not do that there is nobody in this country to meet for the said Sieur de la Madeleine
Already established in Trois-Rivieres since 1634 the Jesuits were familiar with the territory of Lower Batiscanie especially along the river including the site of Champlain where the Jesuit missionaries met Amerindians who had settled there Obtaining the grant of such lordship the Jesuits had a priori goal of evangelizing the Indians
Busy with their apostolic mission at Trois-Rivieres fearing the Iroquois attacks and lack of resources the Jesuits delayed the operation of the Lordship of Batiscan In 1651 Jesuits made themselves concede Lordship of Cap-de-la-Madeleine which is populated quickly being close to Trois-Rivieres Thus the Jesuits claimed to be entitled to exploit the north bank of the river between the River of Trois-Rivieres and Batiscan However their rights on the territory of the future Lordship of Champlain was returned to the field of Roy by decree in 1663 having not yet been exploited
Given the handover in 1663 of part of their land rights and concessions many small fiefdoms on the north bank of the river the Jesuits found themselves at risk of losing their right to use the lordship of Batiscan In these circumstances the Jesuits mandated PrepCom coadjutor brother Francois Malherbe officially take possession of the manor of Batiscan by signing a deed with the notary Laurent Portal Tax Attorney for the Jesuits to Cap-de-la-Madeleine and marking the territory
The said deed is a reminder of the concession contract of March 13 1639 granted the Jesuits and further defines the territory of the manor The editor of the act says have carried on said place with Mr Saule sic Boivin which in our presence surveyed the said lands and around ycelles cut large trees and bounded by other trees large cross made along iceux with axes And towards the Brother Malherbe made several good acts of possession pulling weeds and throwing stones and finally a true possessor accustomed to And that and everything above it required that we act we granted him to serve him and argue and reason Guillaume de La Rue and Adrien Guillot two citizens of Cape Town were witnesses to the act
In Lower Canada the seigneurial system was abolished December 18 1854
Lordship of Champlain
The Lordship of Champlain related to the west to the Lordship of Batiscan was granted on 8 August 1664 and the new lord Pezard La Touche He has immediately erected a stately mansion located on the tip the mouth of the Champlain River He also built a small chapel to serve several settler families already established in this area The Lord of the designated Latouche Champlain land Estienne Pezard is assigned the rights in 1664 on two areas and 34 blocks of land grants in 1664 and 1665
Earthquake of 1663
According to reports of the terrible earthquake of February 5 1663 Native American and some French were living in the Lordship of Batiscan This earthquake could significantly alter the relief in the Batiscanie Quebec including the disappearance of saults in Batiscan River the emergence of new rocks flattening of some mountains major cracks in the ground

Concessions of lands to the habitants
Valley of Saint-Laurent
In 1665 the Jesuits conceded the first batches of the lands in Batiscan in the first row along the St Lawrence river between the Champlain River and Batiscan River From March 1666 to May 1667 seventy concessions were allocated to pioneers on the north shore of St Lawrence river At the end of the 17th century concessions are granted lands to pioneers back in the Batiscan River on the eastern bank Sometimes the locations of items are assigned or informally occupied at the initiative of pioneers without notarial contract the situation was normalized a few years later by an official contract Several concessions were awarded to ex-soldiers who were exempt from the usual obligations owed to Jesuit lords
Then lots were granted on the banks of the Champlain River the Riviere a la lime and finally in the upper valley of the Riviere a Veillet Veillet River With the expansion of colonization the authorities opened other rows for the colonization moving away from rivers In the lordship of Batiscan three areas suitable for agriculture were the valley near the river the upper valley of the Riviere a Veillet Veillet River and northern morraine
A hamlet was formed around the mouth of the Riviere a Veillet Veillet River to become in the 19th century the village of Sainte-Genevieve-de-Batiscan In 1723 the steward Michel Begon de la Picardiere signed an order authorizing the construction of a church in Sainte-Genevieve-de-Batiscan on a piece of land belonging to Jean Veillet unique ancestor of all Veillet/te of America
Morraine east-west
Settlement to the north stumbled to the great morraine which is a line of mountains stretching from east to west parallel to St Lawrence river usually between 12 and 15?km from the shore This morraine covers current parishes of Saint-Narcisse Saint-Prosper and continues eastward into the Portneuf region The area of the morraine is generally unsuitable for agriculture and enabling logging including the maple The Batiscan river is going down the morraine by preventing falls navigation and requiring a long portage To the east of the Batiscan River colonization is prevented by a large area of swamps and bogs that extends to the Sainte-Anne-de-la-Perade
Sector Riviere des Envies Cravings river
Forced to move north due to lack of available lots new pioneers leave the St Lawrence Valley the valley of the riviere a la lime and the upper valley of the Riviere a Veillet Veillet River They crossed the morraine by the way of porting to settle in the new area known as riviere des Envies The lots are granted successively to the north by the Lords from morraine In 1743 ten concessions are granted by the Lords to the riviere des Envies
In 1781 the Jesuits erected a stately mill near the mouth of the riviere des Envies in Saint-Stanislas At this point the riviere des Envies included arnacher falls more easily than the Batiscan river In 1786 a chapel was built in Saint-Stanislas
From the beginning of British rule colonization deepened gradually up the riviere des Envies In 1833 an early settler stood near Lake Kapibouska Saint-Tite Quebec|Saint-Tite A Catholic mission Saint-Just-de-Kapibouska was established in 1851 and became the nucleus of the future parish of Saint-Tite
Going up the Batiscan River colonization stops at the edge of the Lordship of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Perade or the Manitou Falls located at the boundary between Saint-Adelphe and Saint-Stanislas The seigneurial system ended in 1854 In the 1980s colonization ascend to the north along the Batiscan river after the cadastre of rows in the current territory of the municipality of Saint-Adelphe including rang St-Thomas today in Sainte-Thecle territory
Summary of colonization
From 1666 to 1759 246 acts of concessions have been listed in the Lordship of Batiscan In 1760 the settlement reached 20 km north of the St Lawrence river bank The main periods of awarding concessions by the Lordship of Batiscan were
In sum the award of concessions in the Lordship of Batiscan had two weak periods and three times more intensive


Munstead Wood

Munstead Wood is a Grade I listed house and garden in Munstead Heath Busbridge on the boundary of the town of Godalming in Surrey England south-east of the town centre The garden was created first by garden designer Gertrude Jekyll and became widely known through her books and prolific articles in magazines such as Country Life The Arts and Crafts style house in which Jekyll lived from 1897 to 1932 was designed by architect Edwin Lutyens to complement the garden
Munstead Wood was the first in a series of influential collaborations between Lutyens and Jekyll in house and garden design The number of these collaborations has been put at around 120 other well known ones include Deanery Garden in Berkshire and Hestercombe House in Somerset
The entire original area of Jekyll's property is grade I listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens Since Jekyll's time it has been divided into six plots with different owners
The main house which retains the name of Munstead Wood and whose plot contains most of the original gardens is a grade I listed building The properties in the other plots which are to the north and west of the main house also include listed buildings designed by Lutyens in the lesser two categories these were mostly Jekyll's outbuildings
Garden
Jekyll purchased Munstead Wood in 1882 or 1883 just across Munstead Heath Road from Munstead House where she had been living with her mother since 1878 A part of Munstead Heath Munstead Wood was a triangular area in total sloping upwards from its north-west corner which was a sandy field to of former Scots pine woodland on heath soil
Jekyll transformed Munstead Wood gradually over many years She allowed the felled woodland to grow back but thinned the young trees creating areas of different varieties and different combinations of varieties and gave each area its own underplantings of flowers and shrubs The resulting woodland garden was viewed via a series of long woodland walks Nearer the house the woods merged gradually into lawns Seasonal gardens flowered in succession through the year the spring garden the hidden garden the June garden and the main herbaceous border long which flowered from July until October Each garden displayed carefully arranged shades of colour
Jekyll turned the lower field into a kitchen garden There was also a plant nursery from which she supplied plants to her clients She also bred improved varieties of plants such as Munstead bunch primroses
The garden of Munstead Wood became widely known as a result of Jekyll's descriptions and photographs in her books such as Wood and Garden 1899 Home and Garden 1900 and Colour in the Flower Garden 1908 and in her many articles particularly in Country Life and William Robinson's magazines The Garden and Gardening Illustrated William Robinson was a frequent visitor Jekyll's long relationship with Country Life began when proprietor Edward Hudson first visited Munstead Wood in 1899 Her garden was notably recorded in Country Life in subsequent years by photographer Charles Latham and Herbert Cowley
The gardens attached to the main house have been privately restored Public viewing of the gardens is possible by arrangement
House
At Jekyll's first meeting with Lutyens in 1889 she invited him to Munstead Wood and their collaboration began They explored the local vernacular architecture gathering ideas for the construction of Jekyll's house His first building for her was The Hut a cottage built in the grounds of Munstead Wood in 1895 Jekyll used this as a workshop and lived in it until Lutyens completed the main house in 1897 While the house was still being built Lutyens obtained another larger commission in Surrey Orchards as a result of his future clients being impressed with Munstead Wood when they happened to walk past the construction site Jekyll lived at Munstead Wood until her death in 1932
The house was built in a U-shape around a courtyard open on its north side The west wing contained Jekyll's workshops and to the east lay a service wing On the house's south garden elevation the tiled roof extends down to the top of the ground floor broken by two large gables On the right of this elevation a narrow south-projecting porch wing has an arch the house's main entrance on its east side where this wing forms a continuation of the house's east facade
The house was built of local Bargate stone lined inside with brick The casement windows were set flush with the outside walls to maximise the internal window sills Oak timbers were extensively used These were obtained from local oaks silvered using a treatment with hot lime Other features included a large hooded fireplace and a shallow-stepped staircase leading up to a long oak-beamed gallery overhanging the central courtyard
The other buildings in the north and west of Munstead Wood have become separate properties Besides The Hut these were originally Jekyll's gazebo potting shed gardener's cottage and stables
Cenotaph of Sigismunda
A garden seat built by Lutyens for Jekyll at Munstead Wood consisting of a large block of elm set on stone was christened the Cenotaph of Sigismunda by their friend Charles Liddell Until then Lutyens had not known the term cenotaph meaning empty tomb Jekyll later wrote
The Cenotaph
In 1919 Lloyd George asked Lutyens to design a catafalque to serve as a temporary memorial structure in Whitehall Westminster London Recalling the term he had first heard at Munstead Wood Lutyens proposed that a cenotaph would be more appropriate Lloyd George accepted and this concept was used for the 1919 structure and its permanent replacement in 1920 The Cenotaph which became the principal war memorial of the United Kingdom for World War I and World War II At Munstead Wood only a copy of the original seat remains


Muriel Morley

Muriel Morley OBE 1899 - 1993 was an English speech therapist who worked internationally She was president of the College of Speech Therapists
Early years
Muriel Elizabeth Morley 1899-1993 was born on 20 February 1899 in Halifax Yorkshire She was the eldest daughter of Samuel Edwin Morley and his wife Helen Ann Monk nee Fletcher Morley attended high schools in Halifax and Monkseaton North Tyneside and went on to read physics and biology at Armstrong College a division of the University of Durham located in Newcastle upon Tyne In 1920 she graduated with a BSc and a certificate of education She taught physics at the Church High School in Newcastle for ten years before taking up a teaching post in India Whilst working in India Morley contracted dysentery and upon her return to England she was advised that she was no longer strong enough for work in the classroom
Speech and Language Therapy
In 1932 after working for a period of time as a secretary due to her forced change of career Morley responded to an advertisement placed by William Wardell a plastic surgeon located in Newcastle upon Tyne Wardell had developed a new type of pharyngoplasty for children with cleft palate and wanted an educated woman to assess the speech skills of the children before and after surgery to help determine the effectiveness of the operation Having not ever heard of the profession of speech therapy Morley applied for the post After she was appointed she immediately immersed herself in her new job increasing her knowledge of cleft palate by reading books and articles and learning photography as a useful adjunct to her work The following five years were a turning point for Morley and patients with disorders of speech other than cleft palate were referred to her Realising that she needed to further her knowledge but unable to afford the part-time speech therapy training courses available in London Morley trained as a speech therapist by working with colleagues in Liverpool and London in hospitals and school clinics In 1938 her efforts were rewarded when she gained the diploma of the British Society of Speech Therapists
Now a qualified speech therapist Morley was appointed as a therapist at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne Whilst working for two sessions a week she spent time preparing a thesis on cleft palate which later became the basis for her book Cleft Palate and Speech passed in April 1939 It is around this time that she also gained membership of the British Society of Speech Therapists its members were admitted to the College of Speech Therapists founded in 1945 later she would become its President in 1971 and the editor of its academic journal Morley's book gave thorough descriptions of the anatomy of cleft palate surgery associated speech problems and practical suggestions for treatment It became a source of standard work in this field when published in 1945
Between 1940 and 1945 people were becoming increasingly aware of speech therapy and the profession gained more recognition By 1945 Morley had set up Newcastle's hospital speech therapy service and was now working full-time as a therapist in three different hospitals Her treatment covered a variety of speech language and communication disorders including aphasic ex-servicemen suffering from head injuries sustained in World War II As Morley's practice expanded she was obliged to involve parents in the treatment of their child's speech and language disorder to manager her bulging caseload However soon she recognised the benefits of this and became an exponent of parental involvement in speech therapy
Research
One of her major studies with colleagues in Child Health Neurology and Statistics was conducted between 1950 and 1953 During this time Morley's department researched into the normal and abnormal development of speech in a group of over 1000 children at ages 2,4,6 and 15 as part of the Newcastle Thousand Families survey In 1957 she published part of this study together with examples of her work in multidisciplinary clinics as The Development and Disorders of Speech in Childhood This work was regarded as a landmark in speech pathology in the United States of America In 1958 on the basis of this book Morley was awarded the degree of DSc by the University of Durham
Morley made her first of several visits to the USA in 1951 where she found the standard of clinical work was below that of the UK but that academically the training was more extensive Upon her return to the UK Morley hoped that a university degree course might persuade more people into the profession Eventually she persuaded the university in Newcastle still then part of the University of Durham to investigate the possibility of setting up a degree In 1959 Morley's idea was realised and she delayed her retirement in order to establish the course She was appointed lecturer in speech and speech pathology in the departments of child health and education founding head of what became the first department of Speech in Britain
Bill for Professions Supplementary to Medicine 1959
Not content with the work she had already done Morley became involved in the 1959 Bill for Professions Supplementary to Medicine The Government and Opposition of the day decided to bring a number of disciplines of which speech therapy was one under this Bill Instantly seeing the threat which this offered to the youthful profession Morley with representatives from the College of Speech Therapists called on the responsible minster and told him that speech therapy could not be described as supplementary to any other profession and that academic study in this field was vital for the service of people with speech and language disorders A national referendum of speech therapists followed the profession stood firm and despite government anger they were removed from the Bill The Professions Supplementary to Medicine Bill was enacted in 1960
Retirement
Morley's contribution to the profession of speech therapy was considerable She eventually retired from what was by then the University of Newcastle upon Tyne however in retirement she founding editor of the College of Speech Therapists journal from 1966 - 1971 and served as its third president from 1971 - 1973 Throughout her career she forged strong links with speech therapy profession in the USA Australia and New Zealand where she travelled widely as a visiting professor She was involved in achieving reciprocal recognition of speech therapy qualifications in the USA and was made an honorary member of the American Cleft Palate Association and honorary fellow of the Australian College of Speech Therapists
In 1980 Morley was appointed OBE in acknowledgement of her pioneering work in research and education in speech therapy Donald Court professor of child health at Newcastle and her former colleague described Morley in 1984 as a remarkable woman likening her to Cromwell's soldiers she knew what she fought for and loved what she knew
During her retirement Morley lived in Northumberland where she enjoyed the last thirty years of her life The photography that she learned as part of her original cleft palate work remained a lifelong hobby Morley never married but was described as being devoted to her family She died of bronchopneumonia on 15 September 1993 in Alnwick Northumberland


Material inference

In logic inference is the process of deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true In checking a logical inference for formal and material validity the meaning of only its logical vocabulary and of both its logical and extra-logical vocabulary
is considered respectively
Examples
For example the inference Socrates is a human and each human must eventually die therefore Socrates must eventually die is a formally valid inference it remains valid if the nonlogical vocabulary Socrates is human and must eventually die is arbitrarily but consistently replaced
In contrast the inference Montreal is north of New York therefore New York is south of Montreal is materially valid only its validity relies on the extra-logical relations is north of and is south of being converse to each other
Material inferences vs enthymemes
Classical formal logic considers the above north/south inference as an enthymeme that is as an incomplete inference it can be made formally valid by supplementing the tacitly used conversity relationship explicitly Montreal is north of New York and whenever a location x is north of a location y then y is south of x therefore New York is south of Montreal
In contrast the notion of a material inference has been developed by Wilfrid Sellars in order to emphasize his view that such supplements are not necessary to obtain a correct argument
Non-monotonic inference
Robert Brandom adopted Sellars view arguing that everyday practical reasoning is usually non-monotonic i.e additional premises can turn a practically valid inference into an invalid one e.g
Therefore practically valid inference is different from formally valid inference which is monotonic - the above argument that Socrates must eventually die cannot be challenged by whatever additional information and should better be modelled by materially valid inference While a classical logician could add a ceteris paribus clause to 1 to make it usable in formally valid inferences
However Brandom doubts that the meaning of such a clause can be made explicit and prefers to consider it as a hint to non-monotony rather than a miracle drug to establish monotony
Moreover the match example shows that a typical everyday inference can hardly be ever made formally complete In a similar way Lewis Carroll's dialogue What the Tortoise Said to Achilles demonstrates that the attempt to make every inference fully complete can lead to an infinite regression

Mava Lee Thomas

Mava Lee Thomas ÅåÅåTommieÅåÅå September 1 1929 ? August 6 2013 was an infielder and catcher who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League She was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed
Born in Ocala Florida Mava Lee Thomas was the only player in AAGPBL history whose father played in Major League Baseball Her father Herb Thomas was a center fielder/second baseman for the Boston Braves and New York Giants in parts of three seasons spanning 1924?1927
In the fourth grade Thomas learned her baseball skills from her father who taught her the importance of competition practice adversity and teamwork ÅåÅåTommieÅåÅå as her father dubbed her attended several schools while growing up in Florida because Mr Thomas worked as a coach and scout for the Giants organization She heard about the AAGPBL while attending Ocala High School where she played for the VFW team
The AAGPBL operated from 1943 to 1954 and gave over 600 women athletes the opportunity to play professional baseball and to play it at a level never before attained The league was conceived by Philip K Wrigley during World War II under the idea of initiating the innovative project to maintain interest in baseball as the military draft was depleting major-league rosters of first-line players and attendance declined at ballparks around the country
After graduating from school Thomas attended an AAGPBL tryout at Fort Wayne Indiana The switch-hitter made the grade and joined the Fort Wayne Daisies for the 1951 season Thomas earned $75 per week plus expenses with the Daisies which was a considerable amount of money in those days even though the girls played six nights a week and a doubleheader on Sundays She was mostly used as a backup for Mary Rountree C and Jean Weaver 3B
At the end of the season Thomas became concerned that poor attendance indicated an uncertain future for the league Then she was determined to continue playing ball and went into the US Navy to play in the female softball team serving also as a member of the Armed Forces Recreation Society After discharge in 1953 she played exhibition games for the Hagerstown Mollies of Maryland during two years She got married in 1953 but the marriage lasted only two years
Thomas also finished a degree in recreation at the University of Florida and went to work for the Ocala Parks and Recreation Department in 1984 helping to establish such events as Light Up Ocala and the annual fishing derby at Tuscawilla Park before retiring in 1995
In 1988 Thomas received further recognition when she became part of Women in Baseball a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown New York which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League In addition Thomas and her father became the only father/daughter combination to be inducted into the Florida Baseball Hall of Fame
The AAGPBL folded in 1954 Lady pitchers catchers and fielders drifted into obscurity until 1992 when the film A League of Their Own was released The film kindled a renewed interest in these trailblazers who have their own places in American history While the film does not use real names filmmaker Penny Marshall seemed to be aiming for realism as her work includes fake newsreel footage and pseudo-documentary present day scenes at the beginning and end of the fictitious story Since then Thomas and her teammates have become the darlings of the media They have been honored several times for their significant contributions responding to request for autographs and corresponding with young athletes interested in hearing of their days in the AAGPBL
Thomas felt proud to be the only girl ball player with a major league father She remembered him into playing an old-timers game in 1988 when he was 87 year old He had spike scars on his arm from Ty Cobb she explained in an interview
Tommie Thomas died in 2013 in her homeland of Ocala Florida at the age of 83 following complication from Alzheimer's disease


Marriage card game

ÅgMarriageÅh is a matching card game played with three decks of cards 156 Cards played in Nepal Bhutan and Nepali diaspora throughout the world It is originally thought to have evolved from Rummy and is based on making sets of three or more matching cards of the same rank Trials of the same rank and suit Tunnels or of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit Sequences
General Features
Sets
A set is a group of three or more cards A set can contain
1 Three or more consecutive cards of the same suit which is called a Åg"Sequence".Åh
2 Three or Four cards of the same rank but each of a different suit which is called a Åg"Trial"Åh or a Åg"Quartile"Åh
3 Three cards of the same rank and suit which is referred to as a Åg"Tunnel"Åh
Deal
The game uses three standard decks with a variable numbers of optional Wildcard Jokers shuffled within Each player is dealt a hand of twenty one cards each and the remaining cards are kept face down to form the stock The top card from the stock is faced up as the ÅgOffered CardÅh to start the game This card also marks the beginning of the Åg"discard pile"Åh which builds up as the game progresses
The Objective(s
The objective of the game is to arrange all twenty one cards into sets that contain a minimum of three cards each The first three sets Primary Sets need to be pure sets i.e they cannot include wildcards Cards that can be placed as substitutes for any suit or rank The later sets can be arranged using Wildcards and Jokers The first player to completely arrange his hand of cards into sets ends the round
The Play
The person to the right of the dealer is the first to play He can either choose to pick up the top card from the deck or the offered card He then discards a card from his hand that he does not need which serves as the offered card to the player next to him This continues until a player completes the first three sets Primary Sets with a minimum of three cards each at least nine cards total and displays them face up on the floor Upon discarding an unwanted card the player has the option to select a random card face down from the deck and place it at the bottom of the deck This card for the rest of the round serves as the ÅgMain WildcardÅh The player can now arrange the remaining cards in his hand into more sets with the use of wildcards The important part is that a player gets to see and use the wildcard in his sets only after completing the primary sets and displaying them on the floor The game ends when a player arranges his hand into complete sets with or without the use of wildcards and displays it on the floor for others to see
Wildcards
Wildcards are cards that can be used as replacements for any of the cards of the deck There are two basic categories of wildcards viz Cash Cards and Non-Cash Wildcards
1 Cash Cards
a Main Cash Card The card that is randomly selected by the player who makes the first three sets of cards and is placed at the bottom of the stock is the primary cash card In addition to its value as a wildcard it also has a score value of three points Excluding this card there are two more of the same card in the game as there are three decks of cards used
b Adjacent Cash Cards The two cards of the same suit as the main cash card that follow and precede it in rank are the adjacent cash cards They have a score value of two points each and also serve as wildcards These cards amount to a total six in number two in each deck of cards
c Alternate Cash Card The card of the same rank as the main cash card and a similarly colored suit is the alternate cash card and has a score value of five points each and also serve as wildcards
d Jokers Jokers serve as wildcards as well as cash cards with a score value of five points each if they are included in the game
2 Non-Cash Wildcards All cards of the same rank as the main cash card are wildcards without score values They can help complete sets to finish the game but do not contribute to scoring
An example to illustrate the above system is as follows
If the randomly selected card is the seven of Hearts the other two sevens of Hearts would be the main cash cards The sixes and eights of Hearts total six cards would be adjacent cash cards and the three sevens of Diamonds would be alternate cash cards All other sevens Clubs and Spades would be Non-cash Wildcards
In each round there are eleven cash cards excluding the jokers and six other non-cash wildcards Some variants of marriage do not include the alternate cash card and it serves as a non-cash wildcard like the other six cards that are the same rank as the main cash card
Scoring
When a player completely arranges his hand of cards into sets containing a minimum of three cards each the round is over and a new deal follows Scoring in Marriage is a little complicated and involves calculating the total number of ÅgpointsÅh in the game Points are contributed by wildcards scoring three two or five depending on the type of cash-card At the end of a round each player separates his cash cards from the rest and totals them The grand total is the net score of all of the playersÅf cash-card scores or ÅgpointsÅh Each player wins points based on the number of points he has in his hand regardless of who completes the game
Rules / Exceptions to Scoring
One cannot create a set out of three cards when two are the same rank & suit and a third card is the same rank but a different suit The cards have to be either all different suits but the same rank or they have to form a tunnel three cards of same suit and rank Also wild cards cannot be used as substitutes to help form a tunnel after the primary sets are displayed
A tunnel after the primary deal in oneÅfs hand is worth five points but it has to be displayed before a player picks a card from the stock pile or else it worth no points and only serves as one of the three primary sets
If a player has the main cash card and both cash cards preceding and following it the combination is called a marriage and it is worth ten points
Two cards of two points worth score five in combination and three cards of two value score ten points in combination
Two cards of three points score eight in combination
Two cards of five points each score fifteen in combination and all three cards of the same rank and value of five each score twenty-five points in combination
A player does not have to have the cards in a set to score just having them in his hand as part of different sets or otherwise is enough to score
A tunnel at the beginning of a hand scores five points if the cash card is the same rank as the tunnel the value doubles If the card forming a tunnel is the alternate cash card the score value of the Alternate Tunnel is Thirty Points and if the adjacent cash cards make a tunnel the score value is fifteen points
Variations
Some variations of Marriage include Åg"Murder"Åh where a player that does not display the primary sets forfeits all his cash cards and he has to pay every other player for his worth of cash cards and Åg"Kidnap"Åh where the player who completes the game wins the cards of all players that have not yet displayed the primary sets including their cash cards
Similarly there is another variation also named as dhoos A player is made dhoos if he is found cheating while playing the game and in most of the places he/she is made to pay all the player a sum of money equal to the total transaction carried out in that game

Mike and Sulley are visiting Monsters University for the weekend to see how their Oozma Kappa fraternity brothers are doing The group is throwing its first party but no one has shown up However Mike and Sulley have a plan to liven up the house Using a borrowed door station they sneak into a party at the Roar Omega Roar fraternity and steal all of its food and guests to fill the Oozma Kappa house The supply runs take them through the closet doors of a married couple's bedroom repeatedly disturbing their sleep
Once they have the party fully stocked Scott Squishy Squibbles mother Sherri walks in on it while doing a load of laundry She is angry with the fraternity but only because they did not invite her After lighting a bonfire on the lawn Sherri introduces the crowd to door jamming or jumping from the roof with the help of two doors to land safely on the lawn The guests congratulate the Oozma Kappas all eager to pledge to their fraternity
In a post-credits scene the husband and wife wake their son Timmy up and ask if they can sleep with him saying that there are monsters in their closet Their son vehemently replies That's what I've been trying to tell you
Production notes
According to the short's writer/director Kelsey Mann When you first meet the Oozma Kappas they go to their fraternity house and the first thing they say is Welcome to Party Central We havenÅft thrown a party yet but when we do weÅfll be ready,'...I kept telling I really want to see their party We have to do it in the credits or something Then when the idea of doing a short came up we were like That could be the party The short took around eight months to make voices were recorded near the end of production of Monsters University Mann stated We would do a couple of pickup lines with Billy Crystal and the other actors for the movie and then weÅfd get the stuff we needed for the short Party Central was initially considered as a bonus feature for the Monsters University DVD but the decision was later made to release the short theatrically It was originally scheduled to accompany the theatrical release of Pixar's The Good Dinosaur until the film was shifted from 2014 to 2015
Release
Party Central first premiered August 9 2013 at the D23 Expo in Anaheim California and was shown with the theatrical release of Muppets Most Wanted on March 21 2014 Unlike the two feature-length Monsters Inc films which are both rated G by the MPAA Party Central received a PG rating from the MPAA for some reckless behavior Thus it is the first Pixar short to receive a PG rating from the MPAA unlike all of the previously-released theatrical Pixar shorts which were rated G by the MPAA and also the second Disney animated short film to have been designated that rating after 1990's Roller Coaster Rabbit

Critical reception
After being screened at the D23 Expo BigScreen Animation noted judging from Twitter the response was tremendous Newsday said It starts with a simple plot idea and escalates in classic comedy form Rotoscopers wrote This short film was a cool funny idea Not a story It was literally a sequence of jokes with no emotional core whatsoever

Leo Arons

Martin Leo Arons February 15 1860 - October 10 1919 was a German physicist and social democratic politician He was the namesake of the Lex Arons a law which disallowed members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany SPD to teach at Prussian universities
Life and work
Leo Arons came from a wealthy Jewish banking family in Berlin His parents were Albert Arons 1826-1897 a partner in the prestigious private banking house Gebruder Arons and Clara Goldschmidt 1837-1867 In 1887 Leo Arons married Johanna Bleichroder 1861-1938 a daughter of the banker Julius Bleichroder 1828-1907 Arons brother the banker Paul Arons 1861-1932 married Johanna's sister Gertrude 1865-1917 a few years later
After taking his Abitur Leo Arons studied chemistry and physics earning a doctorate degree in Strasbourg in 1888 As a scientist he worked in the area of experimental physics He developed the mercury vapor lamp also called Arons tube which was later marketed by AEG as Dr Arons mercury vapor lamp In 1890 he became a Privatdozent at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universitat Berlin now Humboldt University of Berlin A year later he became the First Assistant in the Physics department but resigned from this position in 1893 After that he again worked as a Privatdozent
Via the land reform movement Arons came into contact with the SPD which he joined in the early 1890s after some hesitation As a member of the bourgeoisie he had particular reservations about the class struggle advocated by the party The party's commitment to achieve its goals through legal means facilitated his entry He subsequently wrote several articles for the party press Within the party he was on the reformists side He demanded the SPD's participation in the Prussian state elections and became an expert on the Prussian three-class franchise system Since the 1890s he also attempted to unite middle-class social reformers and social democrats by organizing regular informal meetings the Schmalzstullenclub Lard Bread Club He was a leading participant in the organization of the SPD's campaign for the general election of 1903 The press sometimes referred to him as the Chief of Staff of the party for the election campaign From 1904 to 1914 Arons was a member of the Berlin City Council His candidacy for the post of alderman failed however Besides the party Arons also supported free trade unions and the building association Ideal founded in 1907
Arons financed the first union hall in Berlin from his own assets and small apartments for workers in conjunction with Ideal From 1908 he increasingly withdrew from political life due to health reasons
He was a representative in the Berlin district of Neukolln where the Aronsstrase was named after him in 1973 called Leo-Arons-Strase from 1926 and 1934 and Sackfuhrerdamm from 1934 to 1973
Lex Arons
Soon after Arons became a member of the Social Democratic Party Prussian authorities sought to remove him from his teaching post The university department responsible for carrying out this procedure objected to this request several times A majority of the conservative members defended the autonomy of the university against state regulations Their argument was that university teachers were free in their political beliefs and also that a Privatdozent was not subject to state discipline As Arons spoke at the Social Democratic Party's congress in 1897 Kaiser Wilhelm II said I will not tolerate Socialists as the teachers of our youth at the Royal universities
This royal declaration pressured the Prussian government and the reluctant official responsible for higher education Friedrich Althoff to bring about a solution Since the government had no right to directly intervene in the appointment of lecturers a law was passed in 1898 that made a lecturer subject to state disciplinary authority Since this law was tailored especially for Arons case it is called the Lex Arons This law was one of the attempts in the 1890s to prevent the further advancement of the Social Democrats with exceptional laws The Lex Arons was only one of these laws that passed the parliamentary hurdle of the Prussian House of Representatives the Revolution Bill 1894 and the Jail Bill 1899 failed to find majorities in the Reichstag Arons was suspended on the basis of the Lex Arons Due to fear of clashes with the concerned departments Arons was the only case in which the law was used
In public and especially in the scientific community the law sparked debates about the freedom of science Immediately after the November Revolution Arons was rehabilitated by the new government shortly before his death


Somebody Loves You Nik Kershaw song

Somebody Loves You is a song from English singer-songwriter Nik Kershaw It was released as the lead single from Kershaw's fifth studio album 15 Minutes in 1999
Background
Following a decline in Kershaw's commercial success starting in 1986 the 1989 album The Works failed to achieve much commercial success and Kershaw fed up of the lifestyle as a pop star retreated into doing production and writing for other artists including writing the UK number one Chesney Hawkes song The One and Only The album 15 Minutes was Kershaw's first release for a decade released in 1999 Somebody Loves You was the first of two singles from the album and whilst the album and the second single failed to enter the UK charts Somebody Loves You peaked at #70 for one single week in February 1999 The album followed in April 1999 It was his first chart entry since the 1989 single One Step Ahead
Somebody Loves You was written and produced by Kershaw who would write most of his material solely Kershaw's reputation was seriously reassessed after the release of the highly acclaimed 15 Minutes and the quality of Somebody Loves You reaffirmed Nik as one of the UK's finest songwriting talents and finally started laying the image of the 80s Nik Kershaw to rest Reinvigorated by the critical acclaim the extensive radio play of the single along with the second single What Do You Think of It So Far and record company demands for more of the same work began in 2000 on the follow-up album To Be Frank which was released in 2001
In the Express of 7 February 1999 an interview with Kershaw by James O'Brian spoke of the song and stated His first single in a decade called Somebody Loves You hits the streets soon and could well propel him back into the charts Kershaw's reply was That doesn't matter overmuch I'm not-doing this for the money I'm doing it because all songwriters want their stuff heard by as many people as possible I feel more protective of this album than anything before Real life started for me when I turned my back on stardom and 15 Minutes is nothing if not real
In a 28 January 1999 interview with Kershaw by Amanda Cagan and Melissa Sprawl the authors noted that Somebody Loves You dealt directly with a concept close to the artist the idea and misconception of stardom Kershaw explained When you're up onstage it feels like there's so much love coming off the audience While it's good to experience that you have to remember it's not for you but something being projected onto you You can enjoy it while it's happening but it's very dangerous if you start believing it
In a 1998 interview by Sven Kardelke for Kuno On Line Kardelke asked Could you please tell us something about the lyrical content of some of your new songs For Somebody Loves You Kershaw stated That's basically about being on stage and being famous It's a negative look on what you get when you are famous and when I was famous I became the person I was playing in publicity You know you walk into a room You didn't have to try too hard Everyone knew who you were It's just the images and pictures for me of that time when I was onstage and saw the faces singing all those songs back to me It was weird And the chorus Somebody Loves You that's really what it feels like There is all this love coming back towards you You have stop and think How much of that is really you You aren't what they think you are
In 3 April 1999 issue of the Billboard magazine an article based on Kershaw by Charles Karel Bouley II noted Kershaw returns May 4 with a collection that aims to be more than a comeback attempt for a faded pop star More accurately it's a sharp chronicle of an artist's experience in becoming a normal person after a bout of fame In fact the lead single is Somebody Loves You which takes a sharp poke at the hollow adoration of stardom Kershaw revealed During the 80s I was Nik Kershaw Pop Star That's what everybody else wanted me to be I tried to play that role It's very difficult to know who you are when all of that is going on When it all finished in 1989 I went through a period of really wondering who I really was because I wasn't a pop stay anymore
Release
The single was released on two different CD issues in the UK via Eagle Records The single used a radio edit"/"single edit of Somebody Loves You which cut the album version by approximately a minute
The main CD release featured two extra tracks a 1999 acoustic version of Kershaw's 1984 hit song Wouldn't It Be Good and a live acoustic version of Kershaw's 1984 hit song The Riddle For the second Part 2 CD single two alternative extra tracks were issued both of which were non-album tracks written and produced by Kershaw The Wrong Man and Woman Both of these CD singles came with the same artwork with an edited/designed photograph of Kershaw similar to the one seen on the 15 Minutes album cover A UK Eagle Records promo CD-R acetate was also issued which featured a custom disc and custom title sleeve
Additionally the song was also issued as a promotional only single in America Released as a Limited Edition CD-Pro the single featured the same track-listing as the Part 2 UK CD single and featured a CD disc picture of Kershaw with glittery holographic glasses and had a custom back picture insert The CD disc picture used the same image of Kershaw as seen on the Japanese promo album cover of 15 Minutes
Following the song's release on the 15 Minutes album and as a single the song has also appeared on the 2005 compilation Then & Now The Very Best of Nik Kershaw the November 2005 2-CD set Your Brace Face which combined both the 15 Minutes album and Kershaw's 2001 album To Be Frank and the March 2006 German Austrian and Swiss compilation The Riddle which featured all of the tracks of the 15 Minutes album and the two acoustic b-sides of the Somebody Loves You single that appeared on the Part 2 CD single
An acoustic version of the song would later appear on Kershaw's solo-acoustic studio album No Frills released in February 2010 The album featured fifteen previously recorded Kershaw-tracks all re-recorded acoustically
Promotion
A music video was created to promote the single Since appearing unofficially on YouTube in November 2007 the video has gained over 170,000 views In 28 January 1999 interview with Kershaw by Amanda Cagan and Melissa Sprawl the article revealed that the video had already been completed by that date
A live TV broadcast of Kershaw performing Somebody Loves You at the MCM Cafe France was broadcast on 20 May 1999 The MCM Cafe Bar and Club in Paris was run by the French cable music channel MCM with a capacity of 500 At the time Kershaw was undertaking a tour to promote the 15 Minutes album where the song was included in the set
Since being performed live during the 15 Minutes tour Kershaw has regularly included the song in the live set of future gigs and concerts Various unofficial audience recordings of the song being performed live in recent years have been uploaded onto YouTube
Critical reception
In the Billboard magazine issue of 17 July 1999 a review of the single was included under the Rock Tracks section of the Singles page Written by Chuck Taylor the review stated The long-lived Nik Kershaw previews his upcoming 15 Minutes opus with this easy-flowing highly melodic tune which he wrote and produced as well as played guitar on Kershaw sounds youthful and up to the minute here capitalizing on a beautiful harmony-enriched chorus moody organs and guitars that guide this track like an instrumental beacon This is a great little tune well-constructed and adeptly delivered It would be mighty nice for modern rock and triple-A to offer this favored artist a slot on the airwaves where listeners are certain to feel nothing but warmth as they're compelled to sing along
In the Hartford Courant of 5 August 1999 featured a review of the album by Dana Tofig In the review Tofig stated The same lyrical and melodic synergy can be found on the beautiful Fiction and the poppy Somebody Loves You which is the first single
In the Express of 7 February 1999 an interview with Kershaw by article writer James O'Brian spoke of the song and stated His first single in a decade an anthem to the power of affection called Somebody Loves You hits the streets soon and could well propel him back into the charts


Bugby Chapel

Bugby Chapel is an 18th-century former chapel in the centre of Epsom a suburban town in Surrey England Known by this name or Bugby's Chapel in reference to its Calvinistic founder William Bugby it was also known as East Street Chapel and later as it passed into the ownership of different religious groups as Salem Unitarian Chapel Salem Baptist Chapel and the Epsom and District Synagogue More than 200 years of religious use ended when it was converted into an office The chapel is a Grade II Listed building
History
Epsom became a fashionable town in the 18th century popular with businesspeople and wealthy merchants from London who wanted to live in a country town within easy reach of the city Protestant Nonconformism emerged in the town soon after the Act of Uniformity 1662 when covert Presbyterian meetings took place a chapel was built in 1724 and hundreds of worshippers attended It was an era in which congregations frequently split and new churches were formed in accordance with the views of their ministers and such a secession occurred in the 1770s when William Bugby a preacher with strong Calvinistic views came to Epsom He was influenced by the well-known ultra-Calvinist William Huntington who moved to Ewell in 1775 after experiencing a religious conversion and held meetings there Bugby took out certificates for the registration of religious meeting houses in Epsom in 1777 and 1778
In 1779 Bugby bought a plot of land on a narrow lane behind the main London Road and erected a chapel A house later called Rose Cottage was attached to this and there was a burial ground to the northeast William Huntington's name was recorded in the registers there in that year as one of the ministers who had conducted baptisms Bugby was then invited to preach in Brockham near Dorking in 1780 his meetings were successful and a chapel was built in 1783 Like the chapel in Epsom its character was Independent Calvinistic Such worship was closely associated with Surrey in the 18th and 19th centuries other chapels established for preachers with these views include Providence Chapel at Charlwood founded in 1816 From 1783 until his death in 1792 Bugby ministered at both the Epsom and the Brockham chapel He also registered other places of worship in Surrey villages such as Effingham Leigh and Betchworth The nature of worship at the chapel in its early years was not well understood the Anglican vicar of Epsom stated in 1788 that a few years ago a gardener collected money enough to build a small meeting house where he now has a small and uncertain congregation of Methodists they are chiefly people of the lowest class Also at this time the name of the chapel was not fixed Bugby Chapel or Bugby's Chapel were used but East Street Chapel Little Chapel and the Old Huntingtonian Chapel were also recorded
Calvinistic meetings continued at Bugby Chapel until 1825 or 1837 the date at which its baptismal and marriage registers were lodged at Somerset House in London Events later in the 19th century are not clearly documented although in the Government's religious census of 1851 it was recorded as a meeting place for Calvinistic Protestants Attendance was said to be 30 to 40 people and the Handbook of Epsom published in 1860 mentioned that Joseph Irons preacher from a chapel at Camberwell used occasionally to preach there In 1889 the chapel took on a new guise as a Strict Baptist chapel when new trustees were appointed The name Salem Chapel was adopted The 1894 Ordnance Survey map identified it as Salem Unitarian Chapel but it was reconstituted as Strict Baptist in 1896 A new trustees document was produced on 17 August 1899 and thereafter the chapel was identified as Baptist on maps Permanent pastors served between 1923 and 1932 and from 1944 onwards A new chapel was built on the Dorking Road for the congregation in 1951 the very nicely designed and fitted place of worship opened on 30 June 1951 and Bugby Chapel was vacated
After a short period of disuse the chapel came back into religious use in 1954 when it was converted into the Epsom and District Synagogue Hans Leo Lehmann 1907?1992 a German-born chemist moved to Epsom in 1940 and started small-scale meetings for Jewish worship in his house in Woodcote Road in May 1941 Services were later held at a building in Church Street the Lecture Hall of Epsom Congregational Church and the Foresters Hall but in 1954 Lehmann acquired the freehold of the former Bugby Chapel It was reconsecrated as a synagogue in October 1954 by Dr M Lew and local Jews invested their own time and money in converting the building into a synagogue It was registered for worship in accordance with the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855 and was given the Worship Register Number 64502 Membership of the synagogue reached 28 in 1960 but Epsom's Jewish community was always small and the congregation was already in decline when Lehmann?always the leading member and chief organiser of the synagogue?died in 1992 By 1993 there were only 13 members and the congregation decided to join the synagogue in nearby Sutton In 1994 the building was converted into an office with the name The Meeting House
The chapel was designated a Grade II Listed building on 20 May 1975 The adjoining Rose Cottage was no longer associated with the chapel after 1843 when it became a private house and it was demolished in 1978
Architecture
Bugby Chapel is a simple single-storey building in the Classical style The walls are of brick with a later covering of stucco Above the brick cornice the roof is hipped on each of the four sides creating a hidden central valley and is laid with tiles The facade faces south and is of three symmetrical bays with centrally placed panelled double doors below a gabled hood mould This has a tiled roof of its own and is flanked by bargeboards The left and right bays have tall round-arched windows with original metal bars There are similar windows in the north wall and the east wall has two blank windows No original features survive inside The interior dimensions are
Burial ground
There are ten gravestones and monuments in the small burial ground to the east of the chapel The first is a headstone and accompanying footstone neither with any inscription Next is a headstone commemorating Mary Gillam d 1867 and her husband James d 1870 The Swann family?George d 1849 Charlotte d 1874 and Charlotte junior d 1884)?are listed on the next headstone which measures and which has a footstone bearing their initials The next measures and names Ann Snashall nee Inglefield d 1858 two infant children and her father James Inglefield d 1864 Smaller and partly illegible the next gravestone commemorates Elizabeth Sloper d 1846 Thomas Ellis d 1798 is named on a headstone next to which is another measuring headstone which commemorates members of the Humphrey family Mary d 1852 and John d 1866 five children who died between 1820 and 1854 and a grandchild d 1872 On the next headstone William Bugby himself d 1792 is commemorated alongside his wife Mary d 1787 The same Thomas Ellis d 1798 appears again on a pedimented monument of white marble which was taken from the chapel and placed against the east wall it measures Next to this stands a headstone which names Joseph Weller d 1864 his wife Maria d 1859 and their son Joseph junior d 1851 this also has a footstone with their initials

At the same time he worked as an economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development until 1970 which was also the year when he obtained French citizenship Consequently his writings prior to that date were published pseudonymously as Pierre Chaulieu Paul Cardan Jean-Marc Coudray etc
In his 1949 essay The Relations of Production in Russia Castoriadis developed a critique of the supposed socialist character of the government of the Soviet Union The central claim of the Stalinist regime at the time was that the mode of production in Russia was socialist but the mode of distribution was not yet a socialist one since the socialist edification in the country had not yet been completed However according to Castoriadis analysis since the mode of distribution of the social product is inseparable from the mode of production the claim that one can have control over distribution while not having control over production is meaningless
Castoriadis was particularly influential in the turn of the intellectual left during the 1950s against the Soviet Union because he argued that the Soviet Union was not a communist but rather a bureaucratic capitalist state which contrasted with Western powers mostly by virtue of its centralized power apparatus His work in the OECD substantially helped his analyses
In the latter years of Socialisme ou Barbarie Castoriadis came to reject the Marxist theories of economics and of history especially in an essay on Modern Capitalism and Revolution first published in Socialisme ou Barbarie 1960?61 first English translation in 1963 by Solidarity
Psychoanalyst
When Jacques Lacan's disputes with the International Psychoanalytical Association led to a split and the formation of the Ecole Freudienne de Paris EFP in 1964 Castoriadis became a member as a non-practitioner
In 1968 Castoriadis married Piera Aulagnier a French psychoanalyst who had undergone psychoanalytic treatment under Jacques Lacan from 1955 until 1961
In 1969 Castoriadis and Aulagnier split from the EFP to join the Quatrieme Groupe a psychoanalytic group that claims to follow principles and methods that have opened up a third way between Lacanianism and the standards of the International Psychoanalytical Association
Castoriadis began to practice analysis in 1973 he had undergone analysis in the 1960s first with Irene Roubleff and then later with Michel Renard
In his 1975 work L'institution imaginaire de la societe Imaginary Institution of Society and in Les carrefours du labyrinthe Crossroads in the Labyrinth published in 1978 Castoriadis began to develop his distinctive understanding of historical change as the emergence of irrecoverable otherness that must always be socially instituted and named in order to be recognized Otherness emerges in part from the activity of the psyche itself Creating external social institutions that give stable form to what Castoriadis terms the magma of social significations allows the psyche to create stable figures for the self and to ignore the constant emergence of mental indeterminacy and alterity
For Castoriadis self-examination as in the ancient Greek tradition could draw upon the resources of modern psychoanalysis Autonomous individuals?the essence of an autonomous society?must continuously examine themselves and engage in critical reflection He writes
Castoriadis was not calling for every individual to undergo psychoanalysis per se Rather by reforming education and political systems individuals would be increasingly capable of critical self- and social reflexion He offers if psychoanalytic practice has a political meaning it is solely to the extent that it tries as far as it possibly can to render the individual autonomous that is to say lucid concerning her desire and concerning reality and responsible for her acts holding herself accountable for what she does
Sovietologist
In his 1980 Facing the War text he took the view that Russia had become the primary world military power To sustain this in the context of the visible economic inferiority of the Soviet Union in the civilian sector he proposed that the society may no longer be dominated by the party-state bureaucracy but by a stratocracy"?a separate and dominant military sector with expansionist designs on the world He further argued that this meant there was no internal class dynamic which could lead to social revolution within Russian society and that change could only occur through foreign intervention
Later life
In 1980 he joined the faculty of the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales
In 1984 Castoriadis and Aulagnier divorced
He died on December 26 1997 from complications following heart surgery He was survived by Zoe his wife his daughter Sparta by an earlier relationship with Jeanine Rilka Walter Comrade Victorine in the Fourth International and Kyveli a younger daughter from his marriage with Zoe
Thought
Edgar Morin proposed that Castoriadis work will be remembered for its remarkable continuity and coherence as well as for its extraordinary breadth which was encyclopaedic in the original Greek sense for it offered us a paideia or education that brought full circle our cycle of otherwise compartmentalized knowledge in the arts and sciences Castoriadis wrote essays on mathematics physics biology anthropology psychoanalysis linguistics society economics politics philosophy and art
One of Castoriadis many important contributions to social theory was the idea that social change involves radical discontinuities that cannot be understood in terms of any determinate causes or presented as a sequence of events Change emerges through the social imaginary without determinations but in order to be socially recognized must be instituted as revolution Any knowledge of society and social change Ågcan exist only by referring to or by positing singular entitiesÅcwhich figure and presentify social imaginary significations.Åh
Castoriadis used traditional terms as much as possible though consistently redefining them Further some of his terminology changed throughout the later part of his career with the terms gaining greater consistency but breaking from their traditional meaning neologisms When reading Castoriadis it is helpful to understand what he means by the terms he uses since he does not redefine the terms in every piece where he employs them Here are a few
Autonomy and heteronomy
The concept of autonomy appears to be a key theme in his early postwar writings and he continued to elaborate on its meaning applications and limits until his death gaining him the title of Philosopher of Autonomy The word itself is Greek where auto- means for/by itself and nomos means law defining the condition of creating one's own laws whether as an individual or as a whole society Castoriadis noticed that while all societies construct their own unique laws and institutions members of autonomous societies are fully aware of this fact and explicitly self-institute In contrast members of heteronomous societies hetero"- other delegate this process to extra-social authorities and attribute their imaginaries to gods or ancestors or in modern ideologies to historical necessity
Castoriadis emphasized the need of societies to legitimize their laws or explain in other words why their laws are good and just as they claim them to be Most traditional societies did that through religion believing that their laws were given by a super-natural ancestor or god and therefore must be true Modern capitalist societies legitimize their system capitalism through reason claiming it makes logical sense Castoriadis observes that nearly all such efforts are tautological in that they legitimize a system through rules defined by the system itself So just like the Old Testament and the Koran claim that There is only one God God capitalism first defines logic as the maximization of utility and minimization of cost and then bases its own legitimacy on its effectiveness to meet this criterion
As he explains in one of his lectures in the Greek village of Leonidio in 1984 many newly founded societies start from an autonomous state which is usually in the form of direct democracy like the town hall meetings during the American Revolution and the local assemblies of the Paris Commune What they end up with however is a form of governance by which the citizens do not legislate directly but delegate this power to a group of experts who remain in power largely unchecked by official means for a number of years The ancient Greeks on the other hand developed a system of continuous autonomy where the people demos voted constantly on matters of government and law and where the elected rulers the archons were mainly asked to enforce them In such a system courts of law were governed by common citizens who were appointed to the degree of judge briefly and army generals were voted in by the people and had to convince them of the correctness of their decisions Taking some poetic licence to expand this point he says that in this system the president of the national treasury could have been a Phoenician slave since he would only be asked to implement the rulings of the demos
Castoriadis writings delve at length into the philosophy and politics of the ancient Greeks who as a true autonomous society knew that laws are man-made and legitimization tautological They challenged these laws on a constant basis and yet obeyed them to the same degree even to the extent of enforcing capital punishment proving that autonomous societies can indeed exist
The Imaginary
This term originates in the writings of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan see the Imaginary and is strongly associated with Castoriadis work To understand it better we might think of its usual context the imaginary institution of societies By that Castoriadis means that societies together with their laws and legalizations are founded upon a basic conception of the world and man's place in it Traditional societies had elaborate imaginaries expressed through various creation myths by which they explained how the world came to be and how it is sustained Capitalism did away with this mythic imaginary by replacing it with what it claims to be pure reason as examined above That same imaginary is interestingly enough the foundation of its opposing ideology Communism By that measure he observes first in his main criticism of Marxism titled the Imaginary Institution of Society as well as speaking in Brussels that these two systems are more closely related than was previously thought since they share the same industrial revolution type imaginary that of a rational society where man's welfare is materially measurable and infinitely improvable through the expansion of industries and advancements in science In this respect Marx failed to understand that technology is not as he claimed the main drive of social change since we have historical examples where societies possessing near identical technologies formed very different relations to them An example given in the book is France and England during the industrial revolution with the second being much more liberal than the first
Similarly in the issue of ecology he observes that the problems facing our environment are only present within the capitalist imaginary that values the continuous expansion of industries Trying to solve it by changing or managing these industries better might fail since it essentially acknowledges this imaginary as real thus perpetuating the problem
Thus imaginaries are directly responsible for all aspects of culture The Greeks had an imaginary by which the world stems from Chaos and the ancient Jews an imaginary by which the world stems from the will of a pre-existing entity God The former developed therefore a system of immediate democracy where the laws where ever changing according the people's will while the second a theocratic system according to which man is in an eternal quest to understand and enforce the will of God
Castoriadis also believed that the complex historical processes through which new imaginaries are born are not directly quantifiable by science This is because it is through the imaginaries themselves that the categories upon which science is applied are created In the second part of his Imaginary Institution of Society he gives the example of set theory which is at the basis of formal logic which cannot function without having first defined the elements which are to be assigned to sets This initial separation schema de separation É–É‘?É Éø É—ÉÕÉ“ É‘É÷ÉœÉ«É–É ÉÕ? of the world into distinct elements and categories therefore precedes the application of Logic and consequently science
Chaos
This is a concept that one encounters frequently in Castoriadis work in all the references above for example According to that the Greeks developed an imaginary by which the world is a product of Chaos as narrated by both Homer and Hesiod The word has since been promoted to a scientific term but Castoriadis is inclined to believe that although the Greeks had sometimes expressed Chaos in that way as a system too complex to be understood they mainly referred to it as nothingness He then concludes what made the ancient Greek society different to other societies is exactly that core imaginary which essentially says that if the world is created out of nothing then man can indeed in his brief time on earth model it as he sees fit without trying to conform on some pre-existing order like a divine law He contrasted that sharply to the Biblical imaginary which sustains all Judaic societies to this day according to which in the beginning of the world there was a God a willing entity and man's position therefore is to understand that Will and act accordingly
The Ancient Greeks and the Modern West
Castoriadis views the political organization of the ancient Greek city states as a model of an autonomous society He argues that their direct democracy was not based as many assume in the existence of slaves and/or the geography of Greece which forced the creation of small city states since many other societies had these preconditions but did not create democratic systems Same goes for colonisation since the neighbouring Phoenicians who had a similar expansion in the Mediterranean were monarchical till their end During this time of colonisation however around the time of Homer's Epic poems we observe for the first time that the Greeks instead of transferring their mother city's social system to the newly established colony they for the first time in known history legislate anew from the ground up What also made the Greeks special was the fact that following above they kept this system as a perpetual autonomy which led to direct democracy
This phenomenon of autonomy is again present in the emergence of the states of northern Italy during the Renaissance again as a product of small independent merchants
He sees a tension in the modern West between on the one hand the potentials for autonomy and creativity and the proliferation of open societies and on the other hand the spirit-crushing force of capitalism These are respectively characterized as the capitalist imaginary and the creative imaginary
He argues that in the last two centuries ideas about autonomy again come to the fore This extraordinary profusion reaches a sort of pinnacle during the two centuries stretching between 1750 and 1950 This is a very specific period because of the very great density of cultural creation but also because of its very strong
subversiveness
Lasting influence
Castoriadis has influenced European especially continental thought in important ways His interventions in sociological and political theory have resulted in some of the most well-known writing to emerge from the continent especially in the figure of Jurgen Habermas who often can be seen to be writing against Castoriadis Hans Joas published a number of articles in American journals in order to highlight the importance of Castoriadis work to a North American sociological audience and Johann P Arnason has been of enduring importance both for his critical engagement with Castoriadis thought and for his sustained efforts to introduce it to the English speaking public especially during his editorship of the journal Thesis Eleven In the last few years there has been growing interest in CastoriadisÅfs thought including the publication of two monographs authored by Arnason's former students Jeff Klooger's Castoriadis Psyche Society Autonomy Brill and Suzi Adams's Castoriadis's Ontology Being and Creation Fordham University Press

Medalists reactions
Van Dijk lived up the expectations as main favourite and won the time trial by dominating the race
I'm super happy It's difficult to describe how I feel now she said after the race I'm so excited because I dreamt so long of this one and the pressure was high to finish it off It's great to have won My intention was to start fast but I wanted to keep going a bit longer than I did I maybe got over excited and a went too fast but I maintained the time difference and so it was all ok This race was the seasons main goal for Van Dijk She had been tested on her time trial position during the season and found a better position which she was able to maintain for almost half an hour Van Dijk told she practiced the course twice in August at 5:00am to avoid traffic and made video recordings of the course to get to know the turns She had watched the video over and over again until she could dream it
Villumsen rode the New Zealand National Time Trial Championships in January before backing off until June She rode the Giro Rosa and won La Route de France and the time trial at the Tour Cycliste Feminin International de l'Ardeche before heading to World Championships It was a different year for me but a good year She said in an interview I started late and with a different approach I trained more at home and then did race after race I enjoyed it I was still there on the podium so I can thank my team for helping me this far Villumsen a former a Danish national road race champion switched her nationality in 2010 from Danish to New Zealandish It was her fifth straight podium at the world championships in the time trial She took her first bronze in 2009 2010 and 2012 and won silver in her former home county in 2011 It's not bad luck Villumsen said If someone is better they deserve to win Ellen van Dijk has been riding very well all throughout the year she has won all kinds of time trials short ones long ones She really deserved to win A place on the podium is still nice I go close every year but something is missing I'll try to work it out and go all the way to the top perhaps next year
Small American national time trial champions considered retirement in 2012 before signing by She won her first medal at the World Championships
ÅgIÅfm pretty surprised I didnÅft expect to actually podium I thought top five would be a really good ride for me Jim Miller USA Cycling vice president of athletics and I met before and I really wanted Jim in the car talking to me because he was in the car at Nationals with me when I won I just buried myself in the last 500 meters I knew it was going to hurt but it hurts for everyone With 100 meters to go I wanted to quit but I did one more click down on my gears and I just counted the pedal strokes to get me to the finish This hurt worse than IÅfve ever hurt before She also felt sorry for Evelyn Stevens who missed a place on the podium by 0.04 seconds It's a very bittersweet feeling for me Evelyn is a good friend a teammate and a fellow countryman We've spent a lot of time together this season and it's hard to have been beaten and have it be so close

Briddlesford Nature Reserve

Briddlesford Nature Reserve or Briddlesford Woods Nature Reserve consists of 158 hectares ~390 acres of land on the Isle of Wight that is composed of a complex of different habitats including woodland arable farmland lowland meadow parkland pond hedgerow and grazing marsh The reserve encompasses a majority of the Briddlesford Copses Site of Special Scientific Interest SSSI and Special Area of Conservation SAC together with about 50 hectares ~124 acres of farmland The reserve is owned by People's Trust for Endangered Species PTES and managed to preserve and enhance its biodiversity value
Flora
Woodland flora
A vegetation survey of the woodland complex was undertaken in 2007 and concluded that
The woodland complex has a superb representation of the range of communities making up the lowland mixed Atlantic bluebell woods Floristically this survey demonstrated the woodland flora is among the richest in England for woodland vascular plants
A total of 65 Ancient Woodland Indicator plants have been recorded in the wood
Of special note is the population of narrow-leaved lungwort Pulmonaria longifolia This nationally scarce species is the rarest known vascular plant on the reserve and in Britain is limited to ancient woodlands on the shores and tributaries of the Solent Other locally distributed ancient woodland specialities include green hellebore Helleborus viridis greater butterfly orchid Platanthera chlorantha and thin spiked wood sedge Carex strigosa
Fauna
Mammals
Briddlesford Copses?the woodland areas that make up the majority of the woodland in the reserve?were designated a SAC in 1995 in recognition of the internationally important breeding population of Bechstein's bats that are resident there The rare barbastelle bat also breeds in the woods contributing to a total of eight bat species recorded at the site These animals are particularly associated with woodpecker holes and crevices in mature ash trees at this site The woods support both hazel dormice and red squirrels and alongside the bats form a mammal assemblage that is unique to the UK The dormice have been monitored in the woodland since at least 1996 Over 530 nest boxes are arranged in two grids that contribute data to the National Dormouse Monitoring Programme NDMP and inform the management of the woodlands
Invertebrates
The invertebrate fauna of the reserve has been surveyed in detail in 2002 and 2012 and surveyors found a rich and diverse fauna with an abundance of ancient woodland associated species A total of 650 species have been identified and the reserve is now known to be of SSSI quality for saproxylic invertebrates dead wood specialists Of special interest is the rare fungus weevil Pseudeuparius sepicola a Red Data Book species The nationally scarce wood-cricket Nemobius sylvestris is very common in Briddlesford Copse and a population of the ash-black slug Limax cinereoniger was also recently discovered at the reserve - the largest terrestrial slug in the world The rides and railway cuttings also provide a valuable habitat for a variety of woodland butterflies including silver-washed fritillary Argynnis paphia white admiral Limenitis camilla and the dark crimson underwing moth Catocala sponsa
Public access
There is a bridleway through the reserve and the parkland and Hurst Copse have permissive access


Franz-Erich Wolter

Franz-Erich Wolter is a German computer scientist chaired professor at Leibniz University of Hannover with research contributions especially in computational differential geometry and haptic/tactile Virtual reality
He currently heads the Institute of Man-Machine Communication and is the Dean of Studies in Computer Science at the Leibniz University of Hannover
He is the founder and actual director of the Welfenlab research laboratory
Research
Wolter's early contributions were in the area of Differential Geometry dealing with the Cut Locus characterizing it as the closure of a set where the shortest geodesics starting from a point or a general source set intersect or equivalently where the distance function is not directionally differentiable implying that a complete Riemannian manifold M must be diffeomorphic to R^n if there is a point p on M s.t the squared distance function wrt to p is directionally differentiable on all M His Ph.D thesis 1985 transferred the concept of Cut Locus to manifolds with and without boundary
In 1992 essentially a specialisation of the latter works lead to his paper presenting a mathematical foundation of the medial axis of solid objects in Euclidean space It showed that the medial axis of a solid body can be viewed as the interior Cut Locus of the solid`s boundary and the medial axis is a deformation retract of the solid Therefore it represents the homotopy type of a solid thus including the solid's homology type Furthermore the medial axis can be used to reconstruct the solid Later on since 1997 the subject of the medial axis received a rapidly growing attention in computational geometry but also wrt its applications in vision and robotics A Voronoi diagram of a finite point set A in Euclidean space can be viewed as Cut Locus of that point set In 1997 Wolter apparently pioneered computations of geodesic Voronoi diagrams and geodesic medial axis on general parametrized curved surfaces In the surface case the length of a shortest geodesic join defines the distance between two points In 2007 Wolter extended the computations of geodesic Voronoi diagrams and geodesic medial axis inverse transform to Riemannian 3D-manifolds
Wolter's early works on computing Riemannian Laplace Beltrami spectra for surfaces and images lead to a patent application in 2005 for a method using those spectra as Shape DNA for recognizing and retrieving surfaces solids and images from data repositories
His works used the heat trace of a Riemannian Laplace Beltrami operator wrt a surface patch to numerically compute area length of boundary curves and Euler Characteristic of the patch All this later on stimulated research in the area of spectral shape analysis wrt shape retrieval and shape analysis including applications in biomedical shape cognition and especially using the heat kernel more precisely the heat trace for partial shape cognition and the global point signature
Wolter was responsible for creating model and software for the haptic/tactile renderer of the visuo-haptic-tactile Virtual Reality VR system HAPTEX ? HAPtic sensing of virtual TEXtiles developed as multinational EU-project 2004-2007 Haptic and tactile perception are considered as different with tactile referring to perception obtained via mechano receptors in the skin from lightly touching a surface while haptic perception caused by more forceful mechanical interaction with an object perhaps deforming it HAPTEX appears to be the only VR-System allowing simultaneously a combined haptic and tactile perception of multi point haptic interaction with computer generated deformable objects c.f
Under Wolter's guidance research on the haptic and tactile renderer of HAPTEX resulted in two doctoral theses of his students published as monographies by Springer cf
More recently Wolter's works have covered research on volumetric biomedical visualization systems YaDIV and haptic tactile VR-Systems currently including haptic interaction with medical volumetrically presented MRI and CT data
Biography
Prof Wolter received a Diploma in Mathematics and Theoretical Physics from the Free University of Berlin and a Ph.D 1985 in Mathematics from the Berlin Institute of Technology After his Ph.D before switching to an academic career he had been working as software and development engineer in the electrical industry for AEG Prior to coming to Hannover he held faculty positions at the University of Hamburg Germany at MIT USA and at Purdue University USA
Early on and throughout his career Wolter hold for extended periods various positions as a visiting professor at well known schools including especially MIT three times Nanyang Technical University Purdue University He has been presenting seminars at many prestigious Universities including Harvard Yale Stanford Brown University MIT and more recently in Asia Tsinghua University Zheiyang University and Nanyang Technical University He gave Keynote Speeches at CGI 2000 and CGI 2010 covering major parts described in the above research section
Wolter is an associate editor of the Springer Journal The Visual Computer He had been General Chair of the international conferences Computer Graphics International 1998 Cyberworlds and NASAGEM 2007 Computer Graphics International 2013
Awards and Honors
Wolter's article on the computation of geodesic Voronoi diagrams on parametric surfaces received the best paper award of CGI 1997 His paper on Laplace Beltrami Spectra as Shape DNA received the most cited paper award of the CAD journal in 2009 His joint paper with partners of the EU funded Haptex project received the best applied paper award of JVR - journal

Danny is mortally wounded
In the coming days Michelle visits Nick in the hospital as he recovers from his gunshot wound to the stomach When he learns that Danny died from his wounds and knowing that he violated his parole and would be sent back to prison?no matter how good his intentions in stopping the attack Nick leaves the hospital with Michelle's help and the two drive to the home of Nick's brother Dean and his pregnant wife There they get a glimpse of a domestic life they have never known The relationship between the two brothers remains strained yet Nick reaches out to make some familial connection with Dean whose only advice is to disappear
The next morning Nick and Michelle leave in Nick's old truck knowing they have become outlaws on the run They find solace in each other's arms that night in a motel Soon after police detectives arrive at Dean's house with the gun he gave his brother Convinced that Michelle gave the gun to police when Nick calls Dean tells him that she betrayed him Later Nick confronts Michelle about the gun and she swears she did not give it to the police ? that they must have discovered where she had hidden the weapon That night they make love
In the morning Michelle discovers that Nick has abandoned her perhaps for her own protection Later back at her motel Michelle is arrested by the police and she is taken to jail Meanwhile Nick drives to his daughter's school and meets one of her teachers who tells him she is doing fine After school he observes his daughter leaving with her friends but he does not approach her Sometime later on a quiet deserted lake Nick floats across the water in his old boat

Ming City Wall Relics Park

The Ming City Wall Relics Park is a park in Beijing with the longest and best preserved section of the city's Ming Dynasty city wall The park is located from the city center and extends west from Chongwenmen to Dongbianmen and then north to near the Beijing Railway Station The park features a section of the Ming city wall and the Southeast Corner Tower which are over 550 years old and surrounded by green park space to the south and east The park covers an area of including of fortifications and of green space Access to the corner tower and the ramparts atop the wall is available during business hours and require paying admission The corner tower also houses the Red Gate Gallery The rest of the park is free and open to the public at all times
Location and access
The park is located at the southeast corner of Beijing's inner walled city about southeast of Tiananmen Square in what is now Dongcheng District just inside the Second Ring Road Preserved in the park is a section of the city wall including the Southeast Corner Tower that once connected Chongwenmen and Dongbianmen two city gates that have been replaced with roadway intersections The longer southern city wall is attached to the Southeast Corner Tower itself while a shorter section of the eastern city wall is separated from the corner tower by a railway out of the Beijing Railway Station Park space at the foot of the southern city wall extends along Chongwenmen East Avenue to the Second Ring Road The Beijing Ancient Observatory built atop another section of the eastern city wall at Jianguomen is a short walk north of the corner tower The Beijing Railway Station and its rail depots occupy the area immediately north of the park
The corner tower's exhibits and ramparts are open from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm Admission is Y10 for adults half-price for students Children below 1.2 m in height and senior citizens are admitted for free The park space is not enclosed and is accessible to the public at all hours The park is popular with tourists visiting the wall and residents from the surrounding neighborhood who use the green space for recreation and dog walking The park hosts the annual Huashi Saturn Peach Temple Festival
The Ming City Wall Relics Park is accessible by Beijing Bus to Dongbianmen Routes 25 29 39 43 44 59 434 525 610 674 and ì¡2 Chongwenmen East Routes 12 25 39 43 44 525 610 and Jianguomen South Routes 25 39 43 44 52 122 434 637 638 750 and ì¡2 and by Beijing Subway to Chongwenmen Line 2 and Jianguomen Lines 1 and 2
History
Beijing's inner city wall was built during the Ming Dynasty in 1419 The Ming city walls stood for nearly 550 years until the construction of the early 1960s when most of the gates and walls were torn down to construct the Beijing Subway which runs underneath where the walls stood The subway's inner loop line turned into the old city at Chongwenmen to stop at the Beijing Railway Station and did not need to run beneath a section of the wall at the southeast corner of the inner city Of the 40?km of the original wall only this 1.5?km section was spared Inside this section of the wall north of the wall are railway yards of Beijing Station Outside the wall south of the wall stood residential homes and small businesses
In the late 1990s the city government decided convert the remnants of the wall into a park and relocate the small businesses and homes between the foot of the southern city wall and Chongwenmen East Avenue The relocated businesses and residents received compensation and tax exemptions Construction began in November 2001 The homes which lacked indoor heating plumbing and running water were razed but large trees that stood in the courtyards were preserved To preserve the historical integrity of the fortifications the authorities solicited donations of Ming era bricks from city residents to use in the restoration About of one-fifth of 2,000,000 bricks used in the restoration are from the Ming-era
When the park was completed in September 2003 national leaders Jiang Zemin Li Lanqing Wan Li Ding Guan'gen and then municipal party secretary Jia Qinglin and mayor Liu Qi visited the park

List of shopping malls in Nicaragua

The 1972 Managua earthquake virtually destroyed all of the existing supermarkets shops and department stores in the city of Managua New shopping centers and malls were rebuilt on other locations which formed the bases for Managua's dispersed structure
History
The seventies Rebuilding Managua
The Somoza regime declared 1973 as the year of Hope and Reconstruction Many of the shops destroyed by the earthquake were relocated to the premises of the old Livestock Fair next to the Colonia Centroamerica neighborhood forming the Centro Comercial Managua built in provisional facilities
A modern and more permanent shopping center was built in 1974 the Centro Comercial Camino de Oriente with movie theaters restaurants a bowling alley and two night clubs the Lobo Jack and Infinito Discotheque Under the same premise a smaller shopping center at the Colonia Centroamerica was built the Plaza de Compras de la Centroamerica today almost abandoned housing only a supermarket a fast food chain and some smaller office spaces
Several commercial projects were carried out in the seventies all of them in the new neighborhoods of the periphery of Managua such as the Centro Comercial Plaza Espana built in 1975 in the upscale Bolonia neighborhood Other shopping centers of that time are the Centro Comercial Nejapa which housed the Managua Local District Court until the end of 2012 and similar developments in the neighborhoods of Bello Horizonte Ciudad Jardin and Linda Vista
Present and future
Many of the shopping centers built in the seventies are now partially abandoned or used for other purposes One notable exception is Metrocentro Managua built in 1974 by Salvadorean investors and renovated and extended with more store space and the building of the four-star Hotel Real InterContinental Metrocentro Managua in 1998 and 2004
In 1998 thanks to the economic improvement after the civil war of the last decade the new Plaza Inter shopping mall was built in Managua's historical center by foreign investors
With the new millennium larger and more spacious shopping malls were built such as Galerias Santo Domingo in 2005 and Multicentro Las Americas in 2006 In 2011 the first shopping mall outside the capital city Managua was built with the Centro Plaza Occidente in Chinandega Another one Multicentro Esteli is scheduled for opening in 2013 in the northern city of Esteli
Strip malls
As Managua spread out following the earthquake a large number of strip malls or shopping plazas were built all around the city These strip malls are home to a small number of stores usually between five and fifteen and are located in Managua's main commercial arteries and neighbourhoods A non-exhaustive list of strip malls include


NZASM 40 Tonner 0-6-2T

The NZASM 40 Tonner 0-6-2T of 1892 is a South African steam locomotive from the pre-Union era in the Transvaal
In 1892 and 1893 the Nederlandsche-Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorweg-Maatschappij of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek Transvaal Republic placed twenty tank locomotives with a 0-6-2 wheel arrangement in mainline service Since the railway classified its locomotives according to their weight these locomotives were known as the
Manufacturer
Although the completion of the line from Delagoa Bay to Pretoria was still more than three years in the future a requirement for larger and heavier mainline locomotives was identified in 1891 The Nederlandsche-Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorweg-Maatschappij NZASM therefore ordered ten 0-6-2T tank locomotives from Emil KesslerÅfs Maschinenfabrik Esslingen A second order for another ten followed later in 1891
The first batch of locomotives were delivered in 1892 numbered in the range from 41 to 50 Of the second batch numbered in the range from 51 to 60 the last seven were built in 1892
The locomotives were equipped with Walschaerts valve gear Since the NZASM classified its locomotives according to their weight these locomotives were known as In addition to being numbered they were all named as well with the names and numbers cast in brass and mounted on their tank sides
Service
NZASM
The 40 Tonners were found to be satisfactory in service but their trailing wheels initially proved to be somewhat troublesome The trailing wheels were attached directly to the frame which gave the locomotive a rigid wheelbase The problem arose as a result of insufficient sideward freedom of movement of the trailing axle when the locomotive traversed sharp curves and turnouts Furthermore the absence of leading carrying wheels resulted in a rough ride
Selati Railway
In June 1890 Eugene the younger of the Barons Oppenheim sought to obtain a concession from the Government of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek to construct a line to the Murchison Range goldfields along the Selati River Work on the construction of the Selati Railway in the Transvaal Lowveld began early in 1893 branching off from the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay line at a junction near Komatipoort The two locomotives Durban and Pietermaritzburg were purchased from the Natal Government Railways for use during construction as well as two 40 Tonners that were acquired from the NZASM The project was abandoned in 1894 due to financial difficulties as well as a dispute that arose with the NZASM over the chosen route Work on the line was only resumed and completed by the Central South African Railways CSAR in 1909
Imperial Military Railways
All railway operations in the two Boer Republics the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek and the Orange Free State were taken over by the Imperial Military Railways IMR in 1899 during the South African War Nineteen of the survived the war
Central South African Railways
At the end of the war when the IMR was transformed into the CSAR the nineteen surviving 40 Tonners were designated CSAR Class A and renumbered in the range from 1 to 19
None survived in railway service to be taken onto the South African Railways roster in 1912
Works numbers
The 40 Tonner engine numbers names works numbers and year built are shown in the table

Background
He was born as Martin Thomson in Northern Rhodesia now Zambia and educated in Southern Rhodesia now Zimbabwe and England Most of his early years were spent in remote locations in the African bush where there was no electricity gas or piped water After being awarded an LLB Hons in 1972 at Exeter University England he worked as a bus conductor in Exeter Devon for a year before moving to London where he worked firstly as a labourer building the Piccadilly Line extension to Heathrow and then as an accountant at Luzac & Co Oriental Booksellers He embraced Islam at the hand of the Raja of Mahmudabad the first director of the Regent's Park Mosque in London alayhi rahma on 13 August 1973 After going on Hajj the pilgrimage to Makka overland in 1977 Ahmad Thomson completed his training as a lawyer and was called to the Bar of England & Wales on 26 July 1979
British Media and The Next World Order
Thomson first came to public attention in 2001 when he featured in an award winning documentary My Name is Ahmed broadcast on BBC2 on 14 August 2001 and in Prince Naseem's Guide to Islam broadcast on BBC2 on 15 August 2001 He subsequently appeared in the first two Shariah TV series broadcast on Channel 4 on 18 May 2004 and 25 May 2004 and in April 2005 He also participated in The Muslim Jesus and Celebrity Lives Sharia Style He has been an occasional guest on the Hassan & Habibah show Legal Corner Legal Forum Weekly Review Politics & Media and the Hayaat show broadcast on Islam Channel
Following his support of Dar Al-Taqwa's successful complaint to the Press Complaints Commission concerning a deliberately misleading and inflammatory attack by the Evening Standard in July 2005 a group of British journalists including Toby Helm David Cesarani and Daniel Kahtan who had never met or interviewed Mr Thomson retaliated by alleging that Thomson's 1994 book The Next World Order which had by then been out of print for several years contained allegations that Freemasons and Jews control the governments of Europe and America and that it was a big lie that six million Jews died in the Holocaust
In fact Thomson had simply stated that it is a big lie to assert that those whom Arthur Koestler has described as the thirteenth tribe are descended from the Tribe of Israel Jacob the son of Isaac when in fact they are not descended from Shem the son of Noah but from Yapheth the son of Noah and are accordingly Turkic It is the Arab Palestinians who are descended from Shem and accordingly semitic this adjective being derived from the word shem Thomson had allegedly written that Jews have no right to live in what he called the Holy Land because they are not a pure race and are therefore not biblical Israelites In fact he had simply pointed out that the homeland of the descendants of the Khazars is between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea not Palestine
Elsewhere it was alleged that Thomson has said that Saddam Hussein was used as an excuse for U.S troops including thousands of Jews to occupy Saudi Arabia and that the invasion of Iraq was part of a Zionist plan to realise the publicly declared Zionist aim of establishing the Greater Eretz between the Nile and the Euphrates
By using each other as their sources these journalists created the impression that their articles were thoroughly researched and were therefore eligible to be regarded as reliable sources by newspapers and internet bloggers alike
Asked about Thomson's role as an informal advisor to the government a government spokesperson told the Daily Telegraph We talk to a lot of people including many whose views we do not necessarily agree with ? and some whose views are deliberately distorted by the media in order to encourage involuntary disagreement with them from the outset just in case they might possibly have something worthwhile to say
Thomson responded to the reports by saying that the story was grossly distorted He said that he had not denied the Holocaust and that I have always said that one unjust death is one too many At present only the slaughter of Muslim civilians requires independent verification He also wrote ÅgTo be anti-Zionism is not to be racist or anti-JewishÅh and ÅgTo be anti-Zionism is not to be anti-SemiticÅh and ÅgTo be anti-Zionism is not to be a conspiracy theorist.Åh
Since then in partial confirmation of some of the allegations made by Toby Helm about Mr Thomson former Prime Minister Tony Blair was appointed UN advisor to the government of Israel and became a grateful beneficiary of lucrative oil contracts in Iraq
Views on Islam
Thomson has written that radical Islam is a contradiction in terms It is not possible to be a true Muslim and simultaneously a violent terrorist He has also written unequivocally against any form of military-industrial-complex dictated bank authorized state sponsored indiscriminate laser precision bombing whether this involves the collective punishment of civilians or their decimation or their genocide or suicide bombing
Thomson has also been quoted as saying ÅgIslam is not just a matter of words As the Prophet said may Allah bless him and grant him peace ÅeThe Shahada is easy on the tongue but much flows from it.Åf Ever since I said Shahada I have lived every moment of my life finding out what it entails It is a process that never ends.Åh The Shahada is to bear witness that there is no god other than Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah may Allah bless him and grant him peace
When describing his first pilgrimage to Makka Thomson wrote ÅgWhen I had first embraced Islam some four years earlier I had known next to nothing about it other than the fact that the community of Muslims whom I had joined were more knowledgeable and radiant and better behaved than any other human beings that I had ever met during my life up until then I had embraced Islam in the hope of acquiring that knowledge and radiance and courteous behaviour and as time passed my hopes were gradually fulfilled as little by little I learned about and tried to embody the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad may the Blessings and Peace of Allah be on him
In a personal face-to-face FiveBooks interview with Tom Dannet in 2010 Thomson said WeÅfre 14 centuries-plus from the time of the Prophet now and if you look at the history of Islam there have been high points and low points As within any religion you find people of wisdom and also people of great ignorance who use Islam for political expediency who distort it knowingly or unknowingly And so for anyone who wants to follow in the dust of the footsteps of the Prophet Muhammad blessings and peace be on him you have to get to the point before there are any schools of jurisprudence before Sunni and Shia ? and if you go to that point there's no argument just knowledge Åc As they say the nearer you get to the source the purer the drink If you go to the source of the Thames it doesnÅft taste the same as where it reaches the sea
In 2009 Thomson gave a talk at Cambridge University entitled Shariah Law A Stairway to Heaven In 2011 he participated in an interfaith event hosted at the House of Lords honouring Mary the mother of Jesus
Views on Islamic Finance
Thomson advocates a return to the use of gold and silver as means of exchange which possess intrinsic value
He has consistently pointed out that before any financial product can be described as Sharia compliant the means of exchange must be Sharia compliant ? and that the Sharia of Islam prohibits the use of an unredeemable IOU paper money either as a means of exchange unless it is backed by gold or silver or in order to pay the annual zakat on wealth which must be paid in gold or silver
Thomson has accordingly recommended that the interest-generated portion of the national debt be written off institutionalised usury be proscribed and Islamic gold dinars and silver dirhams be minted by the Royal Mint utilising the weights and measures for these coins originally established by sayyedina Umar ibn Al-Khattab the second Muslim Khalif if London is to become a global centre for Islamic Finance as advocated by the former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown

Critical reception
Initial reviews were quite varied


HMCS Dundas K229

HMCS Dundas was a that served with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War She saw action in both Atlantic and Pacific theatres of the war She was named for Dundas Ontario
Background
Flower-class corvettes like Dundas serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different to earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes The corvette designation was created by the French as a class of small warships the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877 During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity in this case based on a whaling ship design The generic name flower was used to designate the class of these ships which ? in the Royal Navy ? were named after flowering plants
Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part to better represent the people who took part in building them This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W Nelles Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas
Construction
Dundas was ordered as part of the 1940?1941 Flower-class building program She was identical to the 1939?1940 program except for a few changes The 1940?41 program had water-tube boilers which were less responsive but had more reliability in providing a consistent supply of steam The second significant change was that no minesweeping gear was ever installed as the role of the corvette had changed from coastal auxiliary to convoy escort

Our Lady Immaculate and St Joseph Church Prescot

Our Lady Immaculate and St Joseph Church is a Roman Catholic parish church in Prescot Merseyside It was built in 1856-57 by the Society of Jesus and is now in the Prescot deanery of the Archdiocese of Liverpool It is a Grade II listed building designed by Joseph Aloysius Hansom and is next to the Church of St Mary on Vicarage Place in the centre of Prescot
History
Origin
From the English Reformation until 1857 the Catholic population of Prescot had to travel to an area of the town called Portico two miles from the town centre From 1790 there was Our Lady Help of Christians Church The Catholics were so numerous that in 1583 the Bishop of Chester William Chaderton wrote to the Privy Council
Truly the Papists in these parts are lately growing so stubborn and contemptuous that in my opinion it were very requisite that their Lordships did write a very earnest letter to my good Lord the Earl of Derby myself and the rest of Her Majesty's Commissioners to deal seriously and roundly with them the Papists of Prescot otherwise there can be no reformation
Construction
In 1856 six years after the restoration of the English Catholic hierarchy and the creation of the Archdiocese of Liverpool the Jesuits founded a church in the centre of Prescot and asked Joseph Aloysius Hansom to design it for them He also designed Church of St Walburge in Preston St Joseph's Church in Leigh St Beuno's Ignatian Spirituality Centre in Tremeirchion and the Church of the Holy Name of Jesus in Manchester for the Jesuits The building was opened for worship a year later
Handover
On 28 September 1932 the church was taken into the care of the Archdiocese of Liverpool At the time many churches served by the Jesuits were being given to their respective dioceses Within the same year both Holy Cross Church in St Helens Merseyside and St John's Church in Wigan were handed over to the archdiocese
Parish
The church has a Mass at 6:15pm on Saturday evening for Sunday and another Mass at 11:00am Sunday morning There are weekday Masses at 9:15am from Monday to Wednesday and at 12 noon from Thursday to Saturday
Both the Our Lady of Help of Christians and Our Lady Immaculate and St Joseph churches have a relationship with Our Lady's Primary School in Prescot whose mission statement states What we hoped to achieve in all that we do is as a living community of God


Miles J Jones

Miles James Alfred Jones Jr M.D 2 April 1952- 9 February 2013 was a forensic pathologist who became one of the most notorious physician-abusers of internet-mediated services He was also cited for contempt of the U.S Congress for failure to appear before it concerning his activities in the sale of fetal body parts The Federal Bureau of Investigation subsequently considered criminal charges against Jones for the latter enterprise but he was eventually imprisoned in the Federal Corrections System for failure to pay U.S income taxes for two years
Early Life & Education
Miles Jones was raised in Willow Grove Pennsylvania and he attended public schools there Jones matriculated to Princeton University Princeton NJ and graduated from that institution with a B.S degree in Biology in 1973 He then attended Howard University College of Medicine in Washington D.C and was granted the M.D degree in 1977
Postgraduate Training
Dr Jones completed a one-year clinical internship in general surgery at the Cleveland Clinic Cleveland OH and then entered the residency program in anatomic and clinical pathology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN He completed his 4-year course of training in 1982 and was certified by the American Board of Pathology Even during his residency Miles demonstrated a thirst for public attention exemplified by his notification of the national media that he was going to present a landmark study on toxic-shock syndrome at a semiannual meeting of the American Society for Clinical Pathology in 1982
Employment
Jones secured a position in the section of Gynecological & Breast Pathology at the U.S Armed Forces Institute of Pathology where he worked as a junior staff pathologist for 2 years He left to accept one in a series of hospital-practice positions in general pathology which included jobs in Washington D.C Herrin IL Atlanta GA Nashville TN and Lee's Summit MO During this time Jones also obtained training and certification in forensic pathology
Medical Abuses
Sometime in the late 1990s Jones conceived a plan to procure fetal body parts from human abortions and sell them for commercial use using the internet as a conduit His intended customers were indiscriminately chosen and were defined as anyone who has the money Jones further considered opening his own abortion facility in Mexico to amplify the supply of fetal parts likening the concept to invention of the assembly line These activities came to the attention of the U.S media and ABC television did a clandestine investigation of Jones activities which culminated in filmed interviews with him that appeared on the show 20/20 in 1999
As a consequence of that publicity Jones was subpoenaed to appear before a U.S Congressional committee on bioethics He failed to comply and was cited for contempt However subsequent assessment by federal attorneys showed that Dr Jones had technically broken no existing U.S laws
His next and final enterprise was the mass-prescription of various medications?but principally of sildenafil on the internet on a site called http://www.netdr.com/ NetDr.com The medical boards of several states analyzed the propriety and legality of that operation and concluded that Jones was engaging in unprofessional practices The Washington Post ran a front-page article on his internet-prescribing operation he subsequently lost his license to practice medicine in over 20 states and was eventually struck from the register of the U.S Drug Enforcement Administration
Next Dr Jones was investigated by the U.S Treasury for failure to file income tax returns He was found guilty of that charge in 2009 and was sentenced to 18 months incarceration at the Federal Medical Center Rochester MN
Release from Prison & Death
After Jones was released from prison he could no longer practice medicine in any form He died in Liberty Missouri on February 9 2013 4 years to the day from his initial date of incarceration

Ridiculusmus

Ridiculusmus is an award-winning British theatre company founded in 1992 by Angus Barr Jon Haynes and David Woods Their work has been described as seriously funny Dadaist and physical theatre theatre critic Ian Shuttleworth wrote that Ridiculusmus is not so much rough theatre as completely dishevelled Since 1996 the company has been led by Haynes and Woods as co-directors and although the majority of their stage works in recent years have been two-handers they additionally work with a large pool of collaborators
Their first few productions were adaptations of novels but apart from a two-man version of The Importance of Being Earnest produced in 2005 since 1997 Haynes and Woods have devised and written all Ridiculusmus plays Some of these have been published by Oberon Books and commissioned by the Barbican London
Early years
The founding members met as students at London's Poor School and while there they began busking on the London underground and doing comedy club open spots They called themselves Mel Pet & Harm and performed comic songs from the 1920s and 1930s to the accompaniment of Barr's ukulele They also opened a Dadaist comedy club called The Tomato Club above a couscous restaurant in Kentish Town The highlight of the evening was the tomato spot in which comics were invited to perform deliberately bad material to an audience armed with over-ripe tomatoes The listing in Time Out said Don't come to which the magazine added probably advice worth taking
On graduating from The Poor School Ridiculusmus filled a cancelled slot at London's Canal Cafe Theatre with a hastily produced adaptation of Jerome K Jerome's Three Men in a Boat It played to mixed reviews and encouraged the troupe to produce more adaptations their next production was a promenade version of Flann O'Brien's cult classic novel The Third Policeman Opening at Aras na Gael the show with free pints of The Wrastler stout given to any audience member bringing a bicycle part became an instant small scale hit Adding fellow Poor School graduates Kevin Henshall and Lucy Cuthbertson the company grew to five members Finding it difficult to survive in London Ridiculusmus began to tour and jumped at an offer to be in residence at The Playhouse in Derry Northern Ireland A trio once again?Woods and Haynes adapted another O'Brien novel At Swim-Two-Birds which toured widely
The Sister Mary Sessions
In 1996 Ridiculusmus broke away from the adaptation of novels and began writing and producing their own work The development season in the Sister Mary room at the playhouse in Derry resulted in three self-authored pieces School The Exhibitionists and Christmas
The Exhibitionists went on to tour nationally and internationally over the next six years
ARSEFLOP
In 1999 Woods and Haynes coined the acrostic mnemonic ARSEFLOP to articulate their working principles Attitude Reality Sensitivity Edge Focus Listen Open Your Heart and Play
Later works
Ridiculusmus has created five more main stage works in the last 15 years Say Nothing Ideas Men Tough Time Nice Time Total Football and The Eradication of Schizophrenia in Western Lapland

GISHWHES

The Greatest International Scavenger Hunt the World Has Ever Seen GISHWHES pronounced gish-wes is an annual week-long competitive media scavenger hunt originally held each autumn but more recently each summer Teams of 15 competitors earn points for submitting photos and videos of themselves completing prompts from a list they receive at the beginning of the week Actor Misha Collins officially founded GISHWHES in 2011 after a publicity stunt to help the television series Supernatural"?on which Collins appears?win a People's Choice Award The competition holds a world record for being the largest media scavenger hunt ever to take place
History
Actor Misha Collins known for playing the angel Castiel on the American television series Supernatural is the founder of GISHWHES The competition began informally in 2010 when Holly Ollis a publicist for Warner Bros asked Collins to engage his audience to help Supernatural move from second place to first in the People's Choice Awards voting Collins posted a message on Twitter declaring that if the show won Ollis had promised him a rhinoceros which he would share with everyone who helped by voting for the show When Supernatural won the competition Collins asked his followers to send him self-addressed stamped envelopes into which he put scavenger hunt prompts written on the backs of jigsaw puzzle pieces from a puzzle depicting a rhino Soon participants began to respond to Collins's absurd requests One successful prompt for example challenged fans to photograph a group of firemen wearing nothing but kale The hunt was partially inspired by Collins's time at the University of Chicago as an undergraduate during which he participated in the school's annual scavenger hunt
Collins enjoyed this exercise so much that he decided to create an official scavenger hunt in 2011 He established the event's website and gave it its name the Greatest International Scavenger Hunt the World Has Ever Seen calling its acronym GISHWHES the ugliest acronym the world has ever seen According to Collins the primary reason for developing the competition was that he loved the idea of thousands of people from all over the world connecting to create incredible things He hoped to use GISHWHES to encourage participants to do good in the world The inaugural event categorized by Guinness World Records as a media scavenger hunt broke the record for the largest scavenger hunt of its kind In 2012 it broke its own record with 14,580 participants representing 69 different countries The contest broke two additional world records in 2013 the longest safety pin chain measuring and the largest online photo album of hugs totaling 108,121 images
Contest
On the first day of the week-long competition a list is posted on the GISHWHES website with over 150 different tasks for competitors to complete during the hunt which Collins and his friends including co-coordinator Jean Louise Alexander have devised prior to the beginning of the competition Teams then submit photos or videos of themselves completing the prompts at the contest's website receiving points for each item completed While literal interpretations of prompts are preferred judges will sometimes award points for especially creative responses Prizes for the team with the most points at the end of GISHWHES have included a trip to Scotland for a slumber party with Collins and a trip to Vancouver for a Viking surprise
Teams consist of 15 members who may come from different countries Individuals may prearrange teams or sign up individually in which case they are randomly grouped into appropriately sized teams As of the 2013 contest signup costs ran $19 per person with participation fees going towards Random Acts a non-profit run by Collins that aims to encourage random acts of kindness
Challenges
GISHWHES challenges vary widely in focus and sometimes attract media attention The Los Angeles-focused OC Weekly reported on a local ice cream shop's response to a GISHWHES team that asked them to create a custom ice cream flavor for the 2013 challenge Get your team's new ice cream flavor on sale in an ice cream parlor Another challenge involved participants using and spreading the word abnosome Collins's portmanteau of abnormal and awesome During the 2013 hunt competitors were asked to dress up as the DC Comics character Flash and have their pictures taken next to a functioning particle accelerator As a result the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and Fermilab received numerous emails from GISHWHES participants and set up special tours for the visitors Dean Golembeski reported in Symmetry the official magazine of Fermilab and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory that the visits were welcomed and seen as an opportunity to educate a wider audience on the goals of and research done at national laboratories
Most GISHWHES challenges are completed successfully by at least one team according to Collins During the 2012 contest for example only one item saw no successes coating a commercial blimp with fall leaves Collins speculated it failed because of physical limitations A 2013 challenge noted by Ecrans a French website run by Liberation challenged competitors to convince astronauts on the International Space Station to take a photo holding a sign with their team's name Efforts by participants were headed off by NASA which posted that the astronauts were unable to participate on its official Twitter account
Reception
Aspects of the contests have been well received by some media outlets A writer for Nerdist.com called it an avalanche of awesomeness and compared the hunt's acronym to an apocryphal GWAR album or a lesser deity in H.P Lovecraft's consonant-laden pantheon Reviewing the experience of participating in GISHWHES a writer for Detroit's WKBD-TV described the contest as a lot of fun and recommended that others participate in the future Shanghai Daily deemed several of GISHWHES's challenges outrageous and visually stunning Laura Prudom of The Huffington Post commended Collins's herculean efforts in organizing the event
Not all reception has been positive Todd VanDerWerff wrote for Vox that Quite a few of the items basically invite participants to pester?or even harass?the famous and semi-famous on Twitter Tumblr and Facebook A 2014 challenge asked hunters to convince published science fiction authors to write a 140-character story for them and some such as John Scalzi and Lauren DeStefano complained that the task encouraged participants to harass them on social networks
In an article analyzing Collins's relationship with his fanbase Middlebury College Assistant Professor Louisa Ellen Stein argued that GISHWHES was a co-authored transmedia experience that playwith the power erotics and emotional excess present in Collins fandom Citing participants independent efforts to coordinate teams using a variety of online platforms Stein suggested that GISHWHES may lack the overt language of industrial reconfiguration found in the Divine Kickstarter Project webseries that Collins engaged his fans to help fund But through its satire and dadaist play it more fully models the potential for a congregation of authors both official and unofficial to direct fannish and creative investment into digital participation


Clan McGrath Clann Mac Craith

</gallery>
The Clan McGrath Irish Clann Mac Craith is an Irish Clan and recognised as such by Clans of Ireland The name has its origins in Thomond Irish Tuadhmhumhain a kingdom that existed before the Norman invasion in the area of North Munster The most notable King of Thomond was Brian Boru Irish Brian Boruma Mac Cennetig c 941 - 1014 and it is traditionally held that the Clann MacCraith was a name bestowed upon the descendants of Brian's brother Ahearne The Clan McGrath is thus a Clan of the Gaelic Irish tribe of the Dalcassian Irish Dal gCais The Clan McGrath held a special place for themselves as hereditary poets and bards among the Dalcassian and served Brian and his descendants the O'Brien princes of Thomond The link to Brian Boru and the Clan O'Brien is perhaps best illustrated in the medieval period by the adoption of the three heraldic lions of the Clan O'Brien into the arms of the Clan McGrath
From its foundations in Thomond the Clan McGrath established two main Septs one in Ulster in an area known as Termonmcgrath that incorporates the counties of Donegal Tyrone and Fermanagh The other main Sept is located in Waterford Wexford and Tipperary and straddles Munster and Leinster
Tearmann hMacCraith
Termonmcgrath in gaelic Tearmann hMacCraith
Termonmcgrath also known as Termonmagrath exists in the Barony of Tirhugh in South Donegal The territory incorporates the modern town of Pettigoe and the ancient pilgrimage island and lake of Lough Derg Termonmcgrath is also home to Castle McGrath also known as Termon Castle To the north of the McGrath territory and just outside Ballybofey is Carraig McGrath the inauguration site of the McGrath Chieftains(in gaelic Ceann Fine The Clan McGrath were the hereditary Corabs of the famous pilgrimage island of Lough Derg and controlled the routes to the pilgrimage island and the revenues gained from pilgrims making their way from across Europe to the site The Annals of Ulster detail the names and lineage of the McGrath Chieftains of Ulster from the 12th century until the eventual confiscation of McGrath lands and disposation of the Clan McGrath by the Cromwellian government in the 17th century This valuable source also gives information on the Termon The Termon was under the divine protection of the local Saint Davog Dabhog and the hereditary Chieftain We find the annals describing this Termon as Tearmann Dabhog St Davog's Termon until the end of the 15th century when in 1496 the Annals of Ulster begin to refer to it as Tearmann Mhic Craith McGrath's Termon from the Clan who held the hereditary lordship and office of Corab in gaelic Comharba
Archbishop Miler McGrath 1523 - 1622
Perhaps the most infamous of the McGraths of Termonmcgath is Bishop Miler McGrath 1523?1622 Miler was the son of the McGrath Chief Donncha and was destined for the religious life He became a Franciscan and spent some time in Rome where he acquired the bishopric of Down and Connor Although kinsman to the Gaelic Lord Shane The Proud O'Neill Miler was a master in the game of politics and alliances In 1569 he conformed to the reformed faith and was granted the Protestand bishopric of Clougher thus holding a Roman Catholic and Protestant bishopric at the same time This continued until 1580 when he was eventually deprived of the Catholic bisopic for heresy
Miler would eventually expand his influence and power across Ireland and became Archbishop of Cashel in Tipperary Miler brought 200 armed men from his ancestral home at Termonmcgrath consisting mainly of his McGrath kinsmen Their descendants are still found today in Co Tipperary Miler patrolled his lands in Tipperary carrying a sword and wearing armour a sign perhaps of the dangers a man such as he found himself Miler married Amy the daughter of the O'Meara Chieftain and fathered four sons and two daughters
In 1622 aged 100 years Miler died Prior to his death he commissioned his tomb stone which bore his effigy in the robes of a Catholic Bishop it is a tradition that Miler converted back to the Catholic faith before his death Perhaps most interestingly from a heraldry point of view Miler also had carved on his tomb stone the Arms of his house These are re-created in the above artwork You will note the heraldic antelope rampant at the bottom right hand corner This is somewhat different from the modern interpretation of the McGrath Arms we see reproduced today Miler's Arms are the earliest depiction of the McGrath Arms that we know of and are almost 500 years old

Ceresco Wisconsin

Ceresco also known as the Wisconsin Phalanx was a commune founded in Fond du Lac County Wisconsin in 1844 by followers of the communitarian socialist ideas of Charles Fourier About 180 people lived in the Association at its peak farming nearly 2,000 acres It was one of the three longest-lived Fourierist Associations in the United States dissolving in 1850 and was unique for having assets which exceeded liabilities at the time of its termination
Since the Fourierist Association had registered their community under state law the village of Ceresco Wisconsin survived the collapse of the utopian socialist experiment of the 1840s Remaining members of the Wisconsin Phalanx later formed a living cooperative and study group called the Ceresco Union in 1855 espousing the doctrines of religious freethought and interpersonal free love until disbursed by a mob of outraged citizens
In 1858 the remaining inhabitants of Ceresco were annexed by the nearby town of Ripon Wisconsin
History
Background
In 1832 the son of a wealthy New York landowner Albert Brisbane 1809-1890 a student of philosophy in search of ideas for the betterment of humanity was introduced to a newly published short work by philosopher Charles Fourier 1772-1837 entitled Treatise on Domestic and Agricultural Association Brisbane was an immediate convert to the French thinker's ideas which Fourier somewhat grandiosely ascribed to universal laws governing the development of society the understanding of which allowed productive enterprise to be reorganized on a rational basis production expanded and human needs more readily fulfilled
In 1832 Brisbane left for Paris to spend two years studying Fourier's system taking personal tutelage from the 60-year old theorist himself Brisbane would make the acquaintance of other devotees of Fourier's ideas during this initial phase of the Fourierist movement returning to the United States a committed believer and proselytizer of the Fourier's idea of Association Brisbane would soon begin work translating and expounding upon the ideas of Fourier for an American audience with his first and most famous book Social Destiny of Man seeing print in 1840
Brisbane's book was well-received and it enjoyed immediate success gaining a broad readership among those concerned with the problems of society and helping to launch the Fourierist movement in the United States Among those who read Brisbane's book and was thereby converted to the ideas of socialism was a young New York newspaper publisher Horace Greeley later elected to the US House of Representatives Greeley would provide valuable service to the Fourierist movement by advancing its ideas in the pages of his newspaper of that day The New Yorker throughout 1840 and 1841 and offering Brisbane a column in his successor publication the New York Tribune from the time of its establishment in March 1842
A further book by Brisbane adapting Fourier's ideas to American conditions entitled Association Or A Concise Exposition of the Practical Part of Fourier's Social Science would be published in 1843 A faddish boom seeking to test Fourier's ideas on Association in practice soon followed and from 1843 to 1845 more than 30 Fourierian phalanxes were established in a number of northern and midwestern states The so-called Wisconsin Phalanx known to its participants as Ceresco was one of these practical experiments which attempted to put into practice the Fourierian ideas
Establishment
The Upper Midwest was not immune to the Fourierist hubbub that had begun to percolate in the United States in 1843 In the fall of that year the Franklin Lyceum of Southport today known as Kenosha began taking up discussion of Fourier's ideas in a series of public discussions On November 21 the society debated the proposition Does the system of Fourier present a practicable plan for such a reorganization of society as will guard against our present social ills After a week's pause two more successive weekly meetings of the lyceum were dedicated to the Fourier program
One of those Southport residents most interested in the Fourier system was a 30-year old named Warren Chase a future Wisconsin and California State Senator Convinced of the applicability of Fourier's Associationist prescription Chase committed himself to the emerging movement without reservation organizing a series of preliminary meetings to draft a constitution for a local phalanx
On March 23 1844 a formal meeting of phalanx supporters was held at the Southport village schoolhouse and officers were elected in accordance with the constitution previously drafted Five hundred copies of the group's constitution and bylaws were printed for public distribution and a group of three including Warren Chase were tapped as trustees of the phalanx to serve as legal title-holders to all the property of the nascent community A bond sale of $10,000 was approved and stock in the new enterprise began to be sold Shares of stock were sold for $25 each payable in cash or property By the end of May 1844 membership in the forthcoming phalanx stood at 71
A domain for the phalanx had been located in the spring and on May 8 1844 the decision made to purchase 1.25 sections 800 acres of attractive government land located in a valley between two gentle hills By that fall a total of 1.5 sections 960 acres were purchased Instructions were issued to participants to obtain a tent to provide temporary shelter until permanent housing could be constructed and details for provisioning the settling party arranged
The group arrived on the site on Saturday May 25 1844 at 5 pm naming their community Ceresco after Ceres Roman goddess of the harvest A total of 19 men and a 7-year old boy were on hand for the launch immediately dividing themselves into agricultural and mechanical series with the former assigned the immediate task of beginning plowing while the latter began digging a cellar for the group's first frame building intended as the central wing of a structure planned to be extended to 120 feet in length Upon completion in 1845 the finished long building for collective housing would measure 208 feet long by 32 feet wide
Governance
According to the constitution of the Association decisions were to made by an elected group including four executive officers ? a president vice-president secretary and treasurer ? as well as a nine person board of managers It was specified that these officers could be removed from their positions for neglect of duty absence or incompetence Three trustees were to hold title to the organization's property The board of managers and officers were prohibited from entering into any contract without the unanimous approval of the community's stockholders
In accordance with the Fourierist joint-stock system individuals could participate either as stockholders or as members or as both No person could be admitted to membership without approval of the board of managers however with the board given latitude to set conditions of membership Membership could be terminated upon two weeks notice with those withdrawing from the Association to receive their pro rated share of profits of the enterprise up to that date
Stockholders were to meet twice yearly Stockholders received one vote for their first share and an additional vote for each five shares thereafter the total of votes per individual not to exceed ten Both men and women were allowed to hold stock and granted the voting rights associated with stock ownership
Every December the cash value of the phalanx's real estate was to be estimated and any increase declared as payments for labor divided according to hours worked or shareholder profits divided according to the number of shares held Necessary products and board were to be furnished to the phalanx's members at cost and rent collected for living in the group's collective housing Individuals were permitted to keep their own horse and carriage on the association's land with payment to be made to cover the actual cost of animal maintenance
The elected board of managers was to make the business decisions of the phalanx and to differentiate and assess the various types of work Whenever five or more individuals engaged in a similar branch of industry these were to organize as a group and to elect a foreman who would be charged with keeping an account of the work performed by each member of that unit
Multiple groups in similar pursuits were to in turn organize themselves as a series and to elect a superintendent who would assess the productiveness of each group in the series Under the theoretical Fourierist scheme once a community grew to sufficient scale these superintendents were to constitute themselves as a council of industry This elaborate bureaucratic apparatus above the level of groups and foremen remained in the distant mists of Fourierian fantasy due to the small scale of the Wisconsin experiment it should be noted
Disagreements were to be settled by arbitration in which each involved party was to select an arbitrator with the two arbitrators selecting a third Decisions of the arbitrators could be appealed to the board whose decision would be final This system seems to have been effective as no lawsuits ever took place between members of the phalanx or between departing parties and the organized association for the entire time of Ceresco's existence
Daily life
The domain of the Wisconsin Phalanx was obtained without the incurrence of mortgage debt A stream called Crystal Creek ran through the property with sufficient elevation to allow for installment of a water-driven mill Quantities of limestone were on hand for the needs of construction and the land selected included a suitable mix of tillable prairie and timbler
Upon arrival late in the spring of 1844 the Ceresco colonists immediately planted 20 acres to spring crops including potatoes buckwheat and turnips before turning to sowing 100 acres winter wheat Three buildings were constructed by fall enough to house about 80 men women and children In accord with the Fourierist scheme which placed emphasis on collective living cooking was done in a single kitchen and meals served on a single table
Tents remained in use for much of the first year with sufficient accommodations finally constructed by the middle of September 1844 to allow their return to Southport
The family unit was retained with division expressing itself among the members of the Association over the system of collective living and eating Permission was eventually given for individual families to be provided with foodstuffs for their own preparation although the great majority of participants remained committed to Fourier's collectivist model through 1845
Regular meetings were held for the discussion of business and social gatherings were frequent
Liquor was banished from the premises and Chase noting in his December 1845 annual report that the four great evils with which the world is afflicted ? intoxication lawsuits quarreling and profane swearing ? never have and with the present character and prevailing habits of our members never can find admittance into our society
This moral code was enforced by the threat of expulsion which could be enacted by a simple majority vote of residents The list of specified offenses for which expulsion could result was extensive including rude and indecent behavior drunkenness trafficking in intoxicating drinks profane swearing lying stealing or defrauding another protracted idleness willfully injuring the property of the association knowingly consenting to the injury of the association or any individual member thereof gambling habitually engaging in censoriousness and faultfinding
Religion
The Wisconsin Phalanx's deep concern with profanity honesty and temperance was not accidental Although nominally secular American Fourierism was marked with strong religious overtones American popularizer Albert Brisbane was emphatic in this regard quoting Fourier's assertion that The Love of God will become in this new Order the most ardent Love among Men Not only would the fidelity of marital union be preserved Brisbane promised but Association would respect sacredly the Religious Sentiment and preserve religious Worship which is the external manifestation of that Sentiment in the human soul
Brisbane expanded this perspective at some length
The horrors perpetrated in religious wars and persecutions the atrocities of the Inquisition and other outrages committed in the name of Religion are certainly appalling to contemplate Struck with these abuses and believing them inherent in Religion some reformers have wished to abolish it they have not had the perspicuity to separate the abuses of Religion from Religion itself ? to separate the effect of sectarian Fanaticism acting upon ignorant and deluded minds from true Religion and the high and exalted sentiments connected with it
Unsurprisingly Brisbane's Christian reformationism found sympathetic ears among Wisconsin's Fourier enthusiasts living at Ceresco who were rather religious rather than irreligious the ranks of which included Methodist preacher Uriel Farmin and Baptist minister George H Stebbins
Sunday school and Bible study classes were conducted with various religious denominations making use of the main hall for their services in sequence De facto leader of the community Warren Chase emphasized the religious harmony of members of the phalanx noting in a letter that although we have many members of different religious societies they all seem determined to lay aside metaphysical differences and make a united social effort founded on the fundamental principles of religion
Outside suspicions that the Wisconsin Phalanx was irreligious were hotly denied In June 1848 one member replied to such a charge with a published letter in The Investigator which declared
Some of us are and have been Methodists Baptists Presbyterians Congregationalists etc Others have never been members of any church but with very few exceptions very readily admit the authenticity and moral value of the Scriptures The ten commandments are the sum substance and foundation of all true law Add to this the gospel of love and you have a code of laws worthy of adoption and practice by any set of men and upon which associationists must base themselves or they never can succeed
This assessment was confirmed by a Methodist circuit rider who visited the community who noted that though a few of the men were professed infidels they always received ministers gladly and treated them with consideration Other observers contended that religious observation declined in the enterprise's final years
Expansion
Ceresco continued to grow through 1846 boosting its debt-free acreage to 1,633 ? of which about 800 acres were to be committed to crops The board was extremely selective with the admission of new members accepting only one new family between December 1845 and March 1846 despite a plethora of applications
Warren Chase was ebullient about the phalanx's prospects and spoke of the Fourier system in almost mystical terms writing
Success with us is no longer a matter of doubt We feel and known that our condition and prospects are truly cheering and to the friends of the cause we can say Come on not to join us but to form other Associations for we can not receive one-tenth of those who apply for admission Nothing but the general principles of Association are lawful tender with us Money will not buy admission for those who have no faith in the principles but who merely believe as most of our neighbors do that we shall get rich With our material our means and the principles of eternal truth on our side success is neither doubtful nor surprising
Unsurprisingly educational and cultural projects proceeded at a slower pace than basic construction and agriculture with a stone schoolhouse eventually constructed in 1845 and a reading room for adult members unveiled towards the start of 1846 A 60-foot long washhouse a henhouse and a sawmill during the commune's first 18 months and a blacksmith and a cobbler practiced their respective crafts Agriculture remained the chief preoccupation of most members of the phalanx with a total of 1,553 acres obtained for Ceresco through 1845
By the end of 1846 the settlement had grown to 180 residents ? 56 men 37 women and 87 children and youth under age 21 Of these there were 36 families and 30 single adults This would mark the peak membership for the Ceresco association Ominously for the fate of the collective enterprise only a minority of Ceresco associationists were eating together at the general table by this date with 100 people part of the 21 families which prepared their meals and ate as traditional nuclear units
Despite the loss of four families over 1846 applicants still far surpassed the available space with fewer than one-quarter of prospective associationists admitted to membership in the phalanx
Decline
With the Fourierist movement in rapid decline on a national basis in 1846 and 1847 the Wisconsin Phalanx's place became even more prominent in the pages of The Harbinger the national organ of the Associationists Ceresco was not immune to the general malaise however and its own membership began to slowly decline Moreover even the ever-optimistic Warren Chase was forced to admit that three or four of the remaining families were restless discontented spirits who were not contented and happy
The reality of collective living was a disrupting influence The merging of family units into one great household and the consequent formation of humanitarian bonds was a fundamental tenant of Fourierism with Albert Brisbane describing the shattering of familial isolation in enthusiastic terms in his short 1843 book
man is by nature a social being he requires and should form the largest social unions possible and numerous and various social ties with his fellow-men The present system of society is based upon the smallest possible social union ? that of a single family in a separate house by themselves A true Social Order should be based upon large Associations of about eighteen hundred persons or three hundred families and not upon small Associations of six or eight individuals or single families
The reality of tightly shared accommodations with numerous families occupying rooms in a single crowded long house proved less than compelling for many members of the phalanx's resident community The community was sharply divided over the matter of the construction of new collective living quarters as opposed to comfortable accommodation for individual families while an increasing number of committed vegetarians made common dining increasingly impractical Moreover the lack of a proper reading room galled many of the intellectual members of the group
As land values escalated and the phalanx's financial status seemed more secure the board began requiring larger and larger cash investments for admission to membership Consequently few new members were gained energetic workers committed to the associationist ideal without sufficient financial means were turned away Stagnation was the result
By the end of 1847 resident membership at Ceresco had fallen to 157 people ? 52 men and 34 women and 71 children and youths under age 21 Thirty-two families were in residence with four families bought out of their investment by the community during the course of the year The community's flour mill had finally begun operation in June and increased property values helped to keep the Association solvent and a total of 1,713 acres were owned by the Phalanx Nevertheless indications of stagnation and decline had begun to make themselves evident
Those departing were bought out of their original investments by the Wisconsin Phalanx corporation As the phalanx was heavily invested in land and infrastructure and available cash was in short supply these payments generally took the form of orders on the treasury payable at some future date usually bearing 10 or 12 percent interest
Membership continued to slide in 1848 with only 29 families with 120 people remaining to be counted in the annual report prepared each December Six families had left during the year and only three had been gained in addition there had been seven deaths mostly of young children
Dissolution
By the summer of 1849 it had become clear that dissolution of the Wisconsin Phalanx was imminent Many of those who had not departed Ceresco were interested in obtaining pieces of the communal lands and forming a traditional village on the site At the association's request the Marquette County surveyor was employed to survey communal lands into discrete parcels
Determined to avoid legal action the community began to liquidate its movable assets to cover the redemption of stock held by departing members From a high point of $33,000 in stock by the first of 1850 the total had been whittled down to $23,000 outstanding The sale of land was blocked by the Wisconsin Phalanx's legal charter however which required unanimous consent of stockholders or a legislative act to allow land sale The latter course of action was followed and on January 29 1850 the Wisconsin State Legislature passed a bill allowing the association's 9-member council to sell and convey real estate by their official act also to lay out and have recorded a village plat with streets and squares and public lots
Public sale of the phalanx's lands began in April 1850 By the end of the summer most of the land had been sold with the money received used to buy back outstanding shares of stock with the formal understanding that any surplus generated over par value would be split by the corporation's former stockholders A surplus of approximately 8 percent over par was accumulated during the sell-off and distributed to former members according to this formula
Ledger books were finally closed on the community in 1852 with all assets sold and the proceeds distributed
The actual cause of the dissolution remained a matter of some mystery among contemporary observers with Everett Chamberlain declaring that Human nature was the rock on which this fine ship split as did all other argosies bearing the banner of Owen or Fourier Others have shared the view that it was the escalation of property value and a desire to cash out profitably which made liquidation of the Wisconsin Phalanx inevitable
Legacy
On April 2 1853 the Wisconsin Legislature passed a statute merging the villages of Ceresco and Ripon and naming the resultant village Morena The remaining inhabitants ignored the new name incorporating as the city of Ripon in 1858
A new radical living cooperative and study group called the Ceresco Union was established in Ceresco Wisconsin in 1855 This group promoted the controversial doctrines of religious free thinking and interpersonal free love offending the conservative moral values of others in the area This last experimental communal enclave was disbursed by an angry mob one night which broke windows and doors and caused those being attacked to flee the area
The papers of the Wisconsin Phalanx were donated to the Ripon Historical Society by Robert D Mason the last president of the group shortly before his death in 1901 Included were membership records financial records correspondence and legal documents such as deeds and mortgages


Nathan Schneider

Nathan Schneider born 1984 is a journalist and author who covers religion and political movements in the United States
Writing on religion
Much of Schneider's work concerns the interrelation of religion science and politics He has written investigative articles on the John Templeton Foundation for The Nation and The Chronicle of Higher Education With the support of a Knight Grant for Reporting on Religion and American Public Life through USC's Annenberg School he did extensive reporting on the evangelical Christian philosopher and debater William Lane Craig which resulted in articles that appeared in Commonweal The Chronicle of Higher Education and Killing the Buddha
His first book God in Proof The Story of a Search from the Ancients to the Internet is a history of proofs for and against the existence of God as well as a memoir of his own conversion to Catholicism as a teenager A starred review in Booklist said Philosophy is hardly everybodyÅfs cup but by adding dollops of memoir and first-person reportage to a history of attempts to prove that God exists Schneider makes an often dry subject quite companionable In Religion Dispatches Gordon Haber wrote Schneider defines the next generation of public intellectuals?fiercely articulate indefatigably curious and Internet-savvy
Schneider's writing on religion often deals with neglected traditions of political radicalism Schneider's profile of literary critic Elaine Scarry for The Chronicle of Higher Education for instance compared her scholarship with the religious anti-nuclear movement In 2014 Al Jazeera America published his story of a Catholic nun with a secret ministry to the transgender community which was applauded by Buzzfeed and The Advocate
In 2014 he was named a columnist for America a national Catholic weekly
Occupy Wall Street
Schneider was among the first journalists to cover the Occupy Wall Street movement during its planning stages and wrote about it for Harper's Magazine The Nation The New York Times and other publications as well as in his 2013 book Thank You Anarchy Notes from the Occupy Apocalypse published by University of California Press He claims that his coverage of Occupy Wall Street served as the basis for a scene about Occupy Wall Street in HBO's The Newsroom His early articles about the movement appeared in a briefing sent to analysts at the security company Stratfor which was released by WikiLeaks as part of its Global Intelligence Files Democracy Now regularly turned to him as a correspondent about the movement and he also appeared on NPR's The Brian Lehrer Show Al Jazeera's Inside Story and an oral history of the movement by Vanity Fair and Ezra Klein of The Washington Post referred to one of his articles as the single best place to start learning about the movement Interviews with Schneider appear in two of the feature films made about the movement American Autumn and 99%
Writer Rebecca Solnit wrote the foreword to Thank You Anarchy which was adapted into an article for the Los Angeles Times In it she wrote Thanks to this meticulous and elegant book we know what one witness-participant was thinking all through the first year of Occupy and what many of the sparks and some of the tinder were thinking and what it was like to be warmed by that beautiful conflagration that spread across the world
Religion continued to feature prominently in how Schneider covered the Occupy movement According to Nick Pinto of Al Jazeera America Schneider's education and much of his writing are concerned with religion and he relies heavily on Christian vocabulary to describe his experience in Occupy Wall Street He personally became involved in the movement as an early member of the group Occupy Catholics An article on the book at Religious Left Law referred to Schneider as is clearly a brilliant young thinker in the heart of what we might call the revitalization of the religious left
Thank You Anarchy"'s cover bears a quotation from a New York Observer article?"objective journalism this is not"?referring not actually to the book but to the ambiguity of Schneider's role in the movement as a journalist and activist In a later interview with Malcolm Harris of The New New Inquiry Schneider confessed I agonized a lot about the participant-reporter thing probably more than I should have
Editorial roles
Schneider serves as an editor for two online publications Waging Nonviolence a source for original news and analysis about struggles for justice and peace and Killing the Buddha an online magazine of religion culture and politics
He is also an editor-at-large for the Social Science Research Council's online forum The Immanent Frame and a contributing editor for the news website Religion Dispatches

Issam Sartawi

Dr Issam Sartawi 1935 ? April 10 1983 was a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organization PLO
Medical background
Issam Sartawi attended university in Baghdad graduating in medicine before specializing in cardiology and getting his MD in the United States
Politics
Sartawi returned to Palestine in 1967 joined the Fatah movement and helped establish the Palestine Red Crescent Society He quickly rose to become Yasser Arafat's adviser on Europe and North America In the mid-1970s he participated with other moderate PLO members to the Paris meetings with the Israel-Palestine Peace Council of general Matti Peled under the sponsorship of former French Premier Pierre Mendes France Sartawi and the senior Israeli negotiator Aryeh Lova Eliav jointly received the Austrian Kreisky prize in 1979 for seeking an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict The meetings between the PLO and the Israel-Palestine Peace Council were detailed in the book by the Israeli peace activist Uri Avnery who was one of the negotiators According to Avnery Sartawai once told him that a French anti-Semitic leader came to his office in Paris and offered an alliance Sartawi threw him out In his view the anti-Semites are the greatest enemies of the Palestinian people
Sartawi disagreed with Arafat's rejection of Ronald Reagan's peace plan proposal of September 1982 according to which Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza would govern themselves for a five-year period and then engage in negotiations for an Israeli withdrawal and eventually a Palestinian-Jordanian state Sartawi thought that under Arafat the Palestinian National Council was refusing to be realistic and that it should have accepted the positive points in Reagan's proposal He rejected as wishful thinking attempts to interpret the recent defeat in Lebanon in 1982 as a victory remarking Another victory like this and the PLO will find itself in the Fiji Islands His position found scarce support and when Arafat barred him from speaking before the PNC he put in his resignation Arafat twice refused to accept Sartawi's resignation
Assassination
In February 1983 Portuguese socialist leader Mario Soares formally invited the PLO to send an observer to the April 1983 congress of the Socialist International in Sydney The passionately pro-Israeli Australian Labour prime minister Bob Hawke strongly objected to the PLO's invitation and the SI congress was hurriedly relocated to Albufeira Portugal Sartawi was selected by the PLO as its representative at this meeting in Portugal Because the SI counted both the Israeli Labor Party and the PLO as members it was hoped that such a meeting could promote the Middle Eastern peace process
On April 10 1983 Sartawi was shot and killed in the lobby of the Montechoro Hotel in Albufeira Portugal The gunman escaped Sartawi's assassination later claimed by the Abu Nidal Organization was witnessed by SI secretary-general Bernt Carlsson and was assumed to have been carried out so as to frustrate Carlsson's peace efforts Sartawi's funeral took place in Amman and was attended by all factions of the PLO ? even including Abu Nidal Organization members according to Maxim Ghilan founder of the International Jewish Peace Union
Memorial
In 1998 the Issam Sartawi Center for the Advancement of Peace and Democracy ISCAPD was established at the Al-Quds University the Arab University in Jerusalem in memory of Sartawi In 1999 a Portuguese author Andre Neves Bento wrote a detailed account of Issam Sartawi's assassination During his investigations Andre Neves Bento has found transfers from a bank account in the name of Samir Najem A-Din portrayed in the Western press as one of the leading PLO money men from which account money was taken for a variety of purposes On 13 March 1984 less than one year of Sartawi's assassination for example the owner of the account instructed the bank to transfer $17,000 to the Dafex arms factory in Portugal A directive given by Najem A-din to the bank was also discovered in which he orders the monthly transfer of 10,000 pounds to the account of Amin al- Banna apparently the cousin of Abu Nidal Al-Banna is suspected of involvement in the murder of Issam Sartawi Arafat's political adviser

Jeanne Chauvin

Jeanne Chauvin 22 April 1862 ? 7 September 1926 was the second woman to obtain a degree in law in France in 1890 Her application to be sworn in as a lawyer was at first rejected but after the law was changed in 1900 she was the second French woman to be authorized to plead at the bar
Early years
Jeanne Marie Marguerite Chauvin was born in Jargeau Loiret on 22 April 1862 Her parents were Jean Cezary Chauvin a notary and Marie Emilie Leseur
Chauvin's father died while she was a child and the family moved to Paris
Jeanne Chauvin was the second woman to earn a law degree in Paris
She obtained her degree in law on 18 July 1890 and her PhD in law on 2 July 1892 with a thesis titled Historical Study of the professions open to women the influence of Semitism on changes in the economic position of women in society
Her scheduled defense of her thesis was disrupted by the protests of male students
When she was later able to present her thesis she received objections from professors about her assertions on women's rights
and these objections were cheered by hostile students
Marie Popelin had tried to be admitted to the bar of Belgium in 1888 but had been refused
Since the Belgian and French civil codes were so similar in wording Jeanne Chauvin expected to be refused also Instead she turned to teaching the law to girls in secondary schools in Paris Chauvin developed a manual on Law Courses given in Paris girls schools
Some years later she was persuaded to apply for admission to the bar by Louis Frank a Belgian barrister and supporter of equal rights for women
Acceptance as a lawyer
On 24 November 1897 Chauvin applied to enroll at the Paris Bar and presented herself at the Court of Appeal of Paris to take the oath
In a finding dated 30 November 1897 the court presided over by Samuel Perivier 1828?1902 rejected her application The court said it was prohibited by law for a woman to take the oath and the court could only enforce laws but could not change them
The pretext was that according to the bar regulations of 1810 the profession of avocat was considered to be un office viril It was also asserted that women could not hold a position in the legal administration since they lacked the necessary civic rights
Jeanne Chauvin began a campaign to change the law aided by her younger brother Emile Chauvin 1870?1933 an Associate Professor of the Faculty of Law and a Deputy of Seine-et-Marne 1898?1909
Several arguments were used to make the case for women lawyers A law of 1848 said all people had the right to work according to La Fronde there were well over one hundred female lawyers in the United States and women could make unique contributions Chauvin said she wanted to act as advocate for poor women and children facing domestic problems where her role as defender will seem wholly natural - even to my colleagues
The politicians Rene Viviani and Raymond Poincare backed her campaign which was widely discussed in the press
Le Charivari perhaps reflected popular attitudes when it suggested that in order that there is no confusion between female and male lawyers Le Charivari requests that the latter wear low-necked robes Later a cartoonist in this paper had a female barrister say Seeing as you have monopolized the robe sirs it seems only logical for us to adopt breaches and a morning coat to distinguish ourselves from you
A law was finally passed on 1 December 1900 by which a woman with a degree in law could become a practicing advocate
However the law made it clear that a woman avocat could never stand in for a judge
On 19 December 1900 thirteen days after Olga Petit Jeanne Chauvin took the oath before the Court of Appeal of Paris the second woman to enter the legal profession in France
Later career
Chauvin spoke at the Second International Conference of Feminine Organizations and Institutions in June 1900
She and the feminist Marya Cheliga-Loevy favored giving an unmarried mother the right to seek out the father and demand child support
She helped to organize the International Women's Rights congress of September 1900
On 21 January 1901 Chauvin appeared before the 9th Chamber of the Criminal Court of the Seine
She did not appear in court often instead dedicating herself to teaching law to secondary school girls
Jeanne Chauvin taught at the lycee Moliere in Paris
Her teaching job may have limited her scope to accept cases However after a law was passed in 1912 in which unmarried women could pursue the father of their children for support payments she accepted cases related to this law
Jeanne Chauvin never married
On 19 January 1926 she was invested as a knight of the Legion of Honour by Raymond Poincare 1860?1934 a lawyer and former President of the Republic 1913?1920
Jeanne Chauvin died soon after in Provins Seine-et-Marne on 7 September 1926

Eilendorf Aachen

Eilendorf is a district of Aachen Germany that has around 15000 inhabitants The communities of Eilendorf and Nirm both contained within the district of Eilendorf share a border with the other Aachen districts of Brand Aachen-Mitte Rothe Erde and Haaren with the town of Verlautenheide as well as the district of Atsch in Stolberg
History
The first written mention of Eilendorf occurs in 1238 in a donation registry noting a gift from the Abbot Florenz of Kornelimunster Abbey to St Adalbert Church in Aachen It developed around a smithsonite mine which today is no longer in operation though a mining symbol still appears on the Eilendorf coat of arms In addition there was a dolostone quary as well as a line manufacturer in Eilendorf From 1577 until 1583 Eilendorf suffered billeting plundering and pillaging from foreign troops involved in the Cologne War and from 1630 to 1640 the town faced the horrors of the Thirty YearsÅf War which was surpassed only by the ruthless war of conquest waged by Louis XIV of France in 1678 As a result of the French Revolution the Kornelimunster Abbey met its abrupt end in 1794 It was finally dissolved in 1802 when all church goods became a property of the state By 1797 Eilendorf was already in political union with Forst Weiern and Hofen
The Eilendorf area stretches to the east until the Propsteier Forest and the district of Aue in Eschweiler where in 1884 the Stolberg Main Train Station was built on a track in this area On 1 April 1886 Eilendorf split from Forst to elect its own mayor and the old community borders were reestablished On 1 April 1897 the town got its own train station for commuter and freight traffic and Eilendorf and Nirm joined together as a single political community on 27 April 1900 In 1908 the first drug store opened in town
Until the administrative reforms that took place in the communities surrounding Aachen in 1971 Eilendorf was a self-administered town Beginning 1 January 1972 however it was incorporated into the city of Aachen as one of its seven districts Today the districtÅfs administration is carried out in the former Eilendorf Rathaus
With its integration into Aachen town leaders saw the possibility to address Ågoutstanding community issues in a larger context and to create the basis for a stable living environment as this would lead to a healthy community in our time
Name
Originally Eilendorf did not belong to the city of Aachen and during this early time the community's name was Erlendorf Due to the areaÅfs moist soil which is a prerequisite for the growth of Alder Erlen it is now assumed that the original name was due to the presence of these trees Through the pronunciation of the townÅfs name in the Aachen dialect however the name of Erlendorf slowly morphed into Eilendorf
Coat of arms
The Eilendorf coat of arms is divided vertically into two parts on its left side heraldic right are two mining hammers crossed against a blue field as well as a stylized viola Its right heraldic left contains the Cornelius horn inherited from the nearby Kornelimunster Abbey against a red field
Religion
Until 31 December 2009 Eilendorf was split into two Roman Catholic parishes St Severin Church which counts among the oldest church communities in Aachen and was founded through the Kornelimunster Abbey and St Apollonia Church which for a long time formed a single parish with the community at Saint Barbara Church in Rothe Erde a section of the Aachen-Mitte district On 1 January 2010 the self-administered churches of St Apollonia St Barbara and St Severin were merged into the new St Severin of Eilendorf and Rothe Erde Through this merger there is now only a single church council and parish council though the individual churches have retained their community committees
St Severin
The St Severin Parish goes back to the founding of the Kornelimunster Abbey at the site of an earlier probably Romanesque church Abbot Hyazinth Alfons Count von Suys 1713?1745 established a new place of worship with the patron saint chosen then being St Sebastian This place of worship was replaced in 1864 after plans for a larger three-nave church in the neoromantic style were drawn up by the Cologne master builder Heinrich Wiethase From 1904 until 1908 a large bell tower was constructed at the church and the original foundation stone laid by Abbot Hyazinth can still be seen within the tower The changing of the patron saint from St Sebastian to St Severin occurred following the incorporation of the parish into the Archdiocese of Cologne
St Apollonia
The St Apollonia Church lies on Apollonia Way in the upper village on Heck Street The structure was designed by Aachen architect Peter Salm and erected from 1959 until 1961 The ceremonial groundbreaking which had been anticipated for the previous decade finally occurred on 23 August 1959 On 24 and 25 March 1961 the church was consecrated in the name of St Apollonia by Bishop Johannes Pohlschneider This patron saint was chosen because of the nearby Apollonia chapel and though St Apollonia was originally established as a part of St Severin Parish it became its own parish on 21 January 1969 The church houses a mechnical Weimbs organ built in 1988
Additional religious locations
The Protestant Church of Reconciliation was established in 1979 as part of the community of Protestant Churches in Aachen
There also exists a Jewish cemetery on Von-Coels Street on the outskirts of town in the direction of Stolberg
Geography and architecture
The oldest preserved structure in the area is the Pannhaus Brewery which was formerly associated with an abbey A cornerstone of the structure that was likely added later served in former times as the pranger or pillory of the village
Even 50 years ago there were farms and fields between Aachen and Eilendorf but now a seamless transition between the two areas exists as a result of new construction connecting the industrial areas of Rothe Erde and Eilendorf South together
Landscape
The highest point in Eilendorf is known as the Wolfsberg or Gottes Segen God Bless and rises 230 meters above sea level From its top one can see all over Aachen and the Aachen Forest including its highest point the Klausberg On clear days it is also possible to see as far as the Eifel which is a low mountain range to the south In the winter the hill is used for sledding and in the Summer for sunbathing
Through the area in the direction of the Eifel there is a 50 meter difference in height between the Eilendorf communities of Nirm and Oberdorf
For the most part Eilendorf is surrounded by fields and nature except from the west where it is connected to the Aachen-Mitte district of Rothe Erde This green space is used mostly for cows rather than heavily agriculture though the number of farmers in the area has decreased dramatically over the last 50 years Most of the fields are used for the production of hay and the Haarbach a small stream and tributary of the Wurm flows northeast beneath the district of Nirm and across the train lines connecting Aachen to Eschweiler
Transportation
Public transport in Eilendorf is maintained by ASEAG with bus lines 2 12 22 50 and 57 as well as 34 and 43 in the industrial parts of the district serving the area as well as a train platform that connects Eilendorf to Aachen and Duren Trips to the center of Aachen by bus can take 30 minutes or longer
Eilendorf Train Station
The Eilendorf Platform which was a train station until the 1960s lies on the Express Line between Cologne and Aachen directly between the stops at Stolberg Main Train Station and the Aachen station at Rothe Erde The station was first opened to commuter and freight traffic in 1841 under the name of Nirm On 1 April 1897 a station building was opened at this location and though the line is heavily traveled by Intercity-Express and Thalys trains only trains of the Euregiobahn and NRW-Express services stop at the station It takes approximately three minutes to reach the first Aachen station at Rothe Erde and seven minutes to reach the Aachen Hauptbahnhof or Main Train Station


The Maid of Sker

The Maid of Sker is a three-volume novel by R D Blackmore published in 1872 Set in the late 18th-century it unravels the mystery of foundling child washed ashore upon the coast of Glamorganshire It was Blackmore's next novel published after Lorna Doone although he had begun writing it 25 years earlier Blackmore considered The Maid of Sker to be his best novel
Title and writing
The title of the novel comes from a Welsh ballad known as the The Maid of Sker although the content of the ballad bears little relation to the plot of the novel Blackmore was also familiar with Sker House near Porthcawl Blackmore's mother was from Nottage Court near Porthcawl and Blackmore spent part of his childhood with his aunt in Nottage The stark form of Sker House is a central image for Blackmore Blackmore began writing the novel while he was still a student at Oxford University He graduated in 1847 but the book was not completed and published until 1872 three years after Lorna Doone
Plot
The Maid of Sker is set at the end of the 18th century and the story is told by Davy Llewellyn an old fisherman The story concerns a two-year-old girl who drifts in a boat onto a beach in Glamorganshire in the calm before a storm The little girl calls herself Bardie Llewellyn is tempted to keep the girl but decides to give her up and keeps the boat for himself He quarters the pretty child in a simple but well-to-do household in his neighbourhood As she grows up he dotes upon her so far as he can He watches anxiously over her fortunes partly or principally because he thinks his own may be bound up with them It is clear from the refinement of the girl's manners and the from the fineness of her clothes she was washed ashore in that she is no common child
Davy joins the crew of a ketch trading between Barnstaple and Porthcawl Whilst in Devon he encounters several characters who hold the key to solving the mystery of the maid of Sker These include Sir Philip Bampfylde who spends most of his time looking for his two grandchildren who have mysteriously disappeared Parson Chowne a parson of demoniac wickedness and craft who works his will for many years in the north of Devon defying God man and the law and Captain Drake Bamfylde who is under suspicion of having made away with the children of his elder brother and heirs to the family property Old Davy gradually unravels the mystery and sets matters right although many distractions delay him including an extended period at sea in which Blackmore gives a graphic account of the Battle of the Nile
Publication
The Maid of Sker was serialized in Blackwood's Magazine from August 1871 to July 1872
It was then published as a three-volume novel in 1872
Reception
The novel received fairly good reviews The Saturday Review stated that the book is exceedingly able and strikingly original there is much powerful writing in it a great deal of dry humour with some touches of rare pathos The Spectator regarded it as in our opinion a genuine success one of the few good novels that has been written for many years although it also noted that it is here and there just a little difficult to follow the story must run over a course of years which it may tax even the author of Waverley to render interesting
Blackmore himself regarded this as his best novel both as an expression of his own personality and in point of workmanship

Quebec Charter of Values

The Quebec Charter of Values was a proposed bill in the Canadian province of Quebec introduced by the governing Parti Quebecois in 2013 trying to end the Quebec controversy on reasonable accommodation The former PQ cabinet member responsible for the bill was Bernard Drainville Minister responsible for Democratic Institutions and Active Citizenship There was much controversy in Quebec and elsewhere about the charter especially its proposed prohibition of public sector employees from wearing or displaying conspicuous religious symbols
The proposal would have included the following provisions
The bill died as of the 2014 election which was won by the Quebec Liberal Party Bill 60 was a contributing factor in the PQÅfs loss of power The Liberals were opposed to the legislation although party leader Philippe Couillard pledged during the campaign to put forward a different set of measures on the reasonable accommodation issue
Chronology
The proposal was first announced on May 22 2013
The Charter was officially proposed on September 10 2013
The bill died on the order paper as of March 5 2014
Symbols
The most controversial of all provisions seems to be about the restriction of the public sector employees from wearing or displaying conspicuous religious symbols
According to the bill relatively discreet items such as a finger ring earring or small pendants bearing a religious symbol will be allowed while more obvious items such as a kippah turban hijab niq?b and larger crosses and religious pendants would be prohibited
Elected politicians would be exempt and temporary opt-out provisions have been proposed for universities and hospitals Furthermore certain items and customs with an ostensibly religious nature such as the large crucifix on display in the Quebec National Assembly cultural heritage and observing Christmas are exempt on the rationale of them reflecting the province's cultural heritage This has led to the widespread belief that this measure is motivated by an act of ethnocentric hypocrisy
Reactions against
The charter was more popular in the beginning but the constant attacks have been able to reduce the support occasionally to 50% of the population
Quebec political parties
In Quebec itself the Provincial Official Opposition the Quebec Liberal Party enjoying an increase in support since the announcement of this Charter has declared that it will oppose the passing of this bill to the point of triggering an election over the issue Coalition Avenir Quebec leader Francois Legault proposed a compromise with a more limited ban with health care workers and daycare workers exempted
Former PQ premier Jacques Parizeau does not feel the end of the bill justifies its means
Federal political parties
The reaction to this bill has been divisive with most of the major Federal political parties denouncing this proposal For instance Justin Trudeau of the Liberal Party of Canada described this measure as a cynical wedge issue designed to foment conflict with the Federal Government of Canada to promote Quebec separatism when it is challenged in the courts as unconstitutional while Thomas Mulcair of the New Democratic Party of Canada declared it unacceptable deriding it while speaking to the press as state-sponsored discrimination Prime Minister Stephen Harper noted that the bill will likely not become law but will take whatever action necessary in the event that it does Member of Parliament Maria Mourani was expelled from the Bloc Quebecois for complaining that the proposed Charter is an act of political opportunism over human rights
Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse
Quebec's human rights commission the Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse has condemned the proposed charter as a radical infringement on fundamental rights
Other groups
The Canadian Civil Liberties Association submitted a brief to the Quebec National AssemblyÅfs Committee on Institutions They described Bill 60 as a profoundly disturbing law that would violate fundamental freedoms and cannot be justified in a free and democratic society as the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms requires CCLA posits that the Bill violates freedom of religion freedom of expression the right to equality and the right to be free from discrimination CCLA mentions inconsistencies in the law that would be disproportionate upon members minority faith traditions They urged the Quebec government to abandon the bill
The president of the Mouvement laique quebecois Lucie Jobin wrote that she is delighted that secularism is registered on it - it is a public value of social cohesion - but we express many reservations It would be a two-speed secularism
On November 13 Jewish General Hospital executive director Dr Lawrence Rosenberg called the proposed charter flawed and contrary to Quebec's spirit of inclusiveness and tolerance and said that the hospital would ignore it if passed in a written statement endorsed by the hospitalÅfs board of directors
On January 12 2014 an independent documentary Quebec 60 un documentaire was published on YouTube to counter the Quebec Charter of Values The documentary focuses on women who wear the veil and who live in the province of Quebec It also tackles the Charter's effects on other religious minorities the Sikh and the Jewish communities On its first week of release the online documentary gathered more than 18,000 views
On February 15 2014 an independent documentary La charte des distractions English the Charter of Distractions was published by a collective of independent media groups which consisted of G.A.P.P.A Les Alter Citoyens and 99%Media as a critical view and analysis of the Quebec Charter of Values and how it represented a distraction from the real social economic and environmental issues that have been further exacerbated by the successive austerity measures imposed by the Parti Quebecois and the Parti liberal du Quebec before it The documentary also drew parallels with what had happened a year earlier during the 2012 Quebec Maple spring protests The documentary also drew parallels with the Idle No More movement and the treatment of First Nations peoples The documentary was released openly to the public on YouTube and received significant media attention
Public reaction
The public reaction has included at least one public incident where a Quebec woman of Algerian origin wearing an Islamic veil was accosted in Laurier Quebec shopping centre in Quebec City by a woman citing the charter who demanded they change their religion and remove the headscarf Another incident occurred when a white male harassed a hijab-wearing woman on a bus in Montreal In response there have been at least two public protest marches in Montreal of people of various faiths denouncing the Charter There has also been at least two marches in support of the charter including the Janettes movement of women for laicity


Chimene

Chimene ou Le Cid is a French-language opera by Antonio Sacchini It takes the form of a tragedie lyrique in three acts with a libretto by Nicolas-Francois Guillard It was first staged at Fontainebleau on 16 November 1783 The subject of the work was inspired by the tragicomedy Le Cid by Pierre Corneille and indirectly by the medieval Spanish epic Cantar de Mio Cid and a play by Guillen de Castro y Bellvis Las Mocedades del Cid Comedia Comedia primera and segunda also known as Las Hazanas del Cid 1605-1615
Background
Antecedents
Sacchini had already dealt with the subject of El Cid twice before The first occasion was in Rome during the Carnival season of 1769 when under the title of Il Cidde he had set a libretto by Gioacchino Pizzi previously used by Niccolo Piccinni which retained its popularity for at least another decade The star of the work was the soprano castrato Tommaso Guarducci then at the height of his fame After he moved to London Sacchini returned to the subject for his English debut Il Cid 1773 using a reworking of Pizzi's libretto made by Giovanni Gualberto Bottarelli the official poet of the King's Theatre Il Cid included spectacular new scenes including a triumphal march choruses and ballets designed to maintain the interest of a public that knew little Italian The leading role was sung by another of the great castrati of the time Giuseppe Millico who on his return in Italy sponsored a second setting of the same libretto by Giovanni Paisiello in Florence in 1775
Sacchini moved from London to Paris in 1781 and made his debut at the Opera in January 1783 with Renaud For his second French opera he decided to return to the subject of the Cid this time with a new libretto entitled Chimene prepared for him by the man who was to become his favourite poet in Paris Nicolas-Francois Guillard Dennis Libby comments As might be expected this libretto has the closest resemblance to Corneille's tragedy while accommodating the French taste for choral singing and ballet According to Lajarte Chimene was to be precise a translation and not a new work while Pitou writes that it had been staged in Rome and London before its Paris premiere In fact the case of Chimene bears strong similarities to that of Renaud compared to Sacchini's previous Italian operas on the same theme Armida Milan and Florence 1772 and Rinaldo London 1780 Dennis Libby writes Notwithstanding frequent assertions to the effect that the French opera is based on music from the London one there appear to be no musical interrelationships of any substance among Sacchini's three Cid operas although since the London one does not survive complete unusually extensive excerpts were published this cannot be asserted with absolute certainty
Rivalry with Piccinni
The composition of Sacchini's second work for Paris must be placed in the context of the factional fighting which then dominated the French musical world a sort of reprise of the Querelle des Bouffons a couple of decades earlier Hostilities began in the mid-1770s the Italophile opponents of the German composer Gluck had managed to attract Piccinni one of the leading exponents of the Neapolitan school to Paris Piccinni was more or less the same age as Sacchini and indeed had been his fellow student and maybe even collaborator early in his career The battle between the two camps the Gluckists and the Piccinnists continued until 1779 when Gluck confronted with the failure of his final opera Echo et Narcisse had decided to return to Vienna for a while after which hostilities had continued to smoulder under the surface Sacchini's arrival in Paris in 1781 had been supported by Piccinni himself who saw him as a natural ally but the vacuum created by Gluck's absence the intrigues of Piccinni's enemies and Sacchini's touchiness and need for money had ended by making rivals of the two Italian composers and a third musical faction emerged on the Parisian scene the Sacchinists a sort of moderate Gluckists who as writer on music Grimm wittily remarked had only joined the new sect out of jealousy towards Piccinni With his indecisiveness and weakness Sacchini only succeeded in setting himself against both factions without endearing himself to either and when it came to a fight he found both of them against him
Performance history
Premiere at Fontainebleau
The Academie Royale the Paris Opera and the Comedie Italienne had been ordered to organise a joint opera season for the court in the autumn of 1783 at the palace of Fontainebleau A new work by Piccinni Didon had long been in preparation Sacchini was persuaded to hurry the composition of the second of the three works stipulated in his contract with the Opera As mentioned above he chose to take his subject from Corneille's tragedy Le Cid The two new operas were placed in direct competition Didon was to be performed on 16 October and Chimene on 16 November 1783 To level the playing field the new prima donna of the Opera Antoinette Saint-Huberty was to take the title role in both works and both pieces were due to have two performances each Didon probably Piccinni's masterpiece in the field of serious opera enjoyed a triumphant reception while Chimene was more of a succes d'estime and was performed only once because the king himself although he was no music lover wanted to hear Didon a third time I think this opera he said is as good as a beautiful tragedy Nevertheless both Piccinni and Sacchini were presented to the king and as he had just granted a pension of six thousand livres to the former the latter was given the same sum unlike his rival Sacchini also had the precious honour of being presented to the king by the queen herself
Paris performances
However the Parisian public did not always agree with the opinion of the court and many hoped Sacchini's work would be rescued by subsequent performances at the Opera then housed in the Salle du Theatre de la Porte Saint-Martin Indeed the prima donna Saint-Huberty herself had declared she had been ravished by the enchanting music Yet the opera was not fully redeemed and this cannot wholly be blamed on the specious difficulties created by the committee of the Academie Royale which postponed performances until 9 February 1784 in the meantime Didon had been appearing regularly since 1 December and Saint-Huberty was crowned on stage on 16 January Nor can it be blamed on the leading lady's health problems which forced the run of performances to be interrupted until 27 February when the Queen herself came to see it
The opera certainly enjoyed a limited long-term success it was given 21 times in 1784 and another 35 times before it was withdrawn from the repertoire for good in 1808 On the other hand Didon survived much longer until 1826 enjoying a grand total of 250 performances Didon has also been revived on stage in modern times and received a CD recording which has not been the case with Chimene
Synopsis
The scene is the court of Castile in the 11th century during the first phase of the Reconquista
Background
The libretto makes no reference to the background of the story which can be inferred from Corneille's tragedy The young warrior Rodrigue and the beautiful Chimene are in love with one other but their fathers are at odds over political issues When Chimene's father slaps Don Diegue the latter asks his son Rodrigue to fight a duel on his behalf as he is too old to defend his honour in person Rodrigue is torn between the conflicting demands of love and honour but in the end he obeys Don Diegue and fights and kills Chimene's father much to his despair
Act 1
Chimene is alone in a room in the palace and is torn apart by conflicting emotions love desire for revenge and honour But she vows to avenge her father Scene 1 The king enters and tries to console Chimene treating her as his own daughter he declares how fond he was of her dead father but also reveals the respect in which everyone holds Rodrigue the one man capable of leading the fight against the Moors Nevertheless the king promises to capture and punish her father's killer Scene 2 Left alone with her maids Chimene reveals her undying love for Rodrigue She adored him before the fatal duel and now that fate has divided them and all hope is dead their love still remains intact Nevertheless she says she will do what honour demands and the more she loves Rodrigue the more she will seek to punish him Scene 3 The next scene is taken up by a dramatic duet between Chimene and Rodrigue who has just arrived he begs her to kill him but she fails to follow through with her vow of revenge and the two are left in despair Scene 4 Alone again Rodrigue contemplates death Scene 5 until he is met by his father and his followers and asked to march against the army of the Moors which has just laid siege to the city If he is to die he should do so nobly for his king and country Encouraged by his father's words Rodrigue agrees to fight and the first act ends with a martial chorus Scene 6
Act 2
In the palace courtyard the common people fear the arrival of the Moors Scene 1 and the king tries to reassure them inviting them to seek refuge in the palace Suddenly unexpected shouts of victory are heard Scene 2 A herald enters and describes in detail the total defeat of the Moors leading behind him a band of captive enemies including two kings Scene 3 When the King of Castile asks who is responsible an officer tells him that Don Diegue wants to lead the victor into his presence in person The king realises that it is Rodrigue who is hailed as a saviour by everyone present Scene 4 Rodrigue is then introduced by his father and welcomed into the arms of the king Rodrigue says that driven to despair by the tragedy that has divided him from Chimene he had sought an honourable death in battle The king tries to console him suggesting that Chimene ? who is still in love with him ? might have second thoughts about her revenge given the valour her beloved has just shown The scene ends in choruses and dances of victory during which Rodrigue is proclaimed El Cid Scene 5 As the celebrations end Chimene reappears Having learned of Rodrigue's exploits she fears she will now fail to achieve her revenge In fact the king wants to declare Rodrigue above the law but the other knights are opposed offering to take up the challenge on her behalf against the Cid in a trial by combat It is also opposed by Don Diegue who in the name of honour urges his son to fight for the umpteenth time The king yields to the majority opinion and allows Chimene to accept the offer of Don Sanche another knight who is in love with her to represent her in combat To Chimene's consternation the king nevertheless sets one condition she must accept the hand of the victor in marriage Scene 7 The common people left alone sing a chorus of support for the Cid Scene 8
Act 3
Dishevelled and restless Chimene enters followed by Elvire and her other ladies She is in despair about the terrible choice she has been forced to make but she strongly believes Rodrigue can never be defeated in combat Rodrigue arrives to say goodbye for the last time and tells her that he will never dare to raise his sword against anyone who fights in her name He will let himself be killed with no fear for his honour people will only say that conquered by Chimene and with no hope of changing her mind he had preferred to die rather than live with the burden of her hatred Chimene begs Rodrigue to avoid falling prey to Don Sanche because she cannot bear the prospect of Sanche's bloodstained hand taking hers in marriage She urges him to remember that she will be the prize of the winner Reassured by his beloved's words Rodrigue leaves declaring his desire for victory Scene 2 Left alone with her entourage while the trumpets announcing the duel are heard in the distance Chimene performs a mad scene in which she believes she is seeing the events of the fight and faints in the arms of her ladies as she imagines Rodrigue mortally wounded Scene 3 Don Sanche enters bearing Rodrigue's sword but he is prevented from speaking by the curses of Chimene who calls him a hateful murderer Scene 4 The king appears with his entourage and Chimene throws herself at his feet confessing her unchanging love for the slain Rodrigue and begging him to spare her the shame of having to marry the man who is guilty of his death But the king is adamant and declares that any resistance on the part of the girl is in vain inviting her to willingly accept the groom he will give her today Scene 5 Rodrigue then enters he had defeated Don Sanche but he had spared his life sending him instead to offer Chimene the conqueror's sword and he now asks her to accept him as husband of her own free will and not by right of conquest Chimene finally won over surrenders to her love and the work ends with the customary final divertissement with songs and dances in honour of the conqueror of the Moors and his bride Scene 6

Xia Yeliang born 1960 is a former untenured associate professor of economics at Peking University He was one of the early drafters and signers of Charter 08 in 2008 In June 2013 he was given notice by a Communist party official at the School of Economics that a faculty vote regarding termination of his position at the university was scheduled He was dismissed in October 2013 PKU issued an announcement afterwards claiming In recent years Xia's teaching evaluations has been consistently the lowest of the whole School of Economics The school has received more than 340 student complaints since 2006 The hiring and promotion committee voted against the renewal of his contract on Oct 26 2012 As a courtesy the school gave Xia one year extension for possible improvement On Oct 11 2013 the committee voted again 34 out of 37 members showed up 3 voted yes 1 abstained and 30 voted no The school therefore terminated the contract
Although media said that the complaints contained allegations that Xia gave anti-Party and anti-socialism speeches in class the School has not made public the teaching evaluations or any other verifiable information regarding the evaluation process In media interviews Xia has claimed he has not been allowed to see the student evaluation instruments and that it is impossible therefore to determine if there is any factual basis for the claims made against him by the School of Economics
Xia called on supporters to contact universities across the country and suggest that he be given an administrative position in a library something that Xia argued should not present a difficulty if his termination was solely based on student dissatisfaction and not politically motivated
Xia a supporter of democracy and human rights has been outspoken in the past going so far as to directly criticize Liu Yunshan director of the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China with respect to censorship and asking him how he thinks he has the power to control other people's thoughts Liu is now a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China the top leadership of the People's Republic of China
Xia was a visiting scholar at Stanford during the summer of 2013 and visited Wellesley College during August Wellesley faculty have strongly rallied to his support According to Xia he has been pressured for years by university officials to keep quiet about his views and has been followed routinely by security personnel Nevertheless in 2013 Xia expressed surprise regarding the upcoming faculty vote Xia and a few others are believed to be targets of a campaign underway since May 2013 to suppress 7 categories of information

Balcombe Place

Balcombe Place is a Grade II Listed Building built in 1856 in West Sussex with a south view across the Ouse Valley It now forms part of The Balcombe Estate
The architect was Henry Clutton It was built for John Alexander Hankey whose family had been living at Naylands a house about 1 mile away The Gentleman's Magazine in 1864 refers to a meeting where Ågmembers adjourned to Balcombe Place a residence recently erected by John Alexander Hankey Esq who hospitably entertained themÅh
The main living area was connected to the servant's areas a rear courtyard and stables A photograph in 1897 shows a tall large glass and wood conservatory on the east side By the 1960s that structure had fallen in disrepair and had either been demolished on purpose or had simply fallen down Images in 2013 suggested it was overgrown but still protected by walls on each side and probably still growing plants from earlier plantings Descriptions refer to the Denmans lawn tennis courts but their location is unclear No courts are shown in the 1910 OS map a hard court existed in the 1960s and appears in the 1974 OS map At 2013 the OS and Google Earth show the hard court to have gone
Early maps show wooded areas around the main building but with a generally unobstructed view to the south By the 1960s some trees to the east and south had been removed This may have occurred during the war years or when the land was used as a school but may have been arranged beforehand by Lady Denman who recorded bonfires as a hobby and was once described as indiscriminately lopping trees
Early history
Balcombe parish lay within the original precincts of the Forest of Worth In the reign of Edward I William de Warenne held the area and it probably descended as the Barony of Lewes and the Borde-Hill and Spelice families of Nayland In 1860 the principal estate in the parish was Nayland now Balcombe Place Nayland passed respectively through the Michelborne Culpeper or Culpepper Spence Liddel or Liddell Clitherow and Chatfield families who sold it to J.A Hankey Esq High Sheriff of Sussex in 1866 Hankey erected Balcombe Place in the Tudor style on a commanding spot near the ancient house
1899 additions
In 1899 a music room also described as a ballroom was added to the building with designs by the architect G C Horsley Reynaldo Hahn wrote that he completed La Cimetiere de campagne at Balcombe Place The room integrated a large electrically powered organ with its motor in a small basement room and with organ pipes and a small choir or minstral's gallery
The work also included additions to the garden front The 1910 Ordnance Survey map shows the new Music Room but also shows a pond in the front garden with a fountain By 1955 the fountain was removed and the remaining pond was used sometimes as a swimming pool but is now filled in and contains plants A ha-ha is added to separate fields of livestock from the domestic lands
Cowdray Estate
In 1905 it was purchased along with the 3,000-acre Balcombe Estate by Weetman Pearson 1st Viscount Cowdray for his daughter Gertrude upon her marriage to the 3rd Baron Denman The couple went in Australia in 1911 but returned three years later due to Lord Denman's hay fever It was not an unusual thing for him to retire to the cool of cellars of the house where he would spend hours there reading Lady Denman enjoyed golf and laid a course where the ninth hole was right up against the plate glass windows of the dining room so that her guests were never brave enough to hit the ball properly In 1913 an electrically operated water pump 300 gallons per minute was installed
During World War II the building became the headquarters of the Women's Land Army There are no known publicly viewable photographs of this huge operation Personal accounts describe the influx of administrative workers tables desks and office supplies and stables containing WLA uniforms and otber distributable goods The tennis courts became used for livestock
In 1954 following the death of Lady Denman the building was leased to a school on a 21-year lease Ownership of the building and the estates remain within the family
Schools
In 1955 Mr Geoffrey Teale transferred and renamed his existing school Whispers in Wadhurst to Balcombe Place Balcombe Place School was a Roman Catholic preparatory school for 50 boys aged 6 to 14 Teale retired in 1969 Another Sussex school Bishop Sutton run by Mr Kevin Botting moved into Balcombe Place which merged with the existing school In their final year the pupils were trained for passing the Common Entrance examination to qualify for entrance to Independent Public Schools The 21-year lease ended in 1976
Notable Alumni
Possible demolition
Unfavourable changes in Capital Gains tax and the ongoing maintenance costs for Country houses encouraged some owners to sell or demolish their buildings The owners of Balcombe Place applied It was refused and it became a Listed building in April 1977 The building had its original plumbing system old and inefficient heating and wiring from the 1930s It was Ågunoccupied and in a fast deteriorating conditionÅh Damage from vandalism included organ pipes ripped out and some of the Spanish leather panels were torn
Later history
It was advertised in Business magazines as a location for meetings training courses or conferences It was described as having 16 bedroom suites and meeting rooms holding up to 70 people
In 1976 the owners successfully converted the derelict stables into offices renovating and restoring as much of the existing structure as possible with no serious structural alterations and no extensions or demolition Since the late 1980s the Building has been used as a care home In 2006 further alterations were made to the old stable block The squash court's viewing gallery was enlarged and doors were added on the ground floor In 2008 the original narrow staircase in the Squash court which had led to a viewing gallery was removed


Social Democratic Party UK

The Social Democratic Party SDP was a centrist political party in the United Kingdom that was founded on 26 March 1981 and existed until 1988 It was founded by four senior Labour Party moderates dubbed the Gang of Four Roy Jenkins David Owen Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams At the time of the SDP's creation Owen and Rodgers were sitting Labour Members of Parliament MPs Jenkins had left Parliament in 1977 to serve as President of the European Commission while Williams had lost her seat in the 1979 general election The four left the Labour Party as a result of policy changes enacted at the January 1981 Wembley conference which committed the party to unilateral nuclear disarmament and withdrawal from the European Economic Community They also believed that Labour had become too left-wing and had been allegedly infiltrated at constituency party level by Trotskyist factions whose views and behaviour they considered to be at odds with the Parliamentary Labour Party and Labour voters
For the 1983 and 1987 General Elections the SDP formed a political and electoral alliance with the Liberal Party known as the SDP?Liberal Alliance After a ballot of members and the passing of a motion at the 1987 Portsmouth conference the party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988 to form a unified party known as the Liberal Democrats initially the Social and Liberal Democrats although a minority left to form a continuing SDP led by David Owen
History
Origins
The origin of the party can be traced back to the ideological divisions in the Labour Party in the 1950s with its forerunner being the Campaign for Democratic Socialism established to support the Gaitskellites but publicly lies in the 1979 Dimbleby Lecture given by Roy Jenkins as he neared the end of his presidency of the European Commission Jenkins argued the necessity for a realignment in British politics and discussed whether this could be brought about from within the existing Liberal Party or from a new group driven by European principles of social democracy
There were long-running claims of corruption and administrative decay within Labour at local level the North-East of England was to become a cause celebre and concerns that experienced and able Labour MPs could be deselected i.e lose the Labour Party nomination by those wanting to put into a safe seat their friends family or members of their own Labour faction In some areas the Militant tendency were held to be systematically targeting weak local party branches in safe seat areas in order to have their own candidates selected and thus become MPs
Eddie Milne at Blyth Northumberland and Dick Taverne in Lincoln were both victims of such intrigues during the 1970s but in both cases there was enough of a local outcry by party members ? and the electorate ? for them to fight and win their seats as independent candidates against the official Labour candidates
March 1973 Lincoln by-election
In Taverne's case he had been fighting efforts by the Lincoln Constituency Labour Party to deselect him largely over his support for British membership of the European Communities In October 1972 he resigned his seat to force a by-election in which he fought as a Democratic Labour candidate against the official party candidate Taverne won by an unexpectedly large margin He founded the short lived Campaign for Social Democracy CFSD thereafter and wrote a book about events surrounding the by-election called The Future of the Left ? Lincoln and After 1972 But the CFSD failed to gain nationwide support and Taverne lost the seat at the October 1974 General Election Some independent Social Democrats contested the October 1974 and 1979 General Elections but none were elected
Taverne's Lincoln by-election campaign was also helped to a lesser degree by problems with the Conservative and Unionist Party candidate Conservative Monday Club chairman Jonathan Guinness His suggestion during the by-election that murderers should have razor blades left in their cells so they could decently commit suicide resulted in him being nicknamed Old Razor Blades during the campaign This combined with considerable Conservative grassroots disquiet over the Monday Club's links to the National Front persuaded some Conservative voters to switch to Taverne in protest as much as tactically to ensure Labour suffered an embarrassing loss Guinness had been elected as Chairman specifically to eradicate such links
The Manifesto Group and the split from Labour
Many original members of the future Social Democratic Party had been members of The Manifesto Group within the Labour Party This group opposed what they saw as a leftward shift in Labour policy the increasing prominence within the party of Tony Benn and the involvement of trade unions in choosing the leader of the Labour Party They argued that a new type of political force was needed to challenge the Conservative Party Further they opposed the creation of an electoral college to elect the leader of the Party who had previously been elected by members of the Parliamentary Labour Party ? in particular the arrangement of block voting by constituency parties and trade unions with the total votes of a Constituency Labour Party CLP or trade union being given to a candidate based on a first-past-the-post within that CLP or union or changed at the discretion of delegates similar to primary elections in the United States They were also vehemently opposed to unilateral nuclear disarmament an increasingly popular policy amongst members of the party
The final straw for many in the Manifesto Group was the behaviour of former Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey at a meeting with them during the Labour leadership campaign to replace James Callaghan He bluntly told those assembled to vote for him and answered their questions uninformatively At the end one asked him why they should vote for him and Healey answered You have nowhere else to go to stop the left-winger Michael Foot from winning Healey's arrogance convinced many that their days as members of the Labour Party were now over Ivor Crewe and Anthony King found five defectors who claimed to have voted for Foot in order to saddle Labour with an unelectable leader and make life easier in their new party One defector Mike Thomas said he was tempted to send a telegraph to Healey reading Have found somewhere else to go
Newspapers of the period reported that the announcement of the new party came as a complete shock to MPs from all sides of the Commons including members of the Manifesto Group as the Gang of Four had kept their preparations a closely guarded secret One notable Manifesto Group exception was its secretary future Defence Secretary George Robertson who was the only officer to remain The story got around that he had refused to join the new party because he feared he would not be able to keep his Hamilton seat at a general election local Scottish National Party supporters nicknamed him Chicken George
Creation of the SDP
The founding members or Gang of Four were Roy Jenkins David Owen Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams all leading figures within the Labour Party and all moderates They announced the new party at a press conference in 1981 after outlining their policies in what became known as the Limehouse Declaration
Democratic Democratic Labour and Radical were all mentioned as possible names for the new party as well as New Labour which future Labour leader Tony Blair would use to promote the Labour Party more than a decade later but eventually Social Democratic was settled on because the Gang of Four consciously wanted to mould the philosophy and ideology of the new party on the Social Democracy practised on mainland Europe
The opening statement of principles contained in the preamble of the party's constitution stated that The SDP exists to create and defend an open classless and more equal society which rejects prejudices based upon sex race colour or religion The constitution set out the establishment of a Council for Social Democracy CSD which was in effect the party's standing conference Each area party was entitled to elect delegates to the CSD A number of internal groups flourished within the new party the most notable of which was the Tawney Society mirroring the function of the Fabian Society within the Labour Party
Twenty-eight Labour MPs eventually joined the new party along with one member of the Conservative Party Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler Williams and Jenkins were not at the time MPs but were elected to the Commons in by-elections at Crosby and Glasgow Hillhead respectively Much of the party's initial membership came from the Social Democratic Alliance The party also received a boost with the recruitment of former student leaders from outside the Labour Party These included former Communist Party of Great Britain member Sue Slipman as well as Conservative party members including Adair Turner Anna Soubry and Tom Hayhoe
Although the SDP was seen as being largely a breakaway from the right wing of the Labour Party an internal party survey found that 60% of its members had not belonged to a political party before with 25% being drawn from Labour 10% from the Conservatives and 5% from the Liberals
The party enjoyed a considerable honeymoon period with the press who made much mileage out of their quirk for proffering claret at their functions Claret is an agreeable wine and a metaphor for the party's harmonious internal relations compared to those of the strife-torn Labour Party of the period
The policies of the SDP emphasised a middle position between perceived extremes of Thatcherism and the Labour Party Its constitution argued for the fostering of a strong public sector and a strong private sector without frequent frontier changes The SDP favoured some neoliberal Thatcherite reforms during the 1980s such as legislation aimed at reforming the trade unions although the parliamentary SDP actually split three ways on Norman Tebbit's 1982 Industrial Relations bill most voting for some against and others abstaining but took a more welfarist position than the Conservative Party being more sceptical of Conservative welfare reforms particularly regarding the Health Service
At the party's first electoral contest Jenkins narrowly failed to win a by-election at Warrington in July 1981 describing it as his first defeat but by far his greatest victory In the Glasgow Hillhead by-election in March 1982 another candidate called Douglas Parkin nominated by a party called the Social Democratic Party which had been formed in Manchester in 1979 changed his name to Roy Harold Jenkins to contest the seat SDP polling agents were given special dispensation by the Returning Officer to have placards outside of polling stations to state which one on the ballot papers was the real Roy Ultimately the SDP's Jenkins was elected
A leadership election was held later in the year Jenkins beating Owen in the ballot to become the first party leader Later in the year Shirley Williams defeated Bill Rodgers in the ballot to become SDP president
The Alliance
The SDP formed the SDP?Liberal Alliance with the Liberal Party late in 1981 under the joint leadership of Roy Jenkins SDP and Liberal leader David Steel The Liberal Party and in particular its leader David Steel had applauded the formation of the SDP from the sidelines from the very start Senior Liberal MP for Rochdale Cyril Smith caused some embarrassment however by publicly stating that the SDP should be strangled at birth During an era of public disillusionment with the two main parties ? Labour and the Conservatives ? and widescale unemployment the Alliance achieved considerable success in parliamentary by-elections At one point in late 1981 the party had an opinion poll rating of over 50%
Also in 1981 David Steel was able to address the Liberal Party conference with the phrase Go back to your constituencies and prepare for government
In early 1982 after public disagreements over who could fight which seats in the forthcoming election the poll rating dipped but the party remained ahead of both Labour and the Conservatives However following the outbreak of the Falklands War on 2 April 1982 the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher soared from third to first place in the public opinion polls The standing of the SDP?Liberal Alliance and Labour Party declined By this stage however the SDP?Liberal Alliance already 30 MPs in parliament - virtually all of them defectors from Labour joined by just the one Tory MP
Labour lost Bermondsey one of their ten safest seats in a by-election in February 1983 to Liberal candidate Simon Hughes the sitting Labour MP Robert Mellish resigned to work for the London Docklands Development Corporation but being opposed to the selection by his left-wing Constituency Labour Party of Peter Tatchell supported the former leader of Southwark council John O'Grady as Real Bermondsey Labour giving an impression of Labour division and infighting
In the 1983 general election the SDP?Liberal Alliance won more than 25% of the national vote close behind Labour's 28% but well behind the 44% secured by the Conservatives However because of the first-past-the-post electoral system used in the United Kingdom only 23 Alliance MPs were elected six of whom were members of the SDP The party's leader Roy Jenkins managed to hold his seat at Glasgow Hillhead but SDP President Shirley Williams was defeated at Crosby which she had won in a by-election in November 1981 as a result of unfavourable boundary changes Labour leader Michael Foot who resigned within days of the election was critical of the SDP?Liberal Alliance for siphoning support away from Labour allowing the Conservatives to win more seats and secure a triple-digit majority while Labour was left with 209 seats in parliament
The MP for Plymouth Devonport Dr David Owen who had been a Labour government minister under Harold Wilson and James Callaghan between 1974 and 1979 took over as SDP leader after the 1983 General Election He was more sceptical about close relations with the Liberals than his predecessor Roy Jenkins and favoured retaining the party's distinct identity Owen's influence ensured that proposals for a merger between the two parties were shelved after a lengthy debate at the SDP's 1983 Conference
During the 1983-87 parliament some SDP members started to become unsettled at what appeared to be the increasingly right wing course taken by SDP leader David Owen This resulted in some members launching the Limehouse Group in an attempt to keep the party on the centre-left course that was first propounded in the Limehouse Declaration
Two more SDP MPs were elected in by-elections during the 1983-87 parliament but in the 1987 general election the Alliance's share of the vote fell to 23% and the SDP's parliamentary party was reduced from eight members to five Roy Jenkins was amongst those who lost their seats Mike Hancock had won a by-election at Portsmouth South in 1984 from the Conservatives which was lost in 1987 but Rosie Barnes who had won the bitterly contested Greenwich by-election in February 1987 from Labour managed to hold on in the June General Election
From the outset the formation of the Alliance had raised questions as to whether it would lead to a merged party or the two parties were destined to compete with each other This in turn led to grassroots tensions in some areas between Liberal and SDP branches that impaired their ability to mount joint campaigns successfully Such cross-party feuding was part of the reason for Jenkins losing his Hillhead seat to Labour candidate George Galloway in 1987
Liberal pride was damaged by the sustained lampooning of the Alliance by ITV's Spitting Image puppet comedy programme portraying Steel as the craven lickspittle of Owen One Spitting Image sketch had a Machiavellian Owen proposing to a simpering Steel that the parties merged under a new name and for our side we'll take Social Democratic and from your side we'll take ÅeParty to which a hesitant Steel agreed
Merger disestablishment and splits
After the disappointment of 1987 Steel proposed a formal merger of the two parties Jenkins and Steel had believed this to be eventually inevitable after the party failed to break through at the 1983 election The proposal also supported by Williams and Rodgers was fiercely opposed by Owen who argued that such a merger would not be accepted by the electorate and would not reverse their declining share of the vote Jenkins denied that a merger had been his original intent
But the majority of the SDP's membership along with those of the Liberals voted in favour of the union Owen resigned as leader and was replaced by Robert Maclennan Steel and Maclennan headed the new Social and Liberal Democrats party from 3 March 1988 An interim working name for the party the Democrats was adopted by conference on 26 September 1988 This proved to be unpopular and the party was renamed the Liberal Democrats in October 1989 as had been originally proposed at the September 1988 conference by the party's Tiverton branch
Most SDP members including SDP MP and future Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy joined Maclennan in the merged party but Owen created a continuing SDP along with two other MPs John Cartwright and Rosie Barnes This party performed poorly at the May 1990 by-election in Bootle behind the Monster Raving Lunatic Party It subsequently disbanded although a third SDP was formed and continues to operate as of November 2014 though on a much less influential scale There was also a continuing Liberal Party led by Michael Meadowcroft and David Morrish mainly based on Liverpool and West Country Liberals who feared a dilution by the former SDP members of the Liberal tradition within the merged party
Aftermath
Most members of the SDP who joined the Liberal Democrats have remained in that party There have been a few exceptions to this with Roger Liddle and Polly Toynbee among those former Labour Party members of the SDP who returned to Labour ranks subsequently Roger Liddle went on to become Special Adviser on European matters to Tony Blair and Chairman of the international think tank Policy Network in which capacity he has had a major influence on modernising the political philosophy of the Labour Party Some Owenites joined the Conservative Party with one Danny Finkelstein becoming a close aide of both John Major and William Hague
But most important of all the Social Democratic Party strengthened the political credibility of the Liberals The national status of Roy Jenkins former Chancellor and Home Secretary and David Owen former Foreign Secretary who had been widely tipped as a future Labour Prime Minister helped the Liberals become something more than a source of shock by-election results and a party for those living in rural areas such as the Scottish Highlands and the West Country The SDP also helped the Liberals attract attention from the media for their policies after a long period when the only media interest in the party resulted from the trial of former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe

Proletarian nation

Proletarian nation was a term used by 20th century Italian nationalist intellectuals such as Enrico Corradini and later adopted by Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini to refer to Italy and other poorer countries that were subordinate to the western imperialist powers These powers were described by Mussolini as Plutocratic Nations nazioni plutocratiche Corradini associated the proletariat with the economic function of production and believed that the producers should be at the forefront of a new imperialist proletarian nation Mussolini considered that the military struggles unfolding in Europe in the mid-20th century could have revolutionary consequences that could lead to an improvement in the position of Italy in comparison with the major imperialist powers such as Britain
Nazism rejected the Marxist concept of internationalist class struggle it identified class struggle between nations and sought to resolve internal class struggle in the nation while it identified Germany as a proletarian nation fighting against plutocratic nations
Origins
Two prominent concepts promoted by Corradini inspired fascism Corradini's theory of war as revolution and his theory of proletarian nationalism Though Corradini opposed revolutionary socialism in Italy for its anti-patriotism anti-militarism internationalism and its advocacy of class conflict he and other nationalists admired its revolutionary and conquering spirit and in a 1910 meeting of the Italian Nationalist Association declared support for proletarian nationalism saying
ÅgWe are the proletarian people in respect to the rest of the world Nationalism is our socialism This established nationalism must be founded on the truth that Italy is morally and materially a proletarian nation.Åh Manifesto of the Italian Nationalist Association December 1910
A similar conception was invoked in Germany during World War I by Johann Plenge who advocated a National Socialism and described the war as being between a proletarian Germany versus a capitalist Britain
Use of the concept and development
The concept was used by Mussolini from before the second world war until the end of his life The term indicated not only the difference between fascism and capitalism but also between communism and fascism
Taking again the nationalist doctrines before the March on Rome Mussolini set up in supreme value the ideas of Georges Sorel on the role of violence in the history and on the revolutionary trade unionism of action and the mobilizing idea of what Mussolini called Italy Åglarge proletarianÅh against the pluthocratic nations was one of the initiative that developed the concept
Nazi official and head of the German Labour Front Robert Ley in 1940 described Germany as a proletarian nation During their retirement of the Nazi Party Gregor Strasser and his brother Otto Strasser identified Germany as the first proletarian nation in the world and declared that Germany would need to ally itself with the other proletarian nations

Early life
His mother was Mavis Pat aged 16 years and his father was Len Walley about 36 who were married under traditional Aboriginal law The eldest of three children he lived with his family at the Mount Florence pastoral station until the age of nine He attended the local high school for two years and left into a life of unemployment drunkenness disorderly conduct and conflict with police He received five minor convictions and was a regular inmate of the Roebourne Lockup on drunk charges
Arrest and death
On 28 September 1983 Pat and other young Aborigines engaged in a fight with an Aboriginal police aide and three off-duty police officers outside the Roebourne Hotel Pat was reportedly injured in the fight striking his head on the road and being kicked in the head and face He was arrested and taken to the lockup where he died soon after of closed head injuries in the juvenile police cell
Inquest
A coronial inquest was conducted on 30 October 1983 at which five police officers declined to give evidence The coroner Mr McCann committed the five officers for trial in the Supreme Court on a charge of unlawful killing
Trial
The five police officers were tried on counts of manslaughter in the Supreme Court in Karratha in May 1984 before a judge and an all-white jury The trial lasted for just over three weeks with the jury acquitting each officer by a unanimous verdict
Aftermath
The Police Commissioner monitored the trial instructing the attendance of a senior officer Brian Bull to independently review the proceedings Mr Bull was of the view that none of the officers had done anything wrong except falsely noting the Occurrence Book The five officers were immediately reinstated to duty and no further charges were considered against them?which was described by the Royal Commissioner Elliott Johnston QC as a most unsatisfactory state of affairs
The Police Union succeeded in obtaining government reimbursement of $136,000 costs in representing its members at the inquest and trial It also campaigned successfully against legislation to give the state's ombudsman increased powers to investigate police misconduct allegations and sought to weaken or abolish the Aboriginal Legal Service
The not-guilty verdict has always been bitterly disputed by the Aboriginal community and human-rights advocates Pat's death is commemorated annually in Australia and a public monument has been established at Fremantle Prison featuring a poem by Jack Davis that includes the words Write of life / the pious said<br>
forget the past / the past is dead.<br>
But all I see / in front of me<br>
is a concrete floor / a cell door / and John Pat

Cunnilingus in Halacha

Within the guidelines of halacha as presented by chazal and early rabbinic authorities Oral-vaginal stimulation in Halacha also known as ????? ???? ???? lit kissing of that place is the discussion of whether or not a man may orally stimulate his wife's vagina cunnilingus independent of whether this stimulation does or does not result in her achieving orgasm
The discussion is within the exclusive framework of a halachically permitted marital relationship and only during the time that one's wife is not in her Niddah state
Chazalic views
Talmud Bavli nedarim p.?20a quotes the majority of rabbis who disagree with the fringe view of Yohanan Ben Dahabai who are lenient by stating that all that man desires to do with his wife he may provided she agrees The talmud goes on to bring a parable of a man who makes a meat or fish purchase that he may cook his purchase in that way he desires
In a varying text of kallah rabthi as printed in battei medrashoth Rabbi Werthheimer notes the significance of the Talmud quoting both meat and fish in its parable
Since the Torah forbids cooking one's meat in milk a parable quoting just meat would not suffice as meat has this restrictive element whereas fish has a lesser restrictive element thus implying that man has an enhanced level of sexual freedom with his wife
The Rambam takes a somewhat lenient approach that permits oral-vaginal stimulation but at the same time discourages its actual practice
During ovulation
As stringent view of oral-vaginal stimulation when a woman may conceive is presented in Kallah Rabthi one of the Minor tractate in the name of Rabbah
Regarding the Kohen
The Sifthei Kohen vol 2 p.?244 commentary to the Torah points out that the kohen personality is to be extra-scrupulous with oral-vaginal stimulation of his wife when producing offspring as per Rabbi Yochanan's ben Dhabai's warning that it may cause a physical blemish were his wife to conceive as a kohen is bounded by the Torah rules of kohanic disqualifications and may be disqualified from specific Bet HaMikdash services if he has a physical blemish
Views of the Achronim
Shulchan Aruch Orach Hayyim ch 240 takes a stringent view of oral-vaginal stimulation by stating that the transgressor violates the spirit of the Torah verses of ????? ??? Thou shalt walk humbly -Micha 6:8 and ????? ???? ????? ?? ????? ????? ????? So that fear of God should be on your faces so that you should not sin -Exodus 9:16 and of ?? ????? ?? ???????? Thou should not make your soul despicable Leviticus 20:25
Leniencies
The Remah"s glosses to Shulchan Aruch Even HaEzer ch 25 take a more lenient on oral-vaginal stimulation as does Rabbi Yoel Sirkus the Bach who permit it in accordance with halacha but nonetheless discourage its practice
Rabbi A Arbel in his work Ba'athi Legani points out that the Rambam disagrees that oral-vaginal stimulation violates the spirit of the verse of ?? ????? as the average person ? during sexual excitement ? is not disgusted at the notion of orally stimulating the vagina
A similar point of view is written by Rabbi Blumenkrants who states that the Remah Chelkath Mechokek and the Aruch HaShulchan all agree that one may do with his wife as one desires ? including oral-vaginal stimulation ? as this is not punishable according to bare-basic halahcha


Maloren

Maloren is an island in the Kalix archipelago of northern Sweden It lies to the southwest of Sandskar but is not part of the Haparanda Archipelago National Park Maloren has the shape of an atoll with sandbanks around an inland sea It came into existence about 1,500 years ago when the area began to rise by per century Since 1997 the island has been a nature reserve encompassing On the island is a chapel built in 1769 and a lighthouse built in 1851
History
The island attracted fishermen in the 1600s and 1700s especially from the Finnish side of the nearby border Attracted by the herring fisherman came from Tornea and from Karlo in Ostrobothnia setting up two separate communities on the island with up to 200 people living there during the summer A pole marker was set up in 1725 and ten years later made into a beacon a painted marker that functions like a lighthouse but has no light Fishing became very productive during the second half of the 18th century when ten percent of the catch used to be donated to the priest in Tornea As result of the island's prosperity in 1768 a chapel was established there on the orders of the magistrate of Tornea With its tall spire it became known as Skargardens domkyrka cathedral of the islands
Maloren became a pilot station in 1827 In 1851 a tall lighthouse was built the first to be designed by Gustaf von Heidenstam A somewhat smaller lighthouse was built in 1891 to save manpower however this newer tower was closed down in about 1910 and the older one again placed in service now with a gas-powered light the keepers were withdrawn at the same time and pilots took over their maintenance When telephone service arrived in 1932 the pilot station was combined with that on another island Erikoren and Maloren no longer had a pilot living there year-round In 1958 the lighthouse was replaced with a Dalen light
The first dock was not constructed on the island until 1929 To assist with launching the pilot boat when the wind was in a difficult direction there used to be rails from the north to the south side of the island the boat was pulled on a trolley to where it could more conveniently be launched A concrete harbour was built over four years in the 1950s but had to be abandoned in 1967 because of erosion The harbour can be accessed at its easterly breakwater in a calm sea by boats with a draft up to although this can change due to the on-going deposition of sediment on the sea floor Other parts of the harbour are completely filled with rocks and sand that have been brought in with the tide Line markers fixed with lights on the outer leading line fitted with white light provide the navigation guide to boats The inner line is fitted with red lights and the harbor is sheltered from southerly gales When very strong southerly/south-westerly winds are blowing the harbor approach is difficult The old Swedish ÅgDomanverketÅh wooden jetty now known as ÅgSveaskogÅh was rebuilt in the middle of the 1970s
Geography
Maloren Island is situated in the Gulf of Bothnia situated approximately from the coast of Sweden Kalix is away towards the coast The horseshoe-shaped island is about in length The lie of the land is flat with a submarine gully recorded extending approximately in a northwesterly direction The island was declared a nature reserve in 1997 and titled ÅgNature 2000Åh covering an area of Seismic profiling has confirmed that the Muhos formation encompasses Bothnian Bay
Landmarks
Two important landmarks on the island are the Maloren Lighthouse and the chapel The island also has a labyrinth a wreck and debris of a navigation marker dated to 1725
The existing Maloren Lighthouse was established in 1851 and re-activated between 1891-1910 Its octagonal shaped wood-shingled tower is tapered and measures in height It is fitted with lantern and gallery with a focal plane height of The light flashes twice every 12 seconds in White-Red-Green While the tower is painted red the lantern dome is in white colour The lighthouse is under the jurisdiction of the Swedish National Property Board
As a result of economic progress of the island due to fishing operations a church was established here at the orders of the magistrate of Tornea town The octagonal wooden chapel was initially known as Prince Karl's fishing church It was erected in 1768 and was later given a shingled roof this was a popular church style around Bothnian Bay at the time Because of its tall spire the church also functioned as a navigational marker for seafaring vessels Still functional Sunday services are held there during the summer
Wildlife
Since 1997 Maloren has been a nature reserve covering 182 hectares 450 acres Vegetation on the rock-strewn island is reported to be gradually increasing Mountain ash are taking root and there are plenty of sea peas tufted vetch and fireweed Rarer species include sleepy primrose and southern adderstongue The island is even more interesting for birdlife located as it is at the south end of the archipelago It is used both as a resting place and for nesting Arctic terns abound but there are also black-legged kittiwakes Arctic skuas large and small plovers ruddy turnstones and redshanks as well as many of species of gull

China?Kazakhstan border

The China?Kazakhstan border or the Sino-Kazakhstan border is the international border between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Kazakhstan The border line between the two countries has been largely inherited from the border existing between the USSR and the PRC and earlier between the Russian Empire and the Qing Empire however it has been fully demarcated only in the late 20th and early 21st century According to the international boundary commissions that have carried out the border demarcation the border is 1782.75?km long
History
The origins of the border line between China and Kazakhstan date from the mid-19th century when the Russian empire was able to establish its control over the Lake Zaysan region The establishment of the border between the Russian Empire and the Qing Empire not too different from today's Sino-Kazakh border was provided for in the Convention of Peking of 1860 the actual border line pursuant to the convention was drawn by the Protocol of Chuguchak 1864 leaving Lake Zaysan on the Russian side The Qing Empire's military presence in the Irtysh basin crumbled during the Dungan revolt 1862?77 After the fall of the rebellion and the reconquest of Xinjiang by Zuo Zongtang the border between the Russian and the Qing empires in the Irtysh basin was further slightly readjusted in Russia's favor by the Treaty of Saint Petersburg 1881
After the Xinhai Revolution and the Chinese Civil War and China and the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War in Russia the Sino-Russian border became the PRC-USSR border However the Chinese and Soviet authorities were not always in agreement where the border line run on the ground which led in particular to a border conflict east of lake Zhalanashkol in August 1969
After Kazakhstan became an independent country it negotiated a border treaty with China which was signed in Almaty on April 26 1994 and ratified by the Kazakh president on June 15 1995 According to the treaty a narrow strip of hills east of Zhalanashkol which the USSR and China had contested in 1969 have become recognized as part of China
To delineate certain small sections of the border more precisely additional agreements were signed on 24 September 1997 and 4 July 1998 Over the next several years the border was demarcated on the ground by joint commissions According to the commissions protocols and maps the two countries border line is 1782.75?km long including 1215.86?km of land border and 566.89?km of border line run along or across rivers or lakes The commissions work was documented by several joint protocols finalized with the Protocol signed in Beijing on May 10 2002
The two countries border protection authorities carry out regular meetings and on occasions even joint border patrols
Border crossings
There are a number of highway crossings on the border as well as two railway crossings at Dostyk/Alashankou and at Khorgos


2014 end-of-year rugby union internationals

The 2014 end-of-year rugby tests also known as the 2014 autumn internationals in the Northern Hemisphere were a series of international rugby union matches predominantly played between the visiting Southern Hemisphere countries Argentina Australia Fiji New Zealand Samoa South Africa Tonga ? and the European sides England France Ireland Italy Scotland and Wales
Brazil Canada Germany Georgia Hong Kong Japan Namibia Paraguay Portugal Romania Russia the United States and Uruguay all played at least one test match during the three-week international window
Within the window the three Pacific Island teams faced Tier 1 opposition when Wales and France hosted Fiji and England and Italy hosted Samoa At the time Italy entered the Samoa test on the back of nine consecutive losses and a 15?0 loss to Samoa in Apia in June 2014 Scotland became the first Tier 1 nation to play a Test match on a fully artificial pitch when they hosted Tonga in Kilmarnock winning 37?12
For Georgia a rare opportunity arose to play a Tier 1 nation in the likes of Ireland who played The Lelos for the first time since their Pool D fixture in the 2007 Rugby World Cup Ireland therefore became the first Tier 1 nation to play Georgia since Argentina in June 2013 and the first Six Nations team to host a European Nations Cup team since Scotland's 48?6 win over Romania during the 2006 Autumn Internationals
In addition to that rare fixture the United States played host to the All Blacks for the first time on home soil since 1980 though this was not an official test match Therefore this was the first official test match to take place in America since 1913 with the All Blacks running out 51?3 victors and the last meeting between the two nations took place during the 1991 Rugby World Cup The All Blacks won the game 74-6 in front of a sell-out crowd at Soldier Field
History was made in Hong Kong and Windhoek when a first-ever meeting between Hong Kong and Russia took place acting as a two?test series and a first-ever meeting between Germany and Namibia on Namibian soil
Visits to Scotland Italy and France by Argentina as they tried to build upon their first Rugby Championship win while the losers of that match Australia traveled to Wales Ireland England and France who they had beaten 3-0 during the 2014 June Test series New Zealand played Scotland Wales and England who also lost 3?0 to the All Blacks during the 2014 June Test series while South Africa was one match of the Grand Slam tour as they competed against Ireland England Wales and Italy
Following a reduced 2014 IRB Pacific Nations Cup the IRB organized intercontinental matches between the Pacific Islanders and North America at a natural venue in Europe Tonga and Fiji played the United States while Samoa played Canada In addition to those Romania hosted both Canada and the United States while both Romania and Georgia hosted Japan Georgia also hosted Tonga for just their third meeting and the first since 1999
Following the qualification of Namibia for Rugby World Cup 2015 an IRB?funded tour allowed Namibia to test themselves against higher ranked opposition when they played Canada in Colwyn Bay and Portugal in Lisbon In preparation for a big year in Brazilian sport ahead of the introduction of Rugby sevens into the Olympic Games Brazil hosted Uruguay and Paraguay to broaden their depth in the sport before their automatic participation in the 2016 competition
Several invitational teams were also be in action during the window when the Barbarians contested the Killik Cup with Australia before they played the Leicester Tigers as part of the Tigers 125th anniversary season The M?ori All Blacks played a two?match series against Japan before visiting Singapore to run workshop's with children and clubs in the country They would have played the Asia Pacific Dragons an invitational side made up from top Asian and Polynesian players but the match was cancelled on 21 October due to concerns over the safety of the playing surface at the venue English invitational side The RFU Championship XV will be reformed following their last match in 2012 as they play Canada in Worcester and like recent seasons the French Barbarians will be in action in a first ever meeting against Namibia on their IRB?funded tour
Like in recent seasons New Zealand and Australia played the third and final Bledisloe Cup Test match for the year with New Zealand winning 29?28 with a last-minute try
The 2014 November Tests were for some countries the last chance to experience autumn European conditions and high-intensity intercontinental matches before the 2015 Rugby World Cup especially since five of the matches that took place will appear during the World Cup

Guardian of Piri

Guardian of Piri is the eighth episode of the first series of The screenplay was written by Christopher Penfold
Story
Teaser
The moon is in range of a planet but Computer has not offered any prediction as to whether it would support life Kano informs Koenig that it has been scanning the planet continuously since they became aware the planet existed but still has insufficient data to make a prediction
Koenig does not understand how Computer can remotely control a reconnaissance flight to the surface yet at the same time not determine whether that surface could sustain life Kano replies that the Computer would not be so irrational as to guess
Meanwhile the reconnaissance Eagle piloted by Peter Irving and Ed Davis is moving into a low orbit for final descent two hours ahead of schedule They are making good time - either that or Computer made a mistake
Carter thinks the Eagle is too low and is descending too rapidly but Kano counters that they are doing just fine by Computer Irving reports that they are on course and holding and that everything is fine but Carter observes that they are too close and too fast
Irving playfully flies the Eagle in circles above the surface and jokes with Carter that he must be jealous As he continues to fly in circles and laughs all transmissions from the Eagle suddenly cease and they disappear from scanners
Act One
During a staff meeting Carter is frustrated over the loss of the pilots and demands to know why Computer fouled up on normal flying data - time distance orbital velocity rate of descent Kano insists that Computer does not make mistakes it cannot assess the planet unless it is fed the right information
What bothers Commander Koenig is why Irving and Davis had no sense of danger Carter insists it is because they believed what Computer told them which is why Koenig wants Carter to return to the planet and fly on manual all the way and not to rely on Computer at all
After Carter leaves Bergman explains to the remaining staff that the curve of their course is tightening - they are closer than they expected That could be either good or bad - if the planet can sustain them then they have more time to explore and make up their mind about settling there however if it's affecting them badly then the closer they get the worse it will be
Suddenly Koenig notices that Bergman is not feeling well Bergman says he'll be alright and then promptly collapses Dr Russell examines him - she finds him Ågunconscious rapid heartbeat,Åh yet according to his monitor he is fine
After Dr Russell has examined Professor Bergman in Med Lab she discovers that the amounts of oxygen in their atmosphere has been slowly decreasing Bergman's mechanical heart did not make a natural adjustment the way an organic heart would hence his collapse Koenig concludes that they can't even rely on Computer for normal internal services He orders Sandra Benes to put Alpha atmosphere control on manual and to keep her eye glued to it
Bergman has recovered consciousness and is in good spirits Bergman reports no after effects from his ordeal just a few Ågstrange fantasiesÅh - he has a powerful instinct that the planet is going to be just the right place for the Alphans Koenig responds that it will take a lot more than fantasy to convince him of that
Suddenly Dr Matthias observes that Sara Graham the patient in the next bed is dead He notes that the transfusion blood supply stopped
At first Dr Russell sharply rebukes him for allowing this to happen Dr Matthias snaps back that he cannot control everything - ÅgI am not a computer!Åh
Meanwhile Alan Carter and his co-pilot are descending to the surface of the planet Checking his instruments Carter observes that Computer was wrong about the g-force Carter has cut his approach speed back and reckons they are holding on nicely Paul Morrow and Sandra Benes are monitoring from Mission Control Benes observes that according to readings Carter is right over the crash site As Carter pilots his Eagle into line of site range of Davis and Irving's Eagle he sees a strange site The Eagle is suspended in mid-air ÅgThey haven't crashed!Åh he reports Carter begins to dock with the suspended Eagle
Having completed the docking manoeuvre Carter boards the ill-fated Eagle Upon making his way through he arrives at the Control Module to fit it unoccupied with no sign of its pilots He makes a walking inspection through the rest of the craft and reports to Paul Morrow - ÅgIt's a Mary Celeste There's no one here.Åh
Back on Alpha Koenig orders Carter to return to Moonbase and in an agitated tone tells Kano he wants to talk to him
Kano follows Koenig into his office Koenig asks for a straight and simple report - ÅgWhat is going on?Åh
Kano replies that he has found no fault in the system
Koenig tells Kano that Sara Graham died while hooked up to a computerized monitor following what should have been a simple blood transfusion Professor Bergman's collapse was due to lack of oxygen because Computer went haywire It's fouling everything from commlock systems to important data and Alpha is in desperate trouble They need to find out what is going on down on the planet and obviously Computer is not functioning properly
Kano repeats that they can find no fault Koenig concludes that maybe they are looking for the wrong things in the wrong way Koenig knows one way to find out and asks if Kano is willing to go through with it Kano is shaken but reluctantly agrees
Some time later Kano is prepped in Med Lab for a procedure Koenig explains that he asked David Kano to go through with it because of what is happening on Alpha Dr Russell fills in the medical staff on the background Dr Russell explains that Kano was one of the few people to take part in an experimental program on Earth He underwent an operation to implant a complex of fibre sensors in the cortex of his brain The intention was to link the enormous memory and calculating ability of the computer with the unique thinking ability of the human brain Koenig hopes that by getting inside the computer Kano will determine exactly how it is being affected by the planet Drs Russell and Matthias begin the procedure After a moment of severe discomfort Kano relaxes and smiles Then with a flash of light he disappears startling Dr Russell
Act Two
In Main Mission Professor Bergman elatedly confirms that the moon is in orbit Koenig remarks that while they're in orbit they are trapped Bergman is surprisingly optimistic despite that Alpha has so far lost three men and have no idea what happened to them With no rational explanation Dr Russell fears that whatever happened to the three lost men could happen to any one of them Bergman checks another reading from the Computer and confirms that the planet will support life Koenig prompts him for details which Bergman claims will follow Koenig does not want to rely on Computer - it seems to be telling them just what they want to hear Carter and Bergman conclude that there must be some kind of power there that is not necessarily malevolent Koenig responds that when they do leave Alpha for the last time it will be their decision rather than being presented with an accomplished fact Koenig decides to take Carter with him down to the planet
After their Eagle touches down Koenig instructs Carter that under no circumstances is he to leave the ship Koenig steps out to investigate while Carter remains aboard the Eagle
Koenig scans the white spheres that are all around and contacts Mission Control on Alpha He reports that he gets no readings at all - whatever the spheres are or were they're dead now Koenig says that he will take a walk around and call back if he finds anything unusual
While walking around Koenig spots the suspended Eagle then notices pilots Peter Irving and Ed Davis Each man is still unresponsive when Koenig calls them in a trance Kano is there as well still frozen unresponsive Koenig slaps Kano several times to get his attention Kano does not respond to the physical slap but monotonically states ÅgComputer is right Piri is just perfect for all our needs.Åh Koenig tells him there is nothing there - there is no life
A light then manifests and out of it a female figure emerges and approaches Koenig He discreetly pulls out his stun gun and she speaks to him telling him that she is sent to calm his fears and bring him peace She explains that she has come like this in human form so that he might understand her presence He asks who sent her She replies that she is the servant of the Guardian They found the Earth's moon floating helplessly throughout their universe They have brought the Alphans to Piri to relieve the humans of their pain Koenig asks if they are inviting the Alphans to stay and settle here The female tells him that is the will of the Guardian She offers to show him the peace of Piri
As they walk she explains that millennia ago this planet was peopled by Pirians and great technical skill They built a world of machines to run the necessities of life so that the people could enjoy their pleasure Then they created the Guardian to control the machines and save them from decisions Their life was perfect and the Guardian was directed to maintain it Koenig replies that this is not possible for human beings which are born live and die Life is transient and cannot be maintained The woman notes that humans are imperfect and take time for granted Absolute perfection lasts forever and so the Guardian has suspended time Koenig determines that this planet is not suitable for human life
Koenig asks about his men and how the Guardian got them here She tells him that ÅgWe reached out and offered them happiness and they accepted.Åh Time is stopping for them Koenig does not like this He believes that life is stopping for them They argue and Koenig sticks to his position that this place is not for humans She tells him that they have already accepted the dominion of the Guardian - there is nothing that Koenig can do He turns away and tries to convince Kano to go with him
Kano does not respond He tries with Pete who also does not respond The servant of the Guardian tells Koenig that the Guardian is making him perfect as that is its prime directive The servant vanishes into the light while Koenig runs towards the Eagle and calls to Carter to prepare for liftoff Carter does not respond he is relaxing aboard the Eagle and ignoring Koenig's call
Koenig arrives at the Eagle and they lift off from the surface Carter comments that this is a nice place kind of peaceful and Koenig replies that this is no place for the Alphans Carter gives Koenig a strange look and to Koenig's alarm begins flying the Eagle erratically Koenig wrestles Carter away from the controls The two men fight in the cabin while the Eagle unpiloted flies in circles above the planet's surface Koenig finally overpowers Carter and takes over control of the Eagle With one arm injured in the fight Koenig uses his other arm to stabilize the Eagle and return to Moonbase Alpha He attempts to contact Alpha en route but his signal is ignored His voice echoes through Main Mission which is deserted He requests directions for final approach and for Dr Russell to have a medical team stand by There is no response
Meanwhile Paul Morrow and various staff are singing and cavorting oblivious to Koenig's call Koenig lands the Eagle He stumbles through the corridors of Moonbase Alpha hearing the sounds of the crowd cheering and celebrating in the distance Exhausted and in pain he makes his way to the crowd just as Professor Bergman jubilantly proposes a toast to the new world Russell and Bergman notice Koenig walk into the room and toast him - Ågto our very own Christopher Columbus!Åh Koenig collapses while the crowd sings ÅgFor he's a jolly good fellow.Åh
Act Three
Koenig regains consciousness He is on a bed in Med Lab Dr Matthias notices that Koenig is awake and tells him to relax Koenig asks where is Dr Russell and Dr Matthias tells him she is attending a command conference Koenig walks out of Med Lab and makes his way to Main Mission He walks in on the command conference in the midst of a discussion about whether to bring an operating theatre down to the planet Professor Bergman points out that with the moon in a fixed orbit around Piri they can return whenever they'd like - so when someone needs an operation they would bring them back to Alpha to perform the operation and return The command staff notice Koenig's presence - he has arrived just as they are planning the last phase of Operation Exodus They are making their plans on the basis of phoney reports - Piri has attacked their computer and their minds He does not succeed in convincing them of what he really saw on the planet Koenig runs out of the conference room while the command staff resume planning their exodus
Koenig attempts to disable the Auxiliary systems and is informed that his orders conflict with the directives of the Guardian Frustrated he begins pulling circuits out of the computer bank Paul Morrow runs in and tries to stop him Koenig knocks him out and continues pulling out circuits Then Professor Bergman confronts him Koenig insists that he is not mad - he is the only sane one left He tries to convince the crew that they are in danger from the Guardian Dr Russell approaches him and discreetly injects him with a sedative and Koenig again collapses
After some time has passed he awakes in his quarters He gets up to leave and is informed by the computer that his commlock device is disabled and that he is confined to his quarters Koenig asks by whose order and is told by Operation Exodus committee Koenig demands to know which individual and is told it was Dr Russell on the grounds that his freedom diminishes the safety of Alpha
Meanwhile in the conference room Dr Russell approaches Professor Bergman and reports that Koenig is conscious again - and that Computer says he is as picky as ever Dr Russell suggests that they don't take Koenig but Bergman believes that Koenig will come around and change his mind They decide to leave Koenig an Eagle so that when he comes to his senses he would join them in his own good time
Koenig paces in his quarters when the base goes dark With the power out he realizes he is no longer locked in his quarters Koenig goes out and walks through the abandoned corridors He makes his way to the abandoned Main Mission just in time to see the fleet of Eagles taking off from Alpha He watches the Eagles fly towards Piri leaving him alone and abandoned on Alpha
Act Four
Koenig walks through the abandoned Main Mission and addresses Computer ÅgI have to talk to someone.Åh The machine responds that only auxiliary services are available Computer has removed to planet Piri Alone and dejected Koenig contemplates his pills Suddenly the female servant of the Guardian appears and chastises him ÅgI took you for a stronger man Just how long do you think you can last?Åh Three days of despair have reduced him to pills to help him sleep the hours away In his crude human way he tries to numb his mind against the Guardian ÅgAnd yet the Guardian can make the process much easier for you.Åh She gestures toward the view screen which displays the Alphans on the surface below ÅgIf only you would choose the Pirian way.Åh She acknowledges that Koenig fought hard in the struggle for survival and that his burden of responsibility has been almost unbearable - and yet he has borne it She heals the wound on his forehead and his broken arm and tells him that he can now relax and enjoy the peace which he has earned for his people His wounds are healed and Dr Russell has not had to life a finger For Dr Russell her nerves are relaxed and her appetites are assuaged Her struggle is over and Koenig may join her in paradise Angered Koenig punches a display monitor and again injures his hand The servant approaches him to heal it again He refuses to allow her and tells her to leave him with his pain It reminds him he is human
The servant explains that the arrival of the Alphans has disturbed the peace of Piri and that they must be made fit to live there That is the Guardian's directive
Koenig asks if that is why the Guardian has sabotaged their computer The servant explains that the computer was not sabotaged merely taken over for the Guardian's use Of all things on Alpha its mind was most nearly perfect and it most readily accepted the will of the Guardian Koenig argues that it may be alright for the computer because it's a machine but the Alphans are human beings - they can't exist on Pirian terms The servant responds that perfection is absolute the Alphans must be made perfect Koenig walks away and makes his way to the remaining Eagle He pilots it back to Piri
On the surface the Alphans stand or recline in a dazed state without a care Dr Russell and Professor Bergman observe the arrival of Koenig's Eagle ÅgThere's John.Åh Helena Russell considers whether she should go to him and decides that he will find his way
Koenig has landed and finds Sandra Benes he asks her where are the Pirians She barely registers his presence and responds with gibberish Koenig finds Paul Morrow who also does not help ÅgWe're all so happy!Åh he says
Koenig finds Helena Russell She thinks he has come to join them at last Koenig asks her where are the Pirians ÅgThey have given us eternal life,Åh is her only reply Koenig takes her by the arm and guides her back to the Eagle as she giggles Once aboard he sits her down and connects her to a medical machine He uses the machine to shock her system After several attempts he dials the intensity high enough to finally break her out of her trance She asks did her heart stop ÅgWorse Much worse,Åh he tells her He is glad to have her back He asks her to tell him exactly what happened She recalls the exodus They went down to the planet and there was just a light Koenig recognizes that the light is the Guardian he wants to know about the people who control it Russell tells him that she did not see any people Koenig asks her to think hard Were there any machines Russell tells thin there was nothing there Nothing moves and no sign of life Koenig realizes that there is in fact no life no Pirians
The servant of the Guardian is aware of what Koenig has done and calls on the other Alphans She tells them that there is one amongst them who threatens their happiness who comes to destroy their peace This one will not accept the dominion of the Guardian and he must be destroyed She tells him it is their commander John Koenig and that they must destroy him so that the Guardian may live and protect them forever The Alphans chant ÅgLong live the Guardian!Åh
The Alphans spot Koenig walking with Russell towards the portal of light Carter stalks him with his stun gun drawn After a few shots are exchanged Koenig stuns Carter He runs towards the portal - the Guardian The Alphans tell him there is no place for him - that he is destroying their peace and they're going to kill him now Russell has picked up Carter's stun gun and defends Koenig
Koenig aims his stun gun at the servant and demands where are her own people He points out that they don't exist because they died just like his own people are dying right now He fires at the servant and she falls back Koenig approaches her and when he uncovers her face he sees that she is a machine He lifts up hr form to show the Alphans ÅgThis is what passes for life on Piri!Åh he tells them
Suddenly the Guardian explodes The Alphans snap out of their trance and Bergman points out ÅgThe moon is going out of orbit!Åh Koenig orders everyone back to their ships As the planet deteriorates the Alphans scatter ad run back to their Eagles They lift off their Eagles and return to Alpha their home
Back on the moonbase the Alphans reflect on what they have just experienced Dr Russell observes that when Koenig destroyed the servant he destroyed the Guardian With no Guardian to suspend time time was restored and the moon resumed its original course past the planet Kano reports that Computer has analyzed the data from the long range sensors Planet Piri now has life water vegetation everything Koenig muses that they brought a dead planet back to life He wonders if they should have stayed

Restoring Family Links

Restoring Family Links or RFL is a program of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement more specifically the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC and National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies involving activities that aim to prevent separation and disappearance look for missing persons restore and maintain contact between family members and clarify the fate of persons reported missing The activities are carried out by the components of the RFL is sometimes also referred to as tracing
The ICRC and National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies form together a global network the Family Links Network This network works across international borders present with staff and volunteers at grass-roots level worldwide to locate people and put them back into contact with their relatives observing of the principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement
The most common situations where the Family Links Network takes action are when loss of contact is due to armed conflict or other situations of violence natural or man-made disaster migration and in other situations of humanitarian need such as allowing detainees to keep in touch with their families while in prison
RFL services are free of charge
History
The ICRCÅfs work to restore family links goes back to 1870 and the Franco-Prussian War The institution obtained lists of French prisoners held by German forces which were used to inform families about the fate and whereabouts of the soldiers
Even before at the very origin of the Red Cross the MovementÅfs founder Henry Dunant wrote of taking a message from dying soldier Claudius Mazuet to his parents in ÅgA Memory of SolferinoÅh
A similar effort was undertaken in the Balkans in 1912 Here the ICRC set up an agency to help families send packages to family members held prisoners
During the First World War in accordance with the mandate it had received from the 4th International Conference of the Red Cross in 1887 the ICRC set up the International Agency of Prisoners of War By the end of the war it had handled over 7 million records
During the Second World War the ICRC created the Central Prisoners of War Agency now the Central Tracing Agency in Geneva The Agency gathered and recorded data received from governments about prisoners of war The information was used to respond to enquiries from families who were looking for news about their loved ones By the end of 1946 the Agency had received and forwarded more than twenty million letters and cards addressed to prisoners of war and interned civilians
Since then tracing people separated by conflict disaster and migration has become a core element of the Red Cross and Red Crescent work In 2012 the ICRC together with the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies handled more than 279,000 family messages facilitated 227,500 phone calls registered over 3,500 separated children and reunited more than 2,300 children with their families
About
Depending on the context Restoring Family Links services include the following
Services are offered under thorough guidelines described in manuals for caseworkers and other volunteers and staff Availability depends on global and local conditions and may change in keeping with current events
The Family Links website familylinks.icrc.org managed by the ICRC in cooperation with National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies describes the locally available Restoring Family Links services in more than 150 countries and provides contact details of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in each country
Looking for family members
Looking for missing persons usually involves several steps starting with a person putting forward a request Tracing Request to a National Society or the ICRC The Tracing Request gathers information which might be helpful to find the sought person and is often obtained via a personal interview with the enquirer
The information in the request is compared to various data depending on the situation such as lists of persons detained lists of persons registered as receiving or having received treatment in hospital information received where there is a telephone hotline lists of dead or people who are safe and well
The ICRC or the National Society will use all possible means to search for the person including going to the last known address contacting neighbours of the sought person visiting displaced people and refugee camps consulting institutions the authorities or other organizations broadcasting names of sought persons through the media etc
When a large-scale emergency occurs online tracing is also possible Online tracing services have been used since 1996 in connection with various conflicts and disasters to publish lists of names and information on
Individuals can access these lists directly on the webpage to look for the names of their family members They can also publish their details on the webpage such as their name and location when they are safe and well or the name of a sought relative with a request for news
Restoring contact
Restoring contact between family members when their location is known is done via various means such as short letters called Red Cross Messages RCMs normal telephones or satellite phones
Technological developments have led to a decreased in the use of RCMs in favour of telephones The total number of calls made for RFL purposes increased from 3,958 to 210,096 between 2008 and 2012
However in some contexts such as for instance the Democratic Republic of Congo phone and postal services can be limited and the Red Cross message are sometimes brought personally by Red Cross volunteers often on bicycles over very long distances to remote villages across the country
Reuniting families
The national authorities have the primary responsibility for reuniting separated families following conflict disaster migration or other situations of humanitarian need National Societies and the ICRC may assist in family reunification if this is possible and if security conditions allow
For refugees it is generally the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR the International Organization for Migration IOM and/or the relevant embassies that help with family reunification They work together with National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the ICRC if necessary
In the case of the family reunification for unaccompanied and separated children the Family Links network collaborates with UNICEF
Missing persons and their families
In cases where family contact cannot be restored the ICRC continues its efforts to clarify the fate and whereabouts of the missing person but is also supporting the families of missing persons with other needs
The ICRCÅfs work on the missing historically consisted of a few core activities primarily dissemination of the rules of international humanitarian law IHL which require that states work to prevent disappearances and bilateral interventions requesting parties to the conflict to search for and provide information after separation in accordance with IHL
In recent years the organization has developed a more holistic and multidisciplinary approach for the families of missing persons aiming long-term support mechanisms for families of the missing The main goal of this approach is to help people rebuild their social lives and find emotional well-being
Related services
In some circumstances the ICRC or National Societies may also help with other services The ICRC for example can issue a travel document An ICRC Travel Document is issued to meet the specific humanitarian needs of asylum seekers refugees vulnerable migrants displaced or stateless persons who due to the lack of appropriate identity papers cannot return to their country of origin or of habitual residence or go to a country willing to receive them either permanently or for temporary asylum The ICRC Travel Document was created in 1945 to help tens of thousands of concentration camp survivors former prisoners of war deportees forced labourers and other stranded civilians who had no valid travel documents It is valid only for a one-way travel and dependent on the receiving country issuing a visa if required
Other documents issued by the ICRC include among others attestations of arrestation or detention or information to the public via the ICRC archives
The public can request information from the ICRC archives related to World War II cases
Legal provisions related to Restoring Family Links
In situations of armed conflicts receiving news about the fate of family members family reunification and clarifying the fate of the missing is a right under international law The four Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols state for example that governments should take all possible steps to facilitate the reunification of separated families
The ICRC has a special role to play with regards to International Humanitarian Law such as
Role of the National Societies and the ICRC in Restoring family links
The RFL activities of the various components of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement in particular the ICRC and the National Societies are drawn from the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols the MovementÅfs Statutes and the resolutions of the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent and those of the Council of Delegates
National Societies
National Societies act as auxiliaries to the authorities in their respective country and embody the principles of the Movement
Each National Society responds to humanitarian needs in their local context by a range of activities Regarding RFL this implies the search for family members restoring contact between family members and if possible helping to reunite families These activities may extend well beyond the end of a conflict or a natural disaster
National Societies cooperate with each other with the ICRC and with the International Federation on activities related to RFL
The ICRC in RFL
Through its delegations the ICRC carries out direct action to help separated families whenever required and possible An extensive long-term field presence and close cooperation with National Societies place the ICRC in close proximity to beneficiaries
The ICRC is responsible for ensuring the operation of the Central Tracing Agency CTA as provided for in the Geneva Conventions The CTA acts as coordinator and technical adviser to National Societies ICRC delegations and governments on RFL It helps strengthen the capacity of National Societies in RFL and coordinates these activities with the organisational development and disaster preparedness support provided by the International Federation

Edwards Lifesciences

Edwards LifesciencesÅf roots date to 1958 when Miles ÅgLowellÅh Edwards set out to build the first artificial heart
Edwards was a 60-year-old recently retired engineer holding 63 patents in an array of industries with an entrepreneurial spirit and a dream of helping patients with heart disease His fascination with healing the heart was sparked in his teens when he suffered two bouts of a disease called rheumatic fever which can scar heart valves and eventually cause the heart to fail
With a background in hydraulics and fuel pump operations Edwards believed the human heart could be mechanized He presented the idea to Dr Albert Starr a young surgeon at the University of Oregon Medical School who thought the idea was too complex Instead Starr encouraged Edwards to focus first on developing an artificial heart valve for which there was an immediate need
After just two years the first Starr-Edwards mitral valve was designed developed tested and successfully placed in a patient Newspapers around the world reported on what they termed a ÅgmiraculousÅh heart surgery
This innovation spawned a company Edwards Laboratories which set up shop in Santa Ana California ? not far from where Edwards LifesciencesÅf corporate headquarters is located today
In 1966 Edwards Laboratories was purchased by American Hospital Supply Corporation and became American Edwards Laboratories Then in 1985 American Edwards was acquired by Baxter International Inc In early 2000 the company was spun off as an independent publicly held corporation and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ÅgEW.Åh
Today Edwards continues as a leader in the field of tissue replacement heart valves and repair products and advanced hemodynamic monitoring which have helped treat and manage more than 2 million patients worldwide Each year more than 300,000 valve replacements are performed worldwide through open-heart surgery utilizing either bioprosthetic tissue valves or mechanical valves Edwards products include tissue replacement heart valves sold under such brand names as Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT and Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT MAGNA and also valve repair products that are used by surgeons to fix instead of replace a patientÅfs valve
The Edwards SAPIEN family of heart valves are delivered via a procedure called transcatheter aortic valve replacement TAVR This procedure enables the placement of a collapsible heart valve into the body via a tube-based delivery system catheter that can be inserted through multiple access routes including either an incision in the leg transfemoral or in between the ribs and to be threaded up to the heart transapical or through the front of the chest and then through a small hole in the aorta transaortic The valve is designed to replace a patientÅfs diseased native aortic valve without traditional open-heart surgery and while the heart continues to beat ? avoiding the need to stop the patientÅfs heart and connect them to a heart-lung machine that temporarily takes over the function of the heart and the patientÅfs breathing during surgery cardiopulmonary bypass
Edwards also manufactures products for vascular therapy along with hemodynamic monitoring devices for measuring cardiovascular performance during surgery and in the ICU Hemodynamic monitoring is the measurement of blood circulation and cardiac function that allows clinicians to evaluate whether enough oxygen is being delivered to the organs and tissues Healthcare providers use this information to detect changes or problems in a patientÅfs health which allows for more informed immediate treatment decisions
To facilitate on-pump cardiac surgery procedures through smaller incisions Edwards also offers a cardiac surgery product line comprising soft tissue retractors venous and arterial cannulae aortic occlusion venting and coronary sinus catheters as well as reusable instruments for performing minimally invasive valvular procedures
Edwards operates the websites Edwards.com NewHeartValve.com and YourHeartValve.com


Victim theory

Victim theory is a term that derives from contemporary history It is commonly used to describe a manner of argumentation widely spread throughout Austria after World War II concerning the time period before the Anschluss interdiction of the NSDAP attempted coup of the NS in 1934 violences and riots of the NS in Austria Thousand-Mark-Blockade etc respectively the role of Austria in the time of National Socialism According to these manners of argumentation the state of Austria was the first victim to fall prey to the aggressive foreign policy of the National Socialists A synonym for victim theory is victim myth corresponding to the terms of Habsburg Myth Myth of the emperor Myth of origins
Since the victim theory effectuated a suppressing of the fact of Austrian collaboration concerning the atrocities of the National Socialists it is often declared to be the Lie of Life of the Second Republic
Origin
The involuntary demise of Austria as an international legal personality was called upon as a legitimization for accepting the victimization of the country of Austria - standing in accord with the imprisonment of members of the Austrian government immediately after the invasion of German troops Supporting this theory was a passage of the Moscow Declaration of November 1 1943 in which the minister of foreign affairs of the United Kingdom the United States of America and the Soviet Union claim that Austria the first free country that should fall prey to the typical aggressive policy of Hitler and that it should be liberated from German rule and that the Annexation of 1938 should count as invalid and futile As a consequence the state of Austria was under constitutional law regarded as a victim of NS-policy
The former went alongside a victimization of individuals after the end of World War II In these cases however a differentiation between a political victim and a war victim was being made
Effects and long-term consequences
Soon the victim theory was being used in phrasings of the Declaration of Independence of April 27th 1945 in which it served Austria to part with the German Reich The document counts as a founding document of the Second Republic It states amongst others that the Annexation in the year of 1938 was initiated through external military threats and through the highly treacherous terror of a Nazi-Fascist minority and that it was forced upon the Austrian population that had become helpless through a military and belligerent occupation
The victim theory showed effects already in the postwar period Denazification was carried out in the first postwar years - even stricter than in Germany - Verbotsgesetz 1947 It was however practically ended in the course of the Cold War and therefore - from a retrospective point of view - did not take place to a satisfactory extent Furthermore the restitution of robbed property was being increasingly delayed
Accordingly the suppression of complicity of many Austrians with the atrocities committed during the NS-times was responsible for the slow progress on the reconciliation with the political victims of National Socialist persecution Jews Roma and others The war victims on the other hand were treated differently The fact that the National Socialist Reichs-government of Adolf Hitler had led the people of Austria that had been made powerless and weak-willed in a senseless and hopeless war of conquest which no Austrian had ever wanted made it easy to entitle members of the Wehrmacht as war victims Declared as war victims were also members of the Waffen-SS that had joined after October 1st 1943 since membership was regarded obligatory starting from this date In this case the division of the Third Camp Drittes Lager in domestic policy between the two parties SPO and OVP was concerned to a large extent
The victim theory was furthermore used by Austrian government members which being KZ-inmates emigrants etc were all really persecuted ones in negotiations over the Austrian State Treaty so as to get rid of the idea of national complicity and to ward off the extensive claims of the USSR
Through a consequent retention of the victim theory over several decades the time of National Socialism was barely processed in Austria up to the early 1990s and the role of many Austrians as an offender barely perceived Only since 1986 in the course of the Waldheim Scandal and the Remembrance Year of 1988 did a sophisticated engagement with the NS-past take place In this context Franz Vranitzky chancellor in the year of 1991 was the first official representative of Austria who confessed the crimes committed by Austrians and asked for forgiveness Accordingly the Wehrmachtsausstellung was discussed in a controversial manner for it openly exhibited contents that had up to then stood under a strict taboo This act of rethinking also facilitated the realization of the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service which had already been promoted by the political scientist Andreas Maislinger in the late 70s through the Interior Minister who is in charge of the Alternative civilian service Franz Loschnak
Only very late that is in the year of 1998 and under massive international pressure - and especially due to complaints of the USA - did Austria appoint a committee of historians of the Republic of Austria that should research and report on the deprivation of fortune from 1938 to 1945 as well as the restitutions and compensations after 1945 Many restitutions followed as a result of this research and these efforts
In summary the course of events under constitutional law of 1938 as to the Republic of Austria has to be regarded as a janus-faced act and this only in conjunction with various and diverse interests during the Cold War Whereas observed from one perspective the state Republic of Austria fell prey to NS-politics from another perspective citizens of the Republic of Austria were compliant actors when it came to the enforcement of NS-policies
Finally some journalists regarded the reactions to the so-called EU sanctions against Austria as the last manifestation of the victim theory so far and this time with inverse prefixes When the at that time 14 other member countries of the EU opposed to a participation of the right-winged populistic FPO in the government that was being reassembled and when - after a nevertheless ensued coalition of OVP and FPO - diplomatic sanctions against this government were put into action these steps were interpreted by political forces and the country's media as paternalistic measures against Austria and with that against the whole country


Daisy Marchisotti

Daisy Elizabeth Marchisotti nee Iriving 28 September 1904 ? 1987 was an Australian social and political activist whose commitment to Indigenous rights saw her remain an active member of the political community up until her death in 1987 She is known for her communist affiliations and was an active member of the Communist Party of Australia
Biography
Marchisotti graduated from Macedon Elementary School in her hometown of Melbourne in 1918 Marchisotti demonstrated a wide range of interests from a very young age authoring personal diaries and learning music Marchisotti had achieved a grade four in theory of music in 1925 at the age of 21 years old In 1934 by the time she was 30 years old she graduated from the University of Melbourne although details about her final qualification are unclear
Marchisotti was passionate about public affairs She worked voluntarily for the Civil Defence Organization of Melbourne during the period of national emergency during World War II In addition she qualified in First Aid and Injuries and Air Raid Precautions which were certified by the St John Ambulance Association and the Victorian State Emergency Council respectively
Marchisotti developed an interest in left-wing politics in the 1940s and became an active member among many social movements She had previously worked as a stenographer and typist from 1926 up until 1948 During this time she advanced her interest in social equality eventually becoming a member of the Communist Party of Australia CPA in 1951 resigning from a better-paying office job After moving to Brisbane Marchisotti met Luigi Marchisotti the couple married on 10 November 1949
The case for Equal Pay in Australia was one of Marchisotti's most notable achievements as a social activist Despite proving ultimately unsuccessful Marchisotti had prepared a thorough case and media at the time were taken aback at her ability to present convincing evidence and arguments
In 1964 Marchisotti became a member of the CPA women's delegation to the Soviet Union
Marchisotti also took an active interest in Indigenous affairs and was involved with the Queensland sub-branch of the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders FCAATSI She edited the Federal Council's newsletter and wrote articles on Indigenous issues for both FCAATSI and the CPA On 7 October 1982 Marchisotti participated in a street march to expose issues of racism in the 1982 Commonwealth Games More than 200 people were arrested including Marchisotti
Communist Party of Australia
The CPA was founded in Sydney in October 1920 by a group of socialists inspired by the reports of revolution coming out of the USSR at the time The CPA aimed to introduce many of the same ideologies to Australian politics While the party remained relatively minor in terms of challenging Australia's political landscape it did register significant influence in the formation of trade unions
In 1922 the CPA became affiliated with the Communist International an organisation that rejected colonialism and imperialism instead championing the rights of minorities For the CPA transferring this ideology to an Australian context meant the struggles of the Australian Indigenous community became a specific area of interest The struggles of the Indigenous community was a cause to which Marchisotti dedicated most of her working life It is unsurprising then that Marchisotti had been a long time sympathiser with the communist movement in Australia before officially joining the CPA in 1941 Her commitment to the party and its approach to politics is one of the few aspects of Marchisotti's professional life that is reasonably well documented however there is little substantive evidence of the specifics of her work for the party It is clear however that most of her work was related to the fight for equality for Indigenous Australians Marchisotti's involvement with the CPA also gave her the opportunity to participate in feminist-driven campaigns that were aimed at improving the lived experiences of women whether that be in the home or work place
ÅgI hate capitalismÅc Look at the tortures throughout the worldÅc Sometimes I lay awake at night worrying about some injustices In the morning I have to act in some way If you have any humanity in you you must do something.Åh
Equal Pay Case
In 1950 the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration set the female rate of pay at 75% of the male rate In the 1950s men usually worked full-time with an unfair social norm which permitted men to discriminate against women in Australian society Women in the workforce were often limited to jobs such as nurses teachers and receptionists Not surprisingly they were usually paid less than men
In 1951 the Queensland Branch of the Clerks Union placed a claim for Equal Pay to the Industrial Court of Queensland This was an unusual case which came about after continual pressure on the executive by membership of the Clerks Union proved futile too busy to prepare a case was the excuse offered to the activists Marchisotti a member of the union undertook the research with the support of Berenice Collins another member and Val Howard a clerk in the Sheet Metal Workers Union Office
Marchisotti had prepared a complete case gathering all the information provided from experienced people plus a great mass of figures and other information obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics In regards to her preparation for the case Marchisotti has been quoted ÅgI was hellishly nervous but my voice is pretty strong and I was always good at reading I read the whole ten pages of the submission bar the tables which I had typed and carefully double-checked Marchisotti finalised her submission by requesting a Åerate for the jobÅf regardless of sex and stating the reasons for this demand Aside from Berenice and Val Joan Riordan an extreme right-winger the only woman branch councillor in the union showed up at the Industrial Court where the case was being heard The court was also filled with journalists members from the Union of Australian Women and the President of the National Council of Women Mrs Byth Mrs Byth even asked for permission to intervene the case as it significantly mattered to women When the case was over reporters and newspapermen were amazed that a woman could put up such a convincing case
Justice Matthews tried to get the witnesses to agree that women were not just ordinary clerical workers but quite above average in intelligence and thus might be underpaid Despite the evidence provided the judges decided this had not proved that all females in the industry were performing the same work as males or producing the same return of profit to their employers This judgement raised significant public concern People considered it an unfair ruling and claimed it was obvious that they were determined to refuse the claim regardless of the presented evidence The judgement concluded that it was most difficult to prove that women produced the same profit as men deciding there was insufficient reason to approve the claim
Unfortunately Marchisotti had difficulty in obtaining employment following the case due to the amount of negative publicity generated by her involvement
Involvement with Indigenous Affairs
In addition to her communist affiliation Marchisotti was also dedicated to Indigenous affairs in Australia especially from a feminist standpoint As a result she became an industrious member of the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders FCAATSI as well as its Queensland sub-branch QCAATSI During her time working for these organisations she edited the council newsletter and wrote articles on Indigenous issues for use by both organisations
Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders FCAATSI
During February 1958 a group of individuals travelled to Adelaide to form a federal body to advocate the removal of racist and discriminatory state legislation across the country Although there was no recognised Aboriginal representative from Queensland at this meeting the state was represented by the Queensland United Council for Aboriginal Welfare this collective would evolve into QCAATSI which Marchisotti would become heavily involved in Marchisotti would also work closely with noted feminist and Indigenous political activist Oodgeroo Noonuccal who worked as the Queensland State Secretary of QCAATSI in the 1960s Initially the establishment of FCAATSI comprised a diverse range of activists ranging from feminists Christians communists and peace activists FCAATSI would progress to play a critical role in Aboriginal affairs in Australia including establishing the 1967 referendum to amend the constitution as well as the petitioning for inclusion of Aboriginal families within the census
Queensland Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders QCAATSI
In 1958 noted feminist and social justice campaigner Ada Bromham unified Queensland social activists from existing Indigenous organisations including Marchisotti to from the QCAATSI Rather than act as a separate entity to FCAATSI however this movement effectively acted as the state branch of the federal organisation Despite some members accusing QCAATSI of too closely adopting communist influence the QCAATSI enjoyed extensive active membership from noted Indigenous rights campaigners for many years Among Marchisotti these included Kathy Cochrane with whom Marchisotti frequently exchanged letters Celia Smith and Rodney Hall As a reflection of this the council enjoyed a cooperative relationship with other existing Indigenous activist groups such as the Cairns Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders Advancement League CATSIAL QCAATSI worked closely with the federal council on matters of national integrity but largely took an inclusive approach in developing individual movements preferring to deliberate with other organisations and individuals in terms of constitutional reform
Nonetheless in 1961 a split developed among those members considered heavily communist in political orientation including Marchisotti who were prepared to challenge Queensland legislation and others who were less prepared to take an active stance This latter group formed the One People of Australia League OPAL consisting primarily of mainstream Christian and traditionalist idealists From this point OPAL was one of the few groups to remain overtly distinct from QCAATSI preferring to negotiate and liaise with the Queensland government rather than perform overt political activism Marchisotti remaining with QCAATSI assisted in organising the fourth annual conference of the Federal Council for Aboriginal Advancement held at the University of Queensland in 1961 She also continued to publish Aboriginal rights articles on behalf of both QCAATSI and the CPA It was at this time that Marchisotti also began drafting her only book to be published by the CPA Land Rights The Black Struggle Marchisotti continued her publication of articles until the very latter stages of life her last confirmed publication was made in the June 1980 edition of the Tribune with Marchisotti aged 75

On Thursday 7 October 1982 Marchisotti joined a protest by Aboriginal people and others outside a Commonwealth Games venue in Brisbane The 1982 games in particular had been noted as experiencing widespread Aboriginal protests throughout their duration in attempt by activists to bring the lack of land rights poor living conditions and the suppression of political voice to an international audience Marchisotti was arrested for her involvement in the protests and for disobeying an explicit police instruction resulting in a fine of fifty dollars Marchisotti's fine notice lists her offence simply as Br S.36 b traffic act Upon her appearance before a magistrate in Brisbane she has been quoted as saying I am seventy-eight years old and a pensioner I did not take part in my action lightly was my belief that the only way to change Queensland's racist laws was to take the action I did
List of Publications
While it is known that Marchisotti was a prolific and dedicated writer especially during her time with the CPA and particularly the FCAATSI where she took on the role of editor for their newsletter there seems to be very little of her published work available in the public domain
Countless drafts and copies of articles submitted to various publications including the Tribune The Courier Mail and The Guardian can be found in Marchisotti's personal archives however this information cannot be verified as most of these articles are only attached to personal letters There is no confirmation of what was published or when if at all However the following three works are have been published are available in the public domain


Battle of Steenbergen 1583

The Battle of Steenbergen also known as the Capture of Steenbergen of 1583 took place on June 17 1583 at Steenbergen Duchy of Brabant Spanish Netherlands present-day North Brabant the Netherlands and was an important victory of the Spanish Army of Flanders led by Don Alexander Farnese Prince of Parma Governor-General of the Spanish Netherlands over the French English and Dutch forces led by the French Marshal Armand de Gontaut Baron de Biron and the English commander Sir John Norreys during the Eighty Years War the Anglo-Spanish War 1585?1604 and in the context of the French Wars of Religion The victory of the Spaniards ended the Treaty of Plessis-les-Tours and Francis Duke of Anjou left the Netherlands in late June
Background
After the failure of the combined army of Dutch French and English soldiers led by Marshal Armand de Gontaut Baron de Biron put in charge in the army by Prince William of Orange to relieve the city of Eindhoven the French commander moved his army to the north of Roosendaal between Breda and Bergen op Zoom and after several days of siege captured the castle of Wouw on 10 May Meanwhile the Prince of Parma with the city of Eindhoven insured continued his advance across North Brabant Farnese moved with part of his army to Namur while the rest of the Spanish troops commanded by General Karl von Mansfeld captured the towns of Turnhout and Hoogstraten defeating the small Dutch garrisons and finally the city of Diest on May 27
From his base at Namur the Prince of Parma advanced to capture the town of Herentals but the siege was finally abandoned and Parma continued to advance to confront the forces of Marshal Biron located near Roosendaal With the news of the Spanish advance Biron moved his army to the outsides of Steenbergen between the same town and Bergen op Zoom and on June 17 with the arrival of the forces of Parma the battle began
Battle and capture of Steenbergen
Despite their numerical superiority the combined forces led by Biron and Sir John Norreys who commanded the English infantry along with the Welsh Captain Roger Williams the just officer who put some order in defending the Spanish attack were literally swept away by the Spanish cavalry and then by the infantry suffering heavy losses thanks also to the bombardment success of the guns of Don Hernando de Acosta Lieutenant-General of the artillery of the Army of Flanders who had a very important role in the battle The forces of Biron and Norreys suffered at least 3,200 casualties and almost all the baggage barrels of gunpowder 36 flags and 3 banners captured On the Spanish side the casualties were 400 dead or wounded The French Marshal himself who tried to repel the attack of the Spaniards he fell from his horse and broke his leg
The combined army that was virtually destroyed retreated in disarray to the fortress of Bergen op Zoom and other towns controlled by the Dutch rebels and the Spanish troops took with little opposition Steenbergen A few days later the lack of pay and the differences between the French soldiers mostly Catholics and the Dutch and English Protestant troops even the differences between the Dutch and English commanders ended with hundreds of desertions among Biron's troops
Consequences
The result of the battle was an overwhelming Spanish victory not only in terms of casualties in favour to the Spaniards also in terms of immediate strategic consequences The position of Francis Duke of Anjou became impossible to hold with the States-General of the Netherlands and he eventually left the Low Countries in late June The defeat and the end of the Treaty of Plessis-les-Tours was a severe blow to the Dutch Protestants and discredited William of Orange his main supporter Moreover the Spanish progress was unstoppable and the Prince of Parma moved to Dunkirk city blocked by the forces of the Spanish commander Don Cristobal de Mondragon On July 16 the bombardment began and a few days later the city surrendered to the Spaniards along with Nieuwpoort on July 23
The Spanish army continued its advance and after the possibility of put under siege the port city of Ostend the plan was abandoned and the bulk of the army advanced to Diksmuide that capitulated on 1 August Meanwhile a Spanish detachment also captured Veurne and Menen

We owe him a debt of gratitude not only the people of New Zealand not only Parliament not only the organisations that he has convinced to support the campaign but those women children and men in other countries who have been saved as a result of the activities that have started and who will avoid being maimed or killed in the future

Mercurana are medium-sized frogs males are smaller measuring 35?mm in length while the female is up to 65?mm They have a slender body which is rusty-brown in colour with small black speckles on the back Females are more greenish-yellow in colour on the back The dorsal surface of the skin is a rough shagreen The ventral front side is gradually lightened and becomes mostly white Some areas of the underside of the fore-and hind-limbs have patches of yellow colour The chest belly and throat are glandular The snout is rounded and protruding Unlike other related species Mercurana has large webbed toes while the fingers are free with large discs and is characterised by the presence of vomerine teeth and lingual papilla They have distinct dark eyes with horizontal and oval-shaped pupil
Biology
Mercurana are arboreal frogs and live in lowland swamp forest They breed during the pre-monsoon During the breeding season males call females at sunset while perched above the water or stream generally 2?5 m above the forest floor Then they descend to the ground awaiting for the female Sometimes males engage in combat with each other for optimal perching sites After amplexus the mating pair then move into the leaf litter where they gradually change their body colour so as to blend with their surrounding environment The female then digs a shallow burrow in the soil and lays eggs mixing them with mud using her hind feet Early embryonic development occurs in moist mud after the pre-monsoon rains The tadpoles are free-living and aquatic
Distribution
Mercurana is endemic to India The monotypic species Mercurana myristicapalustris has been documented only in the western foothills of the Agasthyamalai Hill Range in Kerala The habitat preference is also strictly the low-elevation of swampy forest 100 to 300 m asl dominated by Myristica trees


Karlheinz Pintsch

Karlheinz Pintsch 1909 - was the long serving senior adjutant to Rudolf Hess who was the Deputy Fuhrer to Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany It fell to him to report Hess's illegal May 1941 flight to Scotland to Hitler and his recollections and notes have been the subject of debate by historians
Pintsch entered the Nazi Party in 1925 and in 1934 he became the adjutant to Hess attaining the rank of Sturmbannfuhrer major He accompanied him on visits to Augsburg-Haunstetten airfield where he was learning to fly the aircraft that he flew to Scotland on 10 May 1941 Before he departed on his mission Hess gave Pintsch a sealed letter for him to deliver personally to Adolf Hitler if he did not return within four hours and Pintsch handed it to him at the Berghof in Bavaria at noon the next day Albert Speer who was in the vicinity recalled that Hitler bellowed for Martin Bormann after reading the letter
Bormann ordered the arrest of Hess's associates and Pinstch was cashiered from the SS and interrogated by the Gestapo He was then jailed for his knowledge of the flight and held in solitary confinement as was HessÅfs other adjutant Alfred Leitgen On 7 August 1941 Hess wrote to his wife and included a letter to Pintsch in which he said he had heard rumours that he had been arrested and thanked him for his loyalty and his silence
Pintsch was released from prison in 1944 to serve on the Eastern Front and was promoted to lieutenant He was captured by the Red Army betrayed by another prisoner and interrogated by the NKVD at length They reportedly tried to elicit a confession by breaking his fingers and as a consequence he was no longer able to use a knife and fork He was released with 600 other prisoners of war at Camp Friedland Lower Saxony after 11 years in Soviet captivity on 16 December 1955 He was interviewed by Lord Beaverbrook's former private secretary the Daily Express foreign correspondent James Leasor and was interviewed for a 1962 book by Leasor that was entitled Rudolf Hess The Uninvited Envoy
A 28-page notebook written by Pintsch in captivity in 1948 was discovered in a Moscow archive in 2010 by historians It suggested that Hitler was in on the mission by Hess and interrogation transcripts found in the same archive record his recollection that when Hitler had read Hess's letter he remarked calmly At this particular moment in the war that could be a most hazardous escapade

Edmund Mills Hann

Edmund Mills Hann was a prominent figure in the industrial life of South Wales and a leading coalowner during the industrial struggles of the 1920s
He was active in local politics in the Aberdare area and an inaugural member of the Aberdare Urban District Council in 1894
Political Life
In 1889 Hann unsuccessfully sought election as a Conservative to the Glamorgan County Council but was defeated by a Liberal tradesman T.P White The result was regarded with surprise in some quarters and when White was elevated to the aldermanic bench it was felt locally that Hann would be successful in the subsequent by-election However Hann was again defeated by a different Liberal candidate Thomas Davies Hann thereafter recognised that gaining seat on the County Council in a strongly Liberal township such as Aberaman was beyond him
More locally however Hann was more successful When the Aberdare Urban District Council was established in 1894 Hann had the highest poll in the Aberaman ward and was duly elected as one of the three ward councillors He remained a member for over a decade In 1896 he became High-Constable of Aberdare He was elected the first president of Aberdare General Hospital
Business Life
Edmund Hann's mining apprenticeship was served in County Durham He was elected a member of the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers on 5 September 1868 He was then described as a Graduate member located at Hetton Colliery Fencehouses There are Hann's buried in the nearly Hillside Cemetery of Houghton-Le-Spring His route to South Wales was via Sir George Elliot 1st Baronet
Edmund Hann was deeply engaged in the mining life of South Wales as his membership entry in the South Wales Institute of Engineers shows He was the president of this institute 1903-1905 and a Gold Medallist of the institute in 1908 He had first joined this institute in 1878 The Gold Medal paper was entitled A Recent plant for the Utilisation of Small Coal this was only the second Gold Medal awarded by the institute He was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers
He was a key director in the Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Co the Rhymney Iron Company and the Taff Merthyr Steam Coal Company His Powell Duffryn directorship started in 1916 Previously by 1896 he was in the position of general manager to the Powell Duffryn Colliery Company
In 1914 Hann became chairman of The Monmouthshire and South Wales Coalowners Association At which time the Aberdare Leader reviewed his contribution to the South Wales mining industry thus At the age of 29 he was appointed manager of one of the Powell Duffryn Pits at New Tredegar being afterwards transferred to the Aberdare Valley as general manager of the company's pits there Under his supervision the Aberdare collieries soon thrived in a remarkable manner shortly afterwards Mr Hann was appointed general manager of the company's collieries in the Aberdare and Tredegar districts During the 35 years he has been connected with the company Mr Hann has seen many changes in the great concern of which he is the head now one of the most prosperous undertakings in the South Wales coalfield
As a leading mine owner Edmund Hann was on several occasions reported by the local newspapers in regard to trade disputes Examples of this took place in 1910
Home Life
Welsh tradition asserts that Hann's family came from County Durham It seems his Mother Caroline came from Sunderland County Durham though his Father a Cashier Colliery Agent came from Wallsend Newcastle Northumberland
Using his membership record in the Transactions of the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers it can be seen that in 1872 his home was Lofthouse for Loftus Cleveland In 1873-1876 his home was Brotton adjacent to Saltburn-by-the-Sea and a place where there were only ironstone mines Whereas by 1877 his home was Glanmoor Villa Uplands Swansea
It is known that in 1912 his home was The Oaklands Aberaman Aberdare By 1923-1928 his home was The Rise Llanishen Cardiff
Hann was married to Mary Ann from Crook County Durham and had a Daughter Florence who along with their first son William Reginald M.,were born while they lived in Brotton There were certainly five sons Several of them followed their father into the South Wales Mining Industry A small portrait of the family and another confirmation of the Oaklands location comes in the wedding note for the fifth son Frank Percival Hann who was married in 1913 Frank Percival Hann along with his younger brother Douglas Alfred were both born in Aberdare and from the 1901 Census it is known they had some of their education at Haileybury College near Hertford Hertfordshire They both returned to Aberman Aberdare to become Mining Engineers In the membership lists of The South Wales Institute of Engineers Proceedings Frank Percival is noted as a colliery manager elected to membership in 1905 The Edmund L Hann elected in 1902 and resident in Aberdare in the same list is another sibling this E.L Hann is likely to be the third son Edmund Lawrence Hann who is mentioned along with two other of Edmund Mills Hann's sons in his Will
Using this source the first son to follow father into the coal industry was George G Hann also of Aberdare in 1914 and first elected to this institute in 1898 Sadly George Hann predeceased his father dying in 1918
These sons can also be found in lists of company directors associated with their father So in 1928 the Rhymney Iron Co has both E L Hann and E M Hann as directors The general manager is D A Hann

Childhood and early life
Described by his mother as a shy child Scott Hutchison was raised in the Scottish Borders town of Selkirk with his brother Grant Moving to the city of Glasgow he studied illustration at the Glasgow School of Art I was there for four years and I didn't particularly want to be an illustrator so I wanted to apply the rules that I learnt to everything I do in terms of working in a bank or writing music Whilst living in Glasgow Hutchison worked in specialist whisky shop in residential area of Hyndland noting I began to appreciate and admire the heritage of flavour in a dram of single malt
Initially considering himself solely a guitarist Hutchison began singing at the age of nineteen stating Up to that point I was just a guitar player I didn't know I could sing I had been told I couldn't Hutchison's early songwriting influences included American artists Ryan Adams Wilco and Laura Cantrell with Hutchison noting When I started writing songs my references were Americana acts I could associate with those stories And you can see American folk's deep connections with Scottish folk

Studebaker-Worthington

Studebaker-Worthington was a diversified American manufacturer created in 1967 through a merger of Studebaker Wagner Electric and Worthington Corporation The company was in turn acquired by McGraw-Edison in 1979
Origins
Studebaker was once a strong automobile manufacturer but sales had been steadily declining
In December 1963 Randolph H Guthrie chairman of Studebaker
announced that the company was closing down its automobile factory in South Bend Indiana where it had made cars for 50 years but would continue to make cars in Hamilton Ontario
In 1965 auto sales they were slightly less than $45 million
On 4 March 1966 Studebaker announced that they were closing down car production
So far that year only 2,045 cars had been produced Management said the decision was due to heavy and irreversible losses in the automobile division
Business results for 1966 had total sales of $172 million excluding automobile sales
Automobile sales for 1965 had been slightly less than $45 million
Net income for 1966 was $16.4 million much more than the previous year
The company was now profitable and also had tax loss carry-forwards that made it an attractive target for a takeover
Studebaker further improved its position by selling off some unprofitable businesses The most profitable of the divisions that remained were Clarke Floor Machines Gravely Tractor Schaefer Chemical Compounds later to become STP Corporation and Onan
Formation
The 1967 merger that created the company was arranged by the entrepreneur Derald Ruttenberg who took the risk of buying Studebaker despite the liabilities that came with it including dealer warranties and union agreements He saw that Onan generators and STP engine additives were healthy businesses The large tax loss was also valuable Worthington was expected to continue to earn steady profits but could use the tax loss to avoid paying taxes
The stockholders of Studebaker and Worthington approved the merger despite rumors that the Federal Trade Commission considered the merger would be substantially anti-competitive
The combined 1966 gross revenues of the two companies had been $672 million with net income of $24.5 million
Studebaker was acquired by Wagner Electric which in turn was merged with Worthington Corporation to create Studebaker-Worthington
The merger was completed in November 1967 creating a company with $550 million of assets
The combined company included the profitable divisions from Studebaker brake and electrical automobile component manufacturing from Wagner Electric and diverse operations from Worthington that included manufacture of construction equipment valves and power generation plant
History
The former chairman of Worthington Frank J Nunlist was appointed president and chief executive officer
Randolph Guthrie of Studebaker was chairman of the new company
1967 sales were over $650 million
In January 1969 the board of directors replaced Nunlist with Derald H Ruttenberg as president and chief executive officer
Ruttenberg determined to weed out all poorly performing units
He treated the company as an investment fund and pushed the operating subsidiaries to maximize returns to shareholders reportedly demanding returns as high as 25% - 30%
The Alco Products Division a railway locomotive manufacturer became a victim of Ruttenberg's drive for profit The locomotive factory in Schenectady New York was closed in 1969 and White Motor Corporation purchased the diesel engine business in February 1970
Studebaker-Worthington retained a 52% stake in MLW-Worthington of Canada formerly the Montreal Locomotive Works
MLW-Worthington continued to build diesel locomotives mainly for the Canadian market using Alco designs
Sales at STP had exceeded $43 million in 1968 Early in 1969 Studebaker-Worthington floated STP as a public corporation listed on the American Stock Exchange
Worthington had acquired the air conditioning manufacturer Climatrol Air Coils Ltd of Oakville Ontario in 1966
Climatrol was earning $50?$60 million annually but needed large investments to grow to the size needed to compete with the giant manufacturers in the field Instead it was sold to Fedders in November 1970 Fedders was mainly interested in the brand product designs and sales force and shut down the manufacturing facilities
Weir Group a British company engaged in pump manufacture had been looking to buy Worthington as far back as 1938
In December 1968 they made an offer for the Newark-based Worthington Simpson pump manufacturer
After complex negotiations Weir acquired 50% of Worthington Simpson in 1969
A new company was established named Worthington-Weir for American pump manufacture
In 1973 Studebaker-Worthington reached sales of $1 billion
In 1974 MLW-Worthington arranged to sell 25 locomotives to Cuba for $15 million Studebaker-Worthington required a permit under the Trading with the Enemy Act which was denied The government of Pierre Trudeau protested strongly against interference by the U.S government in exports by a Canadian company
In the end the U.S government under Gerald Ford backed down and issued a license after receiving a formal note from the Canadian government that pointed out the U.S had promised to be as accommodating as possible with respect to such cases to avoid a jurisdictional conflict between the laws and policies of the two governments
McGraw-Edison purchased Studebaker-Worthington in 1978
McGraw-Edison was in turn acquired by Cooper Industries in 1985
Cummins Engine began acquisition of Onan Corp in 1986 and completed the transaction in 1992

Fire in the Blood 2013 film

Fire in the Blood is an internationally-acclaimed 2013 documentary by Dylan Mohan Gray depicting the mass devastation brought about in Africa Asia and other parts the global South due to intentional obstruction of low-cost antiretroviral drugs used for treatment of HIV/AIDS from reaching people in these countries spearheaded by Western pharmaceutical companies armed with patent monopolies and the governments above all those of the United States European Union and Switzerland doing their bidding The documentary also shows how the battle against this blockade estimated to have resulted in ten- to twelve million unnecessary deaths was fought and at least for the time being won
Fire in the Blood features contributions from former US President Bill Clinton intellectual property activist James Love global health reporter Donald McNeil Jr of The New York Times HIV/AIDS treatment activist Zackie Achmat pioneering generic drugmaker Yusuf Hamied former Pfizer executive-turned-whistleblower Peter Rost Ugandan AIDS physician Peter Mugyenyi and Nobel Prize-laureates Desmond Tutu and Joseph Stiglitz
The film is narrated by Academy-Award winning actor William Hurt who lent his voice to the film on a pro bono basis because he felt the story and subject matter were so important

It is the first Indian non-fiction feature to be theatrically released in either the US or the UK
Production
The Indian-Irish film director Dylan Mohan Gray first came to know of the issue in 2004 after he read an article in the The Economist about the battle between Big Pharma companies and the global public health community over access to lower-cost AIDS drugs for Africa He decided to make the film three years later
The film was shot on four continents from March 2008 to the end of 2010 while editing was completed in 2012
Release
The film was first released theatrically in Ireland on 21 February 2013 with the UK premiere the following day It was released theatrically in the US on 7 September 2013 and in India on 11 October the same year to outstanding reviews

Critical response
Fire in the Blood received very positive critical notices both to its North American premiere at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival as well as to its subsequent theatrical releases in Ireland Britain the USA and India
The influential film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes has given Fire in the Blood a 92% fresh rating based on 24 reviews as of January 2014 This ranks the film within the 5-10% best-reviewed films of 2013
Certain critics such as Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times while acknowledging the enormous importance of the topic felt the film should have taken a more emotional approach to its incendiary subject Many others however such as the legendary English critic Philip French who in his review for The Observer described the film as quietly devastating praised Gray's choice in avoiding a polemical tone and allowing the material to speak for itself
Writing in Sight & Sound Ashley Clark called Fire in the Blood stirring and added Gray deserves credit for his own restraint Such is the clarity of his ideological stance that any grandstanding would feel redundant
David Rooney of the Hollywood Reporter echoed this view stating that the admirable balance between impassioned argument and clear-sighted reporting in Dylan Mohan Gray's chronicle of the why and how makes Fire in the Blood indispensable viewing adding that the very smart extremely moving film is a shocking account of international trade terrorism sanctioned by Western governments and a powerful documentary that demands to be seen by as wide an audience as possible
Other reactions
Author John le Carre who became involved with the issue of pharmaceutical company abuses while researching his landmark 2001 novel The Constant Gardener called Fire in the Blood a blessing full of conviction passion and unanswerable argument
Australian-British journalist and documentary film maker John Pilger wrote Fire in the Blood is one of the most powerful important and humane documentaries I have ever seen It's the story of ordinary people standing up to unaccountable power The struggle to save millions from the ravages of untreated HIV is revealed as a struggle against the new lords of the world transnational corporations their greed and lies Genuine hope is rare these days -- you'll find it in this film
Former 2001?06 United Nations UN Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa Stephen Lewis said I was enraged as I watched thinking of those years I spent as the Envoy watching people die I rarely watch AIDS documentaries they're remarkably repetitive as a rule largely uninspired and yielding almost nothing new in the Blood is in a wholly different category a terrific riveting documentary dramatic compelling but most of all wonderfully humane is a remarkably gifted documentary film-maker
Special screenings
Special screenings of Fire in the Blood for policymakers have been held in such fora as the United Nations headquarters in New York and Vienna the European Parliament in Brussels the World Health Assembly and UNAIDS headquarters in Geneva along with dedicated screenings for lawmakers in Washington and New Delhi and one hosted by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs MEA for ambassadors and consuls accredited to India


Vought O4U Corsair

The Vought O4U Corsair was the designation applied to two different experimental biplane scout-observation aircraft Neither reached production or entered regular service
Design and development
Ordered by the United States Navy in 1930 as the third type of lightweight observation aircraft designs along with the Keystone XOK-1 and the Berliner-Joyce XOJ-1 both of which were built to BuAer Design No 86 the XO4U-1 was completed to a somewhat different specification
The Vought XO4U-1 BuNo A-8641 was built in 1931 and was Vought's first airplane with a deep monocoque two-place fuselage and had a metal and fabric-covered metal wing structure Both sets of wings joined the fuselage ahead of the pair of cockpits with the pilot seated in a cut out on the trailing edge of the shoulder-mounted slightly-swept upper wing Photos show the airframe in the factory fitted with teardrop-shaped wheel pants but exterior pictures taken during its brief existence do not show these installed Powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-1340D Wasp 9-cylinder air-cooled radial engine driving a two-bladed fixed-pitch propeller Although designed to serve either as a landplane or on floats floats had not been fitted before the prototype was destroyed
After the crash of the XO4U-1 Vought produced a new airframe which was designated the XO4U-2 and assigned the same serial carried by the XO4U-1 A-8641 although several lists of U.S Navy aircraft serials make no mention of the second design or the reuse of the Bureau of Aeronautics number The same practice was applied to the three Grumman XF3F-1 prototypes two of which crashed with all three carrying the same serial number This was actually an O3U-3 Corsair featuring that model's rounded fin and rudder an all-metal wing structure and was fitted with a cowled Pratt & Whitney R-1535 Twin Wasp Junior and first flew in June 1932 Aviation historian William T Larkins observes that under the designation system the XO4U-2 should have been a minor modification of the XO4U-1
Operational history
The sole XO4U-1 first flew in February 1931 but crashed on 28 February 1931 when test pilot Carl Harper was unable to recover from a spin Initially trapped in the cockpit by the inertia of the spin he escaped to parachute safely as the airframe came down The airframe was never delivered to the Navy
The XO4U-2 was sent to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics for testing in the 30 X 60 Full Scale Tunnel at Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory at Langley Field Virginia in April and May of 1933 where it was flown under controlled conditions Part of these tests were to evaluate the cooling of the Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp radial engine while others dealt with the relation of the slipstream to stability and control
The XO4U-2 was still listed in Status of Naval Aircraft as on strength at the Naval Aircraft Factory Philadelphia Pennsylvania as of June 1937

Cyclone Jeanett

Storm Jeanett also written as Jeanette was a strong extratropical cyclone and European windstorm which affected much of northwest Europe on 27?28 October 2002 The storm brought strong winds and heavy rainfall with wind speeds reaching up to 180?km/hr 114?mph uprooting trees smashing cars and damaging buildings The storm was responsible for a total of 33 deaths across Europe including Britain the Netherlands France Austria Belgium Denmark Poland Switzerland and Sweden The majority of the fatalities were caused by falling trees
In the United Kingdom wind gusts between 95 and 130?km/hr 60 and 80?mph were recorded with a gust of 155?km/hr 96?mph reported at Mumbles South Wales In terms of wind speed it was the biggest storm in the United Kingdom since Cyclone Oratia in October 2000 with the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute KNMI describing it as the most severe storm since the Burns Day storm of 1990
Meteorological history
Jeanett formed in the Atlantic to the south of Newfoundland following behind the path of an earlier low Irina on the 25 October The low did not explosively deepen but saw two phases of deepening first on 25 October with a second deepening phase while crossing the UK 27 October The low rapidly moved across the North Atlantic passing over Northern Ireland early in the morning 27 October before crossing over northern England and the North Sea to lie over the Southern Baltic Sea close to the Swedish island of Gotland 24 hours later Jeanett developed features of a sting jet as it crossed Britain
Jeanett was preceded by a period of high winds on 12?14 October
Impact
Strong winds of over 70?mph were experienced inland and in coastal regions winds of over 90?mph were reported The strong winds were accompanied by heavy rainfall with subsequent flooding resulting in several evacuations Flood warnings were issued for across much of Scotland and northern and eastern parts of England The highest gust was reported at the exposed coastal location of The Needles at 89kn 165?km/h Return periods of winds experienced were around 10?15 years in the London area for both the highest mean hourly winds and maximum gust speeds East Anglia also saw return periods of around 10?15 years for highest mean winds and between 5?15 years for maximum gust speeds
The worst wind related damage was experienced across Wales the English Midlands and into the Netherlands and onto western Germany At least 33 people were killed across Europe with seven fatalities in the United Kingdom Flights from all the London and Midlands airports were cancelled with many railway services also cancelled as a result of a combination of downed trees and debris on the lines and damage to overhead power lines The passenger ferry Pride of Portsmouth collided with HMS St Albans in Portsmouth Harbour as the ship was buffeted while turning across the winds
In the Netherlands the storm left four people dead AmsterdamÅfs Schipol airport was closed and damage was caused to Amsterdam Centraal railway station The strong winds caused damage from Frankfurt to Hamburg in Germany where there were eleven fatalities as a result of the storm Rail services across Germany were severely disrupted as well as flights and fallen trees were widespread The German state of North Rhine-Westphalia was particularly affected with half the deaths reported here In the state the World Heritage Site of Cologne cathedral was damaged by the high winds The German insurance company Allianz estimated that it would pay out around 80 million Euros US$ 78 million According to reports four fatalities occurred in France and a further two in Belgium in storm related incidents
Aftermath
The storm resulted in over 30 deaths many of which were the result of falling trees Significant damage to property occurred over a wide area but the most significant effect of the storm was the problems resulting for communications and transport networks throughout Europe In the UK the gales brought down power lines leaving 300,000 homes without electricity in the UK alone Transportation of all kinds was affected in the UK France Germany Austria and The Netherlands Damaged power lines and tracks blocked by falling trees affected rail services throughout Europe while on the roads commuters faced long delays
The Eurostar service between London and the continent was halted due to a technical problem as salt from the sea picked up by the wind was deposited on the isolators that connect the trains to the power cables The conductive salt left trains unable to operate until after a thorough cleaning operation had been completed after the storm's passage In the far north a ferry carrying 80 passengers was stranded for 80 hours after it failed to land at Lerwick in the Shetland Isles Heathrow airport saw over 60 flights cancelled on the 27th October
Jeanett's winds gusted up to 100?mph causing widespread damage to the electricity distribution network in England and Wales Up to two million customers were affected by loss of electricity supply at some pont because of the storms with supplies in East Anglia South West England and West Wales being particularly disrupted Most customers were reconnected within 18 hours but the Department of Trade and Industry estimated that nearly 10,000 customers were still without power on 1 November Supplies were not fully restored in the worst affected area served by EDF EnergyÅfs subsidiary company 24seven until Tuesday 5 November 10 days later
The catastrophe risk modeling firm EQECAT estimated the insured loss for Jeanette to be in excess of 1 billion Euros The most severe losses were expected in the United Kingdom Germany and The Netherlands with further substantial losses in the UK France Austria Poland Czech Republic and Slovakia Total economic losses from the storm were estimated to be twice this figure Damage caused by the stormy weather in the United Kingdom was estimated to cost up to Åí50 million US$ 75 million according to the Association of British Insurers The British Insurance BrokersÅf Association BIBA estimated that claims could reach Åí200 million $300 million
When compared to other autumn storms affecting southern England during the previous 40 years the Jeanett storm ranks first
when looking at the number of weather stations which recorded a wind gust over
