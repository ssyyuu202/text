Quilt are a three-piece psychedelic indie-rock band from Boston consisting of Anna Fox Rochinski vocals/guitars Shane Butler vocals/guitars and John Andrews vocals/drums They have released through Mexican Summer two albums an EP and a handful of singles The band tours internationally The band writes collaboratively and share vocal duties They were born out of a local improv scene and combine elements of folk-rock psychedelica and dream pop
Formation
Originally from Brookline Massachusetts Anna Fox Rochinski is the daughter of Steve Rochinski and began to play guitar at the age of 13 with her father teaching the basics right off the bat She started going to DIY shows when I was 15 or 16 years old and became part of The Whitehaus Family Record scene which led to a chance meeting with Shane Butler at one of their Friday-night sessions It was where our band formed and where we had our first practices towards the end of 2008 Both Rochinski and Butler attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston and the duo became a three-piece when Taylor McVay joined on drums in 2009 They began to play live-gigs locally mostly on the improv circuit Rochinski thought of the name while looking around the room and somehow Quilt appeared and somehow Quilt stuck In August of the same year they released a 7 track demo-tape with the help of Peter Nichols at Spooky Town
The band made their first SXSW festival appearance in March 2010 followed by the first EP Agents of Play released on a local Bostonian label in May of the same year A low-key release on vinyl it contained five tracks that highlighted the improvisational style of the band Both Butler and Rochinski graduated in June 2010 to fully concentrate on their music while they began playing shows along the East Coast McVay left the band in February 2011 and was replaced by John Andrews a New Jersey native

Upon finishing their studies Butler and Rochinki begun recording with Jesse Gallagher at his local Cambridge MA studio Initially McVay still participated in these sessions but Andrews soon began to join in what was a collaborative recording process from the outset With no budget to speak off the band recorded when they had the opportunity to do so which resulted in a number of scattered sessions over the course of a year Gallagher as the engineer and producer played an important role in the process and pulled us from the murky depths of scratchy and reverby lo-fi recording up in the heights of snazzier sounds and proper vocal treatments according to Rochinski The first result of these sessions was the single Cowboys in the Void b/w Penobska Oakwalk that appeared on Burger Records in March 2011 The band finished mixing in early September and the record was picked up by the Mexican Summer label based in New York They quickly began to ready the self-titled album for a November release Having a record-deal brought a gear-shift in public attention for the trio that found themselves booked on the CMJ convention in October as part of their label's showcase
The self-titled album began to garner some positive reviews in the alternative music media After its release the band began to tour nationwide and made foray's into Canada Over the course of 2012 the band was on the road with among others Young Magic and The Fresh & Onlys They also played the occasional support slot for among others Laetitia Sadier Improvisation remained an important part of the shows with Rochinski noting it's fun and it balances things out nicely during a live set The band also returned to SXSW where they appeared on the Mexican Summer stage and recorded a 5-track session for Daytrotter in October 2012
Held In Splendor
By the start of 2013 the band had developed plans to begin recording a follow-up Rochinski explained that while there was a strong collaborative aspect to their music for this album they brought in finished songs as well That was a first for us John and Shane and I all sing and write songs and I think the album is a very good mix of our individuality and togetherness as a cohesive piece They began rehearsing the material at The Puritan Garage in Charlestown Boston Quilt also teamed up with fellow Bostonians MMOSS to produce a split EP New Hampshire Freaks which was released in April 2013
In April 2013 the band moved to New York City to begin recording at the Mexican Summer in-house studio together with producer Jarvis Taveniere They spent a month recording invited friends who added saxophone and violin cello and steel guitar Butler explained how the experience of having the studio demoing the songs and knowing each other better as musicians helped make that happen The band continued to play live-shows and embarked on their first headlining tour in October 2013 in support of the single Arctic Shark released in the same month In January 2014 their second album Held in Splendor was released The band added Keven Lareau on bass for the headlining tour that followed They suffered a set-back when their tour van crashed in March The following month will see Quilt tour Europe for the first time

Palazzo Salviati Rome

Palazzo Salviati formerly Adimari is a palace in Rome Italy Via della Lungara 82-83
History
The palace was built in the first half of 16th century by Filippo Adimari Camerlengo of Pope Leo X on a plot of land for vineyard owned by Orazio Farnese
It is one of the greatest juvenile works by Giulio Romano The long facade is symmetrically divided into five sections by vertical bossages the big gate in the middle is surmounted by a balcony that lies on big shelves At the first floor Giulio Romano also designed a chapel in Bramante's style
In 1552 the palace was sold to Cardinal Giovanni Salviati and soon after its property was transferred to his brother Bernardo Salviati Prior of the Order of Malta in 1569 it was refurbished by Nanni di Baccio Bigio who completed the elevation to its present aspect and enlarged the rear The edifice was the residence of Cardinal Fulvio Giulio della Corgna nephew of Pope Julius III until he dead in 1583 in 1571 his famous warrior brother Ascanio della Corgna coming back from the battle of Lepanto died in the palace
In 1794 the palace passed to the House of Borghese and after other transfers of property Paccanari Lavaggi it was bought in 1840 by the Papal State and used as the seat of the city archive and of a botanical garden
After the expropriation on behalf of the Italian State in 1870 the palace housed the military court and the military college In 1933 the courtyard was closed by a new wing A shrine commemorates the military institution now suppressed
During World War II in the period of the Nazi occupation the rooms of the military college were used to lock in for some days from 16 to 17 October 1943 a thousand Jews captured during the roundput in the Roman ghetto before they were deported
The palace now houses the Istituto Alti Studi per la Difesa with an importan library specialized in military and geopolitical disciplines
In front of Palazzo Salviati formerly rose the Trastevere headboard of the Ponte dei Fiorentini an iron suspension bridge built in 1863 close to the church of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini as an additional connection between the historic centre and the new quarter of Prati then under construction It was a toll bridge realised by a French private company and the toll booth rose close to Palazzo Salviati the transit costed 20 cents 1 soldo so the bridge was popularly known as Ponte del Soldino Bridge of the Little Coin It was demolished in 1941 and replaced one year later by Ponte Principe Amedeo Savoia Aosta


Within the Law play

Within the Law is a play written by Bayard Veiller It is the story of a woman who is wrongly accused of stealing and sent to prison Upon her release she sets up a gang that engages in shady activities that are just within the law After the police try to entrap her she is mistakenly accused again this time for murder but she is vindicated when the real killer confesses
Veiller used his experience as a crime reporter to develop the play but he was initially unable to find a producer for it He finally settled on selling the rights to the play along with two others he had written for a fixed fee After an unsuccessful run in Chicago it became a huge hit on Broadway in 1912?1913 running for 541 performances It was subsequently performed by multiple road companies and adapted as a movie five times Although it was one of the biggest hits of its era Veiller got relatively little income from it due to his decision to sell it for a lump sum
Plot
In the first act word comes to the department store owned Edward Gilder that one of his former sales clerks Mary Turner has been convicted for stealing and given a three-year prison sentence Gilder is pleased because he had asked the judge to make her an example to other employees Turner asks to speak with Gilder before she goes to prison While Gilder waits for her arrival his store detective detains another woman a customer for stealing This woman is the wife of a prominent banker so rather than have her arrested Gilder apologizes to her and lets her go Turner arrives and tells Gilder she has been wrongly convicted Although she says she never stole she pleads with Gilder to increase the wages of his clerks so no one who works there will be forced to steal Gilder rejects her arguments and she leaves for prison swearing revenge on him for his treatment of her
Upon getting out of prison she sets up a gang that engages in shady activities that are just within the boundaries of the law She also marries the son of the owner of the store where she used to work A member of the gang attempts to rob the home of Turner's new father-in-law at the urging of a police stooge attempting to entrap the gang When the stooge reveals the plot the gang member kills him leaving Turner and her new husband at the scene to be found by the police It seems that Turner may go to prison again but she is saved when the guilty party confesses that she had no involvement in the crimes
History
Veiller began writing the play under the title The Miracle which he later revised to The Case of Mary Turner and finally to Within the Law In 1911 he took it to the Selwyn brothers Archie and Edgar Selwyn who brokered plays to find a producer for it Several prominent producers considered it including David Belasco George M Cohan Charles Frohman Sam Harris and Henry Wilson Savage It was repeatedly rejected The production duo of Louis Dreyfus and Herman Fellner took an option on the play but they ran into financial difficulties and the option lapsed
Seeing few prospects for his work Veiller offered to sell the rights to Within the Law and two other plays to the Selwyns for a flat fee of $3,750 about $ in dollars They eventually agreed Soon after the play attracted the interest of producer William A Brady Brady asked George Broadhurst to make some script revisions then staged a production in Chicago that opened in the spring of 1912 After a few weeks of unsuccessful results Brady was disillusioned with the play and offered to sell the rights back to the Selwyns The brothers bought it under the auspices of one of their businesses the American Play Company They were joined by several partners Lee Shubert who already had a share of the play as Brady's partner on the Chicago production Albert H Woods and Crosby Gaige Brady got $10,000 about $ in dollars enough to cover his costs for the Chicago production but a tiny fraction of what the play would later earn
Woods brought the play to his newly built Eltinge 42nd Street Theatre in New York where it was the venue's debut production The show opened at the Eltinge in September 1912 and did not leave for over a year becoming the biggest hit of the 1912-1913 Broadway season After flubbing an important line on opening night an actress bemoaned to Veiller that she had ruined his play Reflecting on the production's critical and financial success in his autobiography Veiller wished that more actresses had ruined his plays in this way Veiller earned no royalties having sold his rights for a fixed fee However the Selwyns did not want to develop a reputation for taking advantage of authors so they offered him a stipend of $100 per week for the Broadway run and $50 per week for each road company about $ and $ in dollars It was Veiller's first hit as a playwright
Productions
The play debuted at the Princess Theatre in Chicago on April 6 1912 William A Brady produced and he had George Broadhurst make revisions to the script It closed on June 22 1912
The first and most successful Broadway production opened at the Eltinge 42nd Street Theatre on September 11 1912 Holbrook Blinn directed the production and used Veiller's original script without the changes made by Broadhurst It was the first show ever staged at the Eltinge It ran for 541 performances and did not close until December 1913
After the production closed at the Eltinge multiple road companies were launched Nine different companies toured North America while another opened in the United Kingdom
A Broadway revival was staged in 1928 with Clifford Brook and Mabel Brownell directing It opened at the Cosmopolitan Theatre on March 5 1928 but closed after just 16 performances
Cast and characters
The play's protagonist and lead female role is Mary Turner a shopgirl who becomes a criminal mastermind Grace George initially accepted the part for the Chicago production but changed her mind during rehearsals and decided she did not want to play the leader of a criminal gang Emily Stevens took on the role instead
For the Broadway production Jane Cowl was cast as Turner Cowl specialized in portraying tearful women and considered her skills well-adapted for the role Helen Ware filled in for Cowl when she took a brief vacation from the production's long run
Actor William B Mack appeared in both the Chicago and Broadway productions both times playing Joe Garson the gang member responsible for the shooting
The characters and cast from the Broadway production are given below
Reception

Box office

The New York Times review of the Broadway production predicted that the play was sure of being extremely successful This prediction was accurate as the show became a huge hit The opening night had multiple curtain calls and by the second night the theater was so packed that Veiller could not enter to watch the performance In 1914 Walter Reynolds called it the greatest success of any modern melodrama produced in the metropolis and in 1915 theater journalist Rennold Wolf said it was possibly the most profitable play of our generation By 1917 productions in the United States had taken in revenues of about $ $ in dollars

Church of St Mary Abbas and Templecombe

The Anglican Church of St Mary at Templecombe within the English county of Somerset was built in the 12th century and is a Grade II* listed building
The parish is part of the benefice of Abbas and Templecombe Henstridge and Horsington within the archdeaconry of Wells
History
One of the manors within the parish was held by Earl Leofwine who gave it to Bishop Odo of Bayeux after the Norman Conquest The church was probably established during the period when the manor was held by Shaftesbury Abbey but granted to the Knights Templar while it was held by his descendant Serlo FitzOdo who established a preceptory in the village in 1185 The preceptory served as an administrative centre for the lands held by the Templars in the south west of England and Cornwall It may also have been used to train men and horses for the Crusades After the Knights Templar were suppressed following the 1307 order by Pope Clement IV it was granted to the Knights of St John who held it until the dissolution of the monasteries
Parts of the original 12th-century church remain however it underwent a major Victorian restoration in the 19th century which included complete rebuilding of the chancel and the addition of the vestry The foundations of the tower are probably Saxon
The church was damaged by bombing in World War II Four bombs falling near the church on its southern side damaged some of the arches in the nave along with the roof and tower breaking some of the windows and damaging the organ
Architecture
The stone church is dressed with Hamstone with clay tile roofs It has a two-bay chancel four-bay nave and a south transept The entrance porch is at the southern end of the church at the base of the two-stage tower The buttresses were added after the tower was built The oldest bell in the tower was cast at the Salisbury foundry around 1420 Two bells of 1656 were cast by Robert Purdue with two from 1736 by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family The most recent bell is from 1891
In the churchyard is a high stone cross which serves as the war memorial for the village
Interior
The font was made from Purbeck Marble in the 12th century however the cover is from 1897 A cup and cover from 1628 two salvers made by Anthony Nelson in 1725 and a flagon from 1845 are included in the church plate
The Templecombe Head
In the church is a painting on wooden boards of a head which was discovered in the roof of an outhouse of a local building in 1945 The tenant of the cottage was collecting wood in an outhouse where part of the ceiling had fallen down She noticed a face above her which was on a wooden panel fixed by wire to the inside of the roof and previously plastered over
The painting is thought to be from the 13th century and connected with the Templecombe Preceptory or Combe Templariorum which was established in the village in 1185 It was given to the church in 1956
Restoration work in the 1950s and again in the 1980s has identified gold stars on the picture and microscopic evidence for bright colours which are no longer in evidence The colours were present in the 1940s when it was discovered but impaired when the local vicar cleaned it in his bath with Vim The addition of a keyhole and hinges at some time in the past suggests it was used as a door
For many years the head has been believed to be that of Christ but without the halo which was the norm in religious iconography at the time The Knights Templar were suppressed partly because of their use of the image of Christ without the halo There has been speculation linking the image with the Shroud of Turin Other explanations suggest the image is not of Christ but of John the Baptist

Wali Ahmad Sandakai Mulla

Wali Ahmad(Pashto??? ???? known as Sandakai Mulla),was a religious cleric extremist and reformer who played the role of king maker and king breaker in the formation of Swat State
Early life and education
Wali Ahmad was born at Sandakai a small village in Chakisar Swat Born in a religious family he was given religious education locally He proceeded to Madrasah-i-Deoband for higher studies He then visited Makkah for the performance of Hajj and travelled to Syria Baghdad and other centers of Muslim civilization
Anti British movement
Wali Ahmad returned from abroad and opened a religious school Madrasah at Tahkal Peshawar In those days Haji Sahib of Turangzai was working against the British Wali Ahmad was very much inspired by Haji Sahib He went to Swat in 1910,and organized the people in Swat and Kohistan against the British
Reformation of society
Wali Ahmad Sandakai Mullah was against the aberrations in Islamic customs and rituals prevalent in Swat So he continued to struggle for the formation of an Islamic government in Swat He built a force of fifty to sixty shaykhs disciples equipped with latest weapons and were ready for every kind of action ordered by their pir religious leader He established his own mobile Shari'at Court where he tried to compensate and remove the grievances of people He declared many prevalent practices such as Qada Umri Iskhat and visiting shrines of saints etc as innovations in Islam
His role in the formation of Swat State
At that time there was no government and central controlling authority in Swat Wali Ahmad wanted a united government of Swat to eliminate the influence of the Nawab of neighboring Dir The Khans of Swat supported him The people of upper Swat under the command of Sandakai Mullah defeated the Nawab in 1914 which made the former a political leader Sandakai Mullah was desirous f having a centralized organization Swat Thus,Syed Abdul Jabbar Shah of Sithanah was made ruler of Swat in 1915 But he could not managed to protect Swat from the attacks of Nawab of Dir Sandakai Mullah who had first brought and made Abdul Jabbar Shah as king in Swat drove him out and enthroned Miangul Abdul Wadud as the ruler of Swat thus playing the role of king maker and king breaker
The fate of Sandakai Mulla
With the passage of time his relations with Miangul Abdul Wadud also became strained He again focused his attention on the eradication of innovations and un-Islamic rituals He re-established his mobile Shari'at Court and executed his orders The Badshah Sahib considered his presence and influence as serious threat to his power So he wanted to reduce and diminish his role and influence Miangul Abdul Wadud sent him his men and threatened him to leave Swat or he will be killed The Badsha had now become so strong that nobody could challenge him
So ultimately Sandakai Mullah left Swat in 1920 and settled in Kohan Dir where he died a natural death in 1356 A H The man died issueless penniless and homeless but left a mark to be remembered by the later generations


Made Made Snana

Made Made Snana ??? ??? ????? also Made Snana is a religious practice observed in some Hindu temples of Karnataka Made ??? in Tulu Language refers to the left-overs after a meal and the word Snana"(????? in Kannada & Tulu means bath
Practice
Temples in South India hold communal meals for people of all sects during special religious occasions These meals are typically of the traditional South Indian variety where people are served food over plantain leaves on the temple floor The ritual of Made Made Snana involves devotees rolling over the plantain leaves once food has been partaken by Brahmins and other devotees The devotees then take a Holy dip in the nearby Kumaradhara River after which the ritual is said to be complete The practice is said to be more than 500 years old
It is believed that the ritual rids one of bad Karma skin diseases and other ailments
Made Made Snana is predominantly practiced on certain festive days in Subramanya temples of Karnataka but has also been performed at vaishnavite places such as the Krishna Math Udupi The practice is actively practiced in the Kukke Subramanya Temple and in the Subramanya temples of Kalavara Kundapura Taluk and Ramanathapura Hassan District
The constitutional status of the practice has yet to be decided in the Indian courts
Controversy
The practice in the prominent Kukke Subramanya Temple has generated controversy in the State of Karnataka where certain groups are demanding a ban on the practice despite strident opposition from the very community the groups claims to represent
The practice is generally performed by Hindus of all varna including the Brahmins The protestors however claim to be campaigning against Dalit oppression at the hand of Upper-caste Hindus especially the Brahmins
Pejawar Swami has also expressed opposition to the continued practice of the ritual It has also been reported that neither the Government of Karnataka nor the Kukke Subramanya Temple administration endorses the continued practice of the ritual
The imposition of a ban however has been challenged in the courts by the very community the protestors claim to be defending It has been continually challenged in the court by the Rajya Adivasi Budakattu Hitharakshana Vedike"(????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ?????? a tribal Adivasi classified as Dalit rights group who have questioned the motives in banning a practice voluntarily undertaken by people from all walks of life
It has also been reported that members from the forest tribe Malekudiyas who traditionally decorate the Temple Ratha for the procession refused to do so were the stay on the practice not lifted Udayavani reports a member of the community as saying
Not surprisingly the practice continues to draw devotees from all over the state while simultaneously drawing harsh condemnation on the Internet
Government action
The Government of Karnataka sought to bypass the courts by including a provision banning the practice in the Anti-Superstition bill tabled -and subsequently dropped- in the Winter assembly of 2014 The legislation also included draconian laws which allowed the state to gain administrative control of Hindu Temples & Mutts over arbitrary transgressions
The bill contrasts with the Communal violence bill of the Congress Party at the Centre which if enacted would've blamed Hindus by default for instances of communal violence even though statistics support exactly the opposite The Government of Karnataka controlled by the Congress Party has also failed to mention anything about the Homeopathic colleges some of which are funded by the state government nor was a ban on such colleges promulgated in the Anti-Superstition bill
The Congress Party & its allies which includes the CPI(M have therefore been accused of causing social strife by raising needless anti-Hindu anti-Brahmin sentiments for political gain It should be noted in this context that the Chief-Minister of Karnataka Siddaramaiah belongs to the Kuruba community one of the dominant groups in Karnataka politics the other being Lingayats Brahmins form the lowest income group in Karnataka and consequently insignificant in its political discourse

EMA401

EMA401 is a new drug under development for the treatment of peripheral neurophatic pain It was recently established as a potential drug option for patients suffering pain caused by postherpetic neuralgia It may also be useful for treating various types of chronic neuropathic pains caused by lesions and other diseases affecting the somatosensory system in addition to postherpetic neuralgia EMA401 has been implicated in alleviating pains associated with a host of neural abnormalities ranging from excessive nerve sprouting due to damaged nerve caused by shingles diabetes osteoarthritis HIV and chemotherapy EMA401 is a competitive antagonist of angiotensin II type 2 receptor ATR being developed by the Australian biotechnology company Spinifex Pharmaceuticals It is the S-enantiomer form of the racemate drug EMA400 Analgesic treatments currently available for pain disorders are unsuited for severe chronic neuropathic pains EMA401 is more effective and has virtually no central nervous system side effects in comparison to current drugs for pain relief such as Neurotin and Lyrica Pain pathways of the other functional systems have major molecular and mechanistic differences compared to pain pathways of the peripheral nervous system EMA401 target proteins angiotensin II type 2 receptors are extremely important for nociception within the peripheral nervous system and less so for nociception within other functional systems EMA401 is the first drug on the market that targets angiotensin II type 2 receptors ATR with high affinity but has a low affinity for angiotensin II type 1 receptors Angiotensin II receptor antagonists that have existed in the pharmaceutical market have had higher affinities for angiotensin II type 1 receptors ATR over type 2 receptors ATR are not involved with nociception ATR antagonists have been mostly used for the treatment of hypertension
History of drug development
Angiotensin II is an octapeptide hormone central to the renin-angiotensin system.It regulates blood pressure control water fluid homeostasis and neuronal excitability Receptor agonists and antagonist of angiotensin II receptors that target various parts of the complicated renin-angiotensin system were developed to increase knowledge of the renin-angiotensin system and aid the development of antihypertensive drug candidates These investigations led to the discovery of two subtypes of membrane bound G protein-coupled angiotensin receptors within the renin-angiotensin system with vastly different functions angiotensin II type 1 receptors ATR and angiotensin II type 2 receptors ATR ATR is the receptor subtype that was found to be mainly responsible for blood pressure water fluid regulation and other classical known physiological actions of angiotensin II on the renin-angiotensin system Drugs that antagonize ATR have become used as common treatments for hypertension and congestive heart failure Functions of ATR were unknown in comparison
Development of selective ATR agonists and antagonists aided the discovery of ATRsÅf functional roles within the nervous system 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-]pyridine derivatives were the first compounds described to have antagonizing properties at the AT2 receptors Inventors at Warner-Lambert Company LLC substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline with various functional groups to create numerous compounds of formula I that had improved affinity for ATR EMA400 the racemate drug to EMA401 was originally Compound 6 one of the 48 compounds of formula I Compound 6 had higher binding affinity for ATR compared to the other 48 compounds with an IC value of 2.8 nM in a rabbit uterus binding assay It was also inactive in the ATR binding assay at concentrations of 10-5 M suggesting high selectivity for ATR Example 47 the S-enantiomer of Compound 6 and later named EMA401 was at the time an unanalyzed compound of formula I Compound 6 under the name PD-126,055 and five other ATR antagonists PD-123,319 L-159,686 PD-121,981 L-161,638 and L-163,579 were reported to have previously unknown analgesic properties by investigators from the University of Queensland Greater understanding of the pathobiology of neuropathic pain had been and still is of high demand as is better neuropathic pain relief medication By 2020 the neuropathic pain treatment market is projected to reach $3.6 billion USD The report on those six drugs was the first to clearly elucidate the role of angiotensin II type 2 receptors in neuropathic pain and implicated ATR antagonists as potential drugs for the treatment of neuropathic pain
Angiotensin II AT2 receptors are produced locally in nociceptive tissues Nociceptive neurons express only ATR not ATR PD-123,319 commonly used in early angiotensin II research for its moderate inhibition of ATR blocks angiotensin II induced neuronal excitability in cultured cells of neuronal origins and also in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons from adult rats The family of small molecule inhibitors of angiotensin II activity on ATR EMA200 PD-123,319 EMA300 PD-121,981 and EMA400 PD-126,055 relieved hindpaw sensitivity in a rat model of neuropathic pain in a recent study conducted at University of Queensland Relief of hindpaw hypersensitivity was dose dependent EMA400 had the highest antineuropathic potency 60-fold more potent than EMA300 and 250-fold more potent than EMA200 EMA400 had an IC of 75.2 nM for rat ATR and an IC of 2.9x10 nM for rat ATR EMA400 a racemate was separated into EMA401 the S-enantiomer of EMA400 and EMA402 the R-enantiomer of EMA400 EMA401 had an IC of 39 nM for human ATR compared to EMA402 with an IC of 1,100 nM for human ATR EMA401 was selected as the candidate drug for neuropathic pain treatment for clinical development
Animal studies five Phase I clinical trials unpublished data at Spinifex Pharmaceuticals implicated a dose range of 10?50?mg per day of EMA401 to be effective on human beings Phase I clinical trial also indicated EMA401 dose of up to 400?mg to be safe Spinifex Pharmaceuticals reported the results of a phase 2 clinical trial results in which 183 patients with postherpetic neuralgia received either oral EMA401 or placebo for 28 days Those assigned to the active condition receiving EMA401 reported significantly less postherpetic neuralgia a chronic neuropathic pain compared to those in the placebo condition There was no evidence of any serious side effects caused by EMA401 Spinifex Pharmaceuticals plans to proceed with larger phase II clinical trial to test higher doses for longer periods of time A nonrandomized Phase 2 study of EMA401 for the treatment of pain in patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy was approved and is currently underway
Mechanism of action
Nociceptive pain is immediate pain felt as a result of injury inflicted upon tissue Neuropathic pain in contrast is long-lasting pain that develops when the peripheral and the central nervous system are sensitized following injury to these systems Neuropathic pain may be continuous pain spontaneous or pain caused by hypersensitivity to non-nociceptive levels of stimulus
Angiotensin II AngII is an octapeptide that regulates blood pressure controls water fluid balance and pain perception It activates two membrane bound G protein-coupled receptors angiotensin II type 1 receptors ATR and angiotensin II type 2 receptors ATR AgnII co-localization with substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide implies its role in nociception ATR the receptor mainly responsible for AngII's effect on the pain mechanisms within the nervous system is expressed in the dorsal root ganglion DRG as well as human trigeminal ganglia These receptors are locally produced inside DRG neurons implying the presence of an intrinsic angiotensinergic system Injured nerves and painful neuromas show higher ATR expression compared to normal undamaged nerves AngII contributes to neuropathic pain by potentiating neuronal pathways that signal pain when AngII activates ATR expressed on pain detecting neurons AngII potentiates neuronal pathways by increasing neurite length and density in DRG neurons AngII potentiates neuronal pathways by sensitizing nociceptors as well Nociceptor sensitization suggests a decreased thresholds for activation of nociceptors ATR activation increases kinase levels in DRG neurons such as levels of PKA PKC and MAPK via G protein-coupled receptor-activated second messenger pathways These phosphorylating enzymes sensitize major voltage-gated ion channels found on DRG neurons Sensitization increases neuronal excitation following receptor channel activation EMA401 antagonized human ATR with a Ki of 5.4 nM IC of 39 nM and a Hill coefficient of 1.3 EMA401 alleviates pain and provides relief by blocking the AngII induced potentiation
TRPV1 is an example a nociceptor that's sensitization is inhibited by EMA401 Clinical conditions of chronic pain shows up-regulated TRPV1 expression The transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 TRPV1 is a ligand-gated non-selective cation channel found in sensory neurons that allows the sensation and perception of heat and other noxious stimuli Opening of TRPV1 channels lead to the influx of Na and Ca causing the nociceptive neuron to depolarize The direct phosphorylation of TRPV1 channelÅfs Ser116 residue by cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA sensitizes the TRPV1 channel cAMP signals PKA to phosphorylate TRPV1 Phosphorylated TRPV1 has a lower threshold for activation causing potentiation of its neuronal pathways Activation of the ATR increases cAMP levels resulting in higher numbers of phosphorylated TRPV1 This causes behavioral hypersensitivity of TRPV1 to its stimuli Increased ATR activity causes hyperalgesia ATR antagonist EMA401 inhibits the downstream effects of ATR activation including an increase in cAMP Fewer TRPV1 are phosphorylated when treated with EMA401 both reversing and/or preventing potentiation that causes hyperalgesia AngII increases neuronal excitability to TRPV1 channel activation EMA401 inhibits this increase in excitability in a dose dependent manner producing analgesic effects
Pharmacokinetics
EMA401 is the sodium-salt form of S)-2-(diphenylacetyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-methoxy-5-(phenylmethoxy)- 3-isoquinoline carboxylic acid EMA401 dose of up to 400?mg was tested in healthy male adults without any presentation of complications indicating safety issues EMA401 has been administered orally at a standardized dose of 100?mg twice daily EMA401 reaches a maximum plasma concentration of 1000?ug/L one-hour after administration of 100?mg of EMA401 in both men and women as observed in a phase II trial EMA401 has a t of 6 hours on day 1 of drug intake and a t of 12 hours on day 7 of drug intake AUC averages around 1400 hr*ug/L at the given dose Total plasma concentration of EMA401 is consistent over 28 days A steady state of minimum drug plasma concentration is reached by the 8th day of being on the drug EMA401 does not accumulate in the blood at presently administered doses EMA401 does not cross the blood-brain barrier therefore has little effect on the central nervous system Blood circulation delivers the drug to the dorsal root ganglion located on the dorsal root of the spine
Adverse effects
No serious adverse effects have been determined that directly associates with EMA401 Slightly higher frequency of complaints such as pharyngitis headaches and allergic dermatitis are reported by individuals taking EMA401 However pharyngitis was only reported in the placebo group of the phase 1 trial while no allergic dermatitis was reported in phase 1 Headache frequency was higher in patients receiving EMA401 over placebo in both phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials for EMA401 The mechanism of why EMA401 may increases frequency of headaches is unknown It is possible that a small amount of EMA401 is crossing the blood-brain barrier and affecting some functions of the CNS in the few patients that showed side-effects to EMA401 In consideration of the fact that the renin-angiotensin system regulates pressure within the cardiovascular system patients taking EMA401 did not show any difference in vital signs or 12-lead ECG assessments compared to the patients taking placebo
Synthesis of EMA401
The following is a summary of the original synthesis of EMA401 described in detail in US5246943A More modified protocols have recently been established to synthesize EMA401 at a larger scale 2-benzyloxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde beta-alanine and hydantoin are stirred in glacial acetic acid for several hours to produce 5-[(Example 3 Example 3 is treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid and heated to protonate the C-C double bond between the hydantoin group and the central benzene ring to create the racemate RS)-5-[[3-Methoxy- 2-(phenylmethoxy)phenylmethyl]-2,4-imidazolidinedione Example 6 The hydantoin group is then hydrolyzed by heating Example 6 in sodium hydroxide solution to yield the racemic amino acid RS)-3-Methoxy-2-(phenylmethoxy)phenylalanine Example 9 Example 9 is then treated with methylal in a hydrochloric acid solution overnight to form RS)-1,2,3,4-Tetrahydro-6-methoxy-5- phenylmethoxy-3-isoquinolinecarboxylic acid Example 13 Example 13 is dissolved in a methylene chloride solution treated with tetramethylammonium hydroxide and diphenylacetyl chloride to form RS)-2-(Diphenylacetyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-methoxy-5-(phenylmethoxy)-3-isoquinolinecarboxylic acid Example 20 aka Compound 6 PD-126,055 EMA400
In order to separate out the S-enantiomer of Example 20 from the racemate Example 20 is dissolved in ethyl acetate and treated with chiral resolution reagent 1(-)-Éø-methylbenzylamine Adding petroleum ether induces the crystallization of the less soluble diastereomeric salt the S-enantiomer of Example 20 Example 47 Deprotonated salt-crystals of the S-enantiomer Eample 47 are filtered dissolved and protonated in methanol and treated with 1% potassium bisulfate solution to precipitate out the free carboxylic acid Example 47 This chiral end product is S)-(+)-2-(Diphenylacetyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-methoxy-5-(phenylmethoxy)-3-isoquinolinecarboxylic acid the neutral form of the deprotonated sodium-salt that is EMA401


K-D-B-tree

In computer science a K-D-B-tree k"-dimensional B-tree is a tree data structure for subdividing a k"-dimensional search space The aim of the K-D-B-tree is to provide the search efficiency of a balanced k-d tree while providing the block-oriented storage of a B-tree for optimizing external memory accesses
Informal description
Much like the k"-d tree a K-D-B-tree organizes points in k"-dimensional space useful for tasks such as range-searching and multi-dimensional database queries K-D-B-trees subdivide space into two subspaces by comparing elements in a single domain Using a 2-D-B-tree 2-dimensional K-D-B-tree as an example space is subdivided in the same manner as a k"-d tree using a point in just one of the domains or axes in this case all other values are either less than or greater than the current value and fall to the left and right of the splitting plane respectively
Unlike a k"-d tree each half-space is not its own node Instead as in a B-tree nodes in the K-D-B-tree are stored as pages and the tree stores a pointer to the root page
Structure
The K-D-B-tree contains two types of pages
Page overflows occur when inserting an element into a K-D-B-tree results in the size of a node exceeding its optimal size Since the purpose of the K-D-B-tree is to optimize external memory accesses like those from a hard-disk a page is considered to have overflowed or be overfilled if the size of the node exceeds the external memory page size
Throughout insertion/deletion operations the K-D-B-tree maintains a certain set of properties
Operations on a K-D-B-tree
Queries
Queries on a K-D-B-tree are a range search over intervals in all domains or axes in the tree This collection of intervals is called the query region In k"-space the query region can be visualized as a bounding volume around some subspace in the entire k"-dimensional search space A query can fall into one of three categories
Insertions
Since an insertion into a K-D-B-tree may require the splitting of a page in the case of a page overflow it is important to first define the splitting operation
Splitting algorithm
First a region page is split along some plane to create two new region pages the left and right pages These pages are filled with the regions from the old region page and the old region page is deleted Then for every region child in the original region page remembering child is a page and region specifies an actual bounding region
Insertion algorithm
Using the splitting algorithm insertions of a new point location pair can be implemented as follows
It is important to take care in the domain and element chosen to split page by since it is desirable to try to balance the number of points on either side of the splitting plane In some cases a poor choice of splitting domain can result in undesirable splits It is also possible that a page cannot be split by a certain domain
Deletions
Deletions from a K-D-B-tree are incredibly simple if no minimum requirements are placed on storage utilization Using an exact match query to find a point location pair we simply remove the record from the tree if it exists
Reorganization algorithm
Since deletions can result in pages that contain very little data it may be necessary to reorganize the K-D-B-tree to meet some minimum storage utilization criteria The reorganization algorithm to be used when a page contains too little data is as follows
Related Work
Like in a k"-d tree updates in a K-D-B-tree may result in the requirement for the splitting of several nodes recursively This is incredibly inefficient and can result in sub-optimal memory utilization as it may result in many near-empty leaves Lomet and Salzberg proposed a structure called the hB-tree holey brick tree to improve performance of K-D-B-trees by limiting the splits that occur after an insertion to only one root-to-leaf path This was achieved by storing regions not only as rectangles but as rectangles with a rectangle removed from the center
More recently the Bkd-tree was proposed as a means to provide the fast queries and near 100% space utilization of a static K-D-B-tree Instead of maintaining a single tree and re-balancing a set of formula_1 K-D-B-trees are maintained and rebuilt at regular intervals In this case formula_2 is the size of the memory buffer in number of points


Pilot American Dad

The pilot episode of American Dad aired on February 6 2005 after Super Bowl XXXIX by the FOX Broadcasting Company The episode follows Stan who rigs a school election to make his son Steve popular but he becomes drunk with power and ends up going crazy The episode was written by series co-creators Seth MacFarlane Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman The episode features a guest appearance by Carmen Electra
Seth MacFarlane who his best known for creating Family Guy stated that he and Weitzman came up with the series after the 2000 United States presidential election Initially the series was to replace Family Guy after its cancellation but was revived after the pilot episode aired Because of this MacFarlane left the show and handed creative control other to Barker and Weitzman After the pilot aired the rest of the first season began on May 1 2005 on Fox's Animation Domination lineup which had its debut on that date
The pilot received mixed reviews from critics and fans with many people calling American Dad a rip off of Family Guy Despite the mixed reviews it was a ratings success According to the Nielsen ratings it was viewed by 15.10 million people in the United States and required a 7.5 rating in the 18-49 demographic It is rated TV-PG
Plot
In the pilot Steve is upset about his lack of popularity He notices that girls seem attracted to guys with dogs so he asks his parents for one Stan gets Steve a 19-year-old dog because it was alive during the Reagan administration One night Roger the Alien makes a noise and Stan goes downstairs thinking it is an intruder Stan shoots the intruder only to find out that he just accidentally killed Steve's dog
They bury the dog and Stan tries to make up for it by rigging the school election and discrediting his opponent by showing an altered photo of her in bed with the Jack in the Box Man who Stan tells Steve and Roger later discovers is still in their basement so that Steve wins and becomes the school president Once elected Steve uses his attribution as student body president to impress the head cheerleader He gets drunk with power but believes that he is succeeding until she dumps him when he first tries to kiss her Steve goes crazy and holds the school hostage Stan sneaks into the school and gets Steve to stop by revealing that he was unpopular in high school as well
On another front the audience is introduced to Roger an alien who saved Stan's life in Area 51 As repayment Roger lives with the Smiths but his presence is ignored by the CIA Stan's employer and the world Since Stan fears that the CIA would erase his and Roger's memories if the alien were ever discovered Roger is forced to live in confinement at the Smith's Roger is also addicted to sugar and Francine puts him on a forced diet when his weight causes him to break a chair and the dinner table In order to get around Francine's strict control of candies in the house Roger strikes a deal with Hayley to do her homework in exchange for her smuggling sweets to him It works at first but on the night before the deadline for one of Hayley's papers on Henry Kissinger Roger has too much sugar and passes out without doing the work He and Hayley are able to come up with an excuse to make her teacher give her an extension on the paper's deadline they dig up Steve's dead dog and Hayley tells the teacher that she just lost her dog After this scare however Hayley decides to discontinue her agreement with Roger Roger noticing Steve's frustration in getting a girl becomes his adviser for dating in exchange for boatloads of candy Roger also reveals that every seven hours an ooze shoots out of his body like clockwork
Background and Production
In 1999 Family Guy MacFarlane's first animated show aired on FOX to ratings success During this time MacFarlane came up with the idea for American Dad after the 2000 presidential election stating me and co-creator Matt Weitzman were so frustrated with the Bush administration that we would just spend days bitching and complaining and we figured we should channel this into something creative and hopefully profitable Later series co-creator Mike Barker stated About a year and a half ago Seth called and asked if Matt and I would be interested in working on a show about a right-wing CIA agent and his liberal daughter It was right up our alley and everything just fell into place On September 14 2003 Variety reported that Fox Broadcasting had ordered a pilot presentation of the then tentatively titled American Dad and If greenlit American Dad could launch as early as fall 2004 At the time Fox was aiming to develop a new lineup of adult animated sitcoms

Reception
The pilot episode received mixed reviews from critics In a review of American Dad Volume 1 DVD Michael Drucker of IGN stated that it's occasionally weighed down with its topical humor Characters are extremely polarized especially Stan and Hayley and the constant flow of jokes about their politics can become tiring The New York Times's Alessandra Stanley said the show aspires to pick up where The Simpsons and South Park left off but many of its jokes and cultural references seem off Robert Bianco of USA Today said If you like Family Guy you'll probably like American Dad The problem is if you've seen Family Guy you've already seen American Dad In a negative review Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times said The jokes aren't funny the story is silly or really not silly enough and the new writers follow the Family Guy model so closely they fail to explain any of the characters or even the premise of the show
According to the Nielsen ratings it was viewed by 15.10 million people in the United States and required a 7.5 rating in the 18-49 demographic

The two were killed in the November 2008 Mumbai attacks by terrorists who attacked the Mumbai Chabad House where the couple served as emissaries Avraham said that at the time of the attack We didn't know that there were terrorists in Chabad House We called and called but Gabi and Rivka didn't answer and then suddenly we saw on TV what happened there Avraham was 14 years old at the time
She and her family were drawn so close to the Jewish people that in the wake of the attack and the killings of their friends they converted to Judaism and immigrated to Israel one year after the attack
Immigration to Israel
They settled in the West Bank/Judea Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba south of Jerusalem on the outskirts of Hebron where she now lives Noting that while in India it was risky to leave her house after 8 p.m Avraham said I feel like I am the luckiest person in the world here I feel safe and happy People here helped us very much I will live here for my whole life

Thai boxing career
While studying at the religious girls school in Kiryat Arba Avraham decided to take up sports
Fitness trainer Michael Pollack from the Jewish neighborhood in neighboring Hebron integrated her training with kickboxing He put Avraham in touch with Thai boxing coach Eddie Yusopov who became her trainer
Avraham trains in Muay Thai boxing five times a week at the boxing center at Jerusalem's Teddy Stadium As is the case with most Israeli athletes she does not receive any funding To pay for her training NIS 230 a month and trips abroad for competitions since she does not like to ask for money I still remember how we had nothing when we got here she cleans houses and also works as a dog walker and waitress In addition Avraham hitchhikes to her practices in Jerusalem as she does not have money to take the bus Because she is religious she brings kosher food with her when she travels to fights
2012 Israeli Champion
In September 2012 a year after she began training professionally Avraham won the Israeli national womenÅfs Thai boxing championship in her weight class of 57?63 kilos 125?140 pounds at the age of 18
Pollack said She draws her strength from where we live in Kiryat Arba This gives her an inner strength that explodes in the ring As to her skills he observed Sarah has tremendous legs and she's flexible ? she reaches the head with her kicks It's very impressive when Sarah goes into battle
2014 World Champion
In early 2014 while still in high school Avraham won the Women's World Thai-Boxing Championship in Bangkok Thailand in her 57?63 kilos 125?140 pounds weight class
Her trainer is still trying to work on one aspect of her approach observing
Before fights Sarah makes friends with her opponent She goes over to her hugs her I tell her she can hug afterward not during the competition She can say hello as one athlete to another But that's the way she is
That's what I want to get out of her for her not to be so naive for her to be nasty in her approach and in the fight itself Avraham said smiling What can I do I'm nice I love everyone But what happens outside the ring doesn't affect what happens in it
Thai boxing has not been recognized as an Olympic sport but efforts are being made to change that before the 2016 Olympic Games


Grove Lime Kiln

Grove Lime Kiln is a disused lime kiln on the Isle of Portland Dorset England It is situated within The Grove village and is owned by the prison service the nearby Young Offenders Institution HM Prison Portland The lime kiln is found 320 metres north-west of St Peter's Church and has been Grade II Listed since January 2009
History
Upon the inception of the prison various quarries were opened up within the Grove area for convicts to work in A large majority of Portland's landscape is strongly influenced by the remains of past quarrying as well as related transport and tramway systems as well as subsidiary industries such as lime production As a result of this many lime kilns would be built to produce quicklime through the calcination of limestone The Grove Lime kiln dates from circa 1900 with the prison first opening in 1848 The lime kiln is one of at least six individual examples on Portland that existed between 1864 and 1902 built to process limestone from the surrounding quarries The lime kiln was constructed and operated by prisoners from the Portland Convict Establishment now the Young Offenders Institution When the prisoners were first brought to Portland in 1848 they formed a valuable workforce on the island The convicts would be employed in quarrying and general construction work and this was originally to provide stone for the construction of Portland Harbour's breakwaters and the Verne Citadel The conditions in the prison and its quarries during the latter half of the 19th century were a major catalyst for penal reform in this country and many prisoners died while quarrying stone Within The Grove village and surrounding areas local entrepreneurs living adjacent to the prison quarries would charge visitors to view the prisoners at work from the upper windows of their houses In 1921 the government decided to convert the prison into a Borstal Institution and as a result the quarry and associated masonry works closed It is likely that lime production at the Grove Lime kiln also ceased at about this time
Built of a limestone facing with a rubble core the lime kiln is situated against an enhanced bank with a charging ramp to the right side to facilitate the loading of the kiln with fuel and broken limestone The design of the building has a tapering cylindrical form with the charging ramp being more rectangular in plan When originally active the lime kiln was sited at the north end of a stone dressing yard all set within a walled enclosure This yard was principally used for dressing stone and was located within the south western part of the disused Admiralty Quarry Since this yard closed several rectangular single storey buildings associated tramways and a large proportion of the boundary wall were demolished The 19th century prison wall along with a huge rock outcrop of highly significant geological importance - Withies Wall - was demolished in June 1993 by the quarry owner of the time despite not seeking permission or having any regard for the scheduled status of the wall This Victorian security wall had old sentry posts There was local outcry following this event and today only a small section of the wall remains
Within the exterior of the building the ashlar kiln pot still survives and is approximately of it original full height At both west and east sides of the lime kiln are segmental-headed arched openings with keystones to the two draw holes and at the northern rear of the lime kiln is a segmental-headed outer arch to a stoke hole which retains the cast-iron surround to a fire grate A battered charging ramp remains and has a rubble core with a facing of coursed rock-faced limestone though some of the facing on the principal south elevation has collapsed This is keyed into the building near the left hand end The lime kiln holds three semi-circular arched openings to the south elevation of the ramp and these were most likely to have been used for storage and shelter The western end has a passageway with segmental-headed archways at either end and this provides access to the rear side of the structure The lower part interior of the lime kiln contains some rubble but the single-cell tapering chamber remains complete for most part
In 2009 the lime kiln was designated at Grade II for a number of principal reasons The lime kiln remains a well-preserved and distinctive feature of the lime industry and an interesting example of this type of industrial structure It is an important survival and one of the last vestiges of lime production in Portland and is of special historic interest for its location and association with the once thriving internationally significant Portland quarries Additionally it represents a significant physical record of the role of convict labour in the industries on the island during the 19th century and the early 20th century However as of 2014 the lime kiln itself is in need of structural repair to strengthen the remains and has also been a victim of some minor vandalism In recent years the lime kiln was fenced off due to instability although by early 2014 this fencing had been pulled down most likely by vandals
Other limekilns
The Grove Lime kiln is one of a few remaining lime kilns on the island A 19th century lime kiln at Easton Lane within Easton village became Grade Listed II in November 1984 and lay in ruin for decades being exposed to weather and vandals By 2002 this lime kiln was turned into a residence and craft workshop Opposite this lime kiln is another which is larger and more complete At New Ground near the back of the Portland Heights Hotel another well-preserved lime kiln exists however by the 1990s it had become overgrown and remains in this state to date with no signs of the remains through the foliage Another lime kiln once stood nearby where the hotel now stands Finally at Avalanche Road within the Southwell village remains of another lime kiln to the east of the road is also covered with overgrowth

Umea Old Prison

History
Umea old prison was one of some 20 provincial prisons designed by Wilhelm Theodor Anckarsvard who was the architect of Fangvardsstyrelsen during the years 1855-1877
These prisons were built with the American Philadelphia system as a model which amongst other things meant that common cells were replaced by individual cells where prisoners would be able to contemplate their fate The prison housed a total of 24 cells on two floors which were located along the exterior walls so that everyone got daylight The prison building also housed offices and residential spaces The building was one of the few that survived the great fire of 1888 Also the southern wooden palisade survived the fire which give contemporary visitors an idea of the shape of the prison's exercise yard
The then-editor in chief of the local newspaper Vasterbottens-Kuriren Gustav Rosen 1876-1942 spent three months in prison in 1916 He was convicted of defamation of the city's Stadsfiskal the city's highest police official This was the culmination of the so-called Umea fights Umeabraken which attracted nation wide attention
The prison is now Umea's oldest surviving stone building and is one of the best preserved prisons in the country It was in use until 1981 when Umea prison was completed The prison is owned by the National Property Board of Sweden SFV and became a national monument in 1992
Theater
From 1987 and during most of the 1990s the building and the exercise yard was used by an amateur theater group Grotteatern and the independent theater group Profilteatern To the centenary of the devastating fire of 1888 Grotteatern in 1988 created a theater production called The Game of the Great Fire Spelet om den stora branden by Frank Kelber on the old prison's exercise yard Both Grotteatern and Profilteatern put up shows during the summers on the exercise yard for a number of years after that
Hotel
In 2007-2008 the building was converted into a hotel with 23 single rooms 2 family rooms and one double room with a conference room for meetings and celebrations that can accommodate up to 50 people It offers made beds with communal showers and toilets and socializing areas In the annex on the yard is the cafe Cafe Goteborg

Racine County Jane Doe

The Racine County Jane Doe informally known as Crystal Rae is an unidentified body of a young woman discovered in 1999 in the town of Raymond Racine County Wisconsin United States
Physical description
The malnourished woman may have been mentally disabled and had a cauliflower ear deformity which likely resulted from abuse It is believed that she was eighteen to thirty-years-old although some speculate she could have been in her mid-teens up to her mid thirties The teeth were not well cared for her front incisors protruded from the mouth and decay was present on many of her teeth some of which were missing The curly hair was observed to have been brown with blond highlights The eyes were either brown green or hazel the ears contained two earrings each As for clothing the victim wore a gray man's shirt with flower design on the front After contacting the manufacturer it was learned that the product was released in 1984 The body was also found wearing black sweatpants and no shoes
Discovery and investigation
The body of a white female was found near a field on July 21 1999 within a day after being disposed An autopsy indicated that she had died from multiple injuries such as burning and beating and had endured several weeks of neglect and abuse which had increased in the previous few days before she died Because it had rained the night the body was dumped little evidence of the perpetrators was found She was also apparently sexually abused It is believed that such a characteristic like the cauliflower ear deformity may have occurred due to the abusive conditions in which she lived One of the two who discovered the body stated that the arm appeared to be broken being in an unnatural position The remains were exhumed in 2013 for further study and transported to Milwaukee Wisconsin which had previously examined the body in 1999 Authorities hope that by studying the bones they would be able to tell where the woman had lived prior to her death
Multiple reconstructions were created to recreate the victim's face in efforts to solve the case In 2012 an additional reconstruction was created by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children Another version of the composite exists displaying a different facial expression The girl had previously been thought to be one particular runaway girl but DNA comparison demonstrated that they were not the same person Missing persons such as Tina D'Ambrosio Aundria Bowman and Karen Wells have since been ruled out
Other theories include the idea that she could have been an unreported missing person
Aftermath
Over fifty people attended the woman's funeral after the autopsy was completed She was buried in a grave reading Jane Doe which also stated the dates she was found and buried at the edge of Racine Wisconsin Although the murder remains unsolved investigators hope that the case will eventually come to a close A press conference in 2013 was reported to have uncovered more clues
Some believed that this case could be linked to the murder of Mary Kate Sunderlin a previously unidentified victim who was discovered in Lake County Illinois Sunderlin was also malnourished had poor dentition and had been beaten to death Three were arrested for Mary Sunderlin's murder one was convicted

Lindelbrunn Castle

Lindelbrunn Castle also called Lindelbol Lindelbronn or Lindelborn is the medieval ruin of a rock castle near the village of Vorderweidenthal in the county of Sudliche Weinstrase in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate
The name of the castle is probably derivied from the castle well which stands under a large lime tree German Linde
Geographical location
The ruions of Lindelbrunn lie about 2.3?km northeast of Vorderweidenthal on whose territory they stand and 1.7?km both as the crow flies south-southeast of Darstein It is located at a height of on the conical summit of the Schlosberg castle hill At its foot is a forester's lodge and a tourist cafe the Cramerhaus formerly belonging to the Palatine Forest Club
History
Lindelbrunn Castle was founded in the midlle of the 12th century presumably as an imperial castle to defend the Trifels Prior to that it may have been owned by the imperial church at Speyer In 1268 the ministerialis Dieter von Lindelbol is mentioned for the first time in the records as a descendant of the imperial seneschal Reichstruchses Markward von Annweiler ca 1140?1202 It is likely that the main construction phase of the castle with its palas and separate chapel dates to around 1190/1200 At that time large halls and independent chapels were only built by relatively high-ranking lords around 1200 not a single count had such a facilities In 1274 the castle was transferred by King Rudolph of Habsburg to Counts Emich IV and Frederick III of Leiningen In the course of time Lindelbrunn became a joint-inheritance or Ganerbenburg As a result of the enfeoffment of various parts of the castle there were so many co-owners that disputes arose In 1381 St Nicholas Chapel was first mentioned in a deed In 1441 troopps of the Palatine prince-elector and the Bishop of Speyer Reinhard von Helmstatt besieged the castle for seven weeks until a peaceful agreement ended the investment
Shortly after Easter 1450 as a result of a feud and the seizure of Hans von Helmstadt troops from the town of Landau and Bishopric of Speyer advanced on the castle After four days of unsuccessful siege Holzapfel was ransomed In June that year Count Emich VI of Leiningen-Hardenburg and his son Frederick of Zweibrucken-Bitsch besieged the castle captured it and so ended the disputes
During the German Peasants War of 1525 the castle was razed by rebellious peasants of the Kleeburg Kolbenhaufen band Since then it has remained unoccupied and fallen into ruins
In 1963 the castle became the possession of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate In 1979 to 1981 comprehensive remediation measures were carried out which saw the remains of the detached chapel being uncovered and partially restored

Because there are steep sandstone rock faces on all sides the castle did not need a neck ditch or a Zwinger The curtain walls of what is largely a stately home are also the castle walls and follow the lie of the terrain
Of the outer entrance to the castle nothing visible remains The surviving inner gate is in the northeast An older castle entrance south of it can be seen as a shaft that was hewn in the rock The foundations of the former St Nicholas Chapel around 1190/1200 have been restored
The most important visible remains are the preserved parts of the palas around 1190/1200 in the southwest of the castle The outer wall on the valley side is made of rusticated ashlars and has three niches with adjacent windows and fireplace that has not quite been faithfully reconstructed The interior probably contain a large hall
Although other outer walls and the remains of residential buildings have been partially reconstructed it is still difficult to get a clear picture of what the castle looked like At the highest point of the castle in the northeast Lindelbrunn could have had a bergfried but it has not yet been uncovered Also unclear is the original purpose of the building remains on an overhanging rock outcrop in the southwest as well as the discovery of a well south of the outer wall of the palas and thus outside the curtain wall Another well was located in the south of the castle near the chapel
Access and views
From the forester's lodge Forsthaus Lindelbrunn it is a 15 to 20 minute walk to the ruins of Lindelbrunn Castle In clear weather there is an extensive 360-degree panoramic view which also takes in the imperial castle of Trifels
Legends
Derivation of the name
When the knight who ruled the castle called his followers together in the courtyard to announce the name of the newly built castle an old gray-haired woman suddenly appeared and stood in the middle of his retinue While the knight and his entourage looked on amazed she planted a lime branch by the well She then said the knight that as long as the lime tree blossomed his family would also flourish and not wither She also said that the castle was henceforth to be called Lindelbrunn before disappearing The lime tree thrived and flourished and so did the knight's family he was popular throughout the land But Rothkopf the brother of the knight who had been outcast many years before met the old gray woman one day the forest She wanted the brothers to reconcile and took him to the castle But the knight at Lindelbrunn did not want to see his brother and the old gray woman in his castle and threatened that if they did not go away they would be hanged on the lime tree Then the old gray woman rose and stuck a distaff in the lime tree With a rustling of the leaves the lime tree fell down the well The old woman had broken off a small branch off before the lime tree disappeared She then left the castle with Rothkopf At the foot of the mountain she planted the branch and said to Rothkopf he should build a new castle at this spot using the stones of the old castle She disappeared and Rothkopf looked up to see the castle disintegrate in a violent storm and the stones roll down to him in the valley Rothkopf rushed back up the hill to save his brother but found only the ruins and no survivors Back in the valley he began to build a house with the stones of the castle as the old gray woman had told him to Today there are just ruins at the top of the hill and the forester's lodge is at its foot
How the castle was destroyed in the Peasants War
When the peasant mobs had made several attempts to burn the castle down and cause a bloodbath but failed because the castle was well defended by the knight and his foot soldiers the peasants withdrew with heavy losses and gave up The knight of the castle was celebrating his victory in fine style when a commoner stood before the gate in order to report the withdrawal of the peasants He was invited in and given a meal He praised the lord of the castle and wished him happiness Believing he was safe the knight allowed him to stay the night in the castle But when almost all those in the castle had fallen into a drunken sleep the commoner seized his chance He let down the drawbridge and the peasant mob which had been waiting outside the castle stormed in They caused a bloodbath stole what they could and burned the castle to the ground
Punker of Rohrbach
The squire Punker of Rohrbach once worked for the knight of the castle and served him well So one day he asked his master to make him a junker When the knight refused him contemptuously he left the castle and joined the army of the Count Palatine Louis the Bearded He was welcomed his skills as an archer were widely known Punker told the Count Palatine of several raids by the robber knight at the Lindelbrunn whereupon the Count Palatine sent his troops to the castle But the castle was well defended and the attack went nowhere Then Punker climbed a nearby rock which was higher than the castle and managed to fire an arrow into the heart of the robber baron of Lindelbrunn Punker continued to fire and hit all the defenders of the castle The troops of the Count Palatine were able to break down the gate but all their opponents in the castle were already dead or dying struck down by the Punker's arrows The Count Palatine could not believe what he saw suspected Punker of a lust for revenge guided by a magic hand and had imprisoned him for life in the tower Punker died within the damp walls and his lament is sung today even by the thrushes at Lindelbrunn
According to another legend the Count Palatine was suspicious of Punker and wanted to test his accuracy as an archer To do this Punker was asked to place a coin on the head of his son and shoot it off without injuring the boy Punker refused out of fear tha the devil could jog his hand and so his son would die But the Count Palatine insisted on the trial on pain of death Punker shot the coin from the head of his son without even grazing him and prepared another one even during the flight of the first The Count Palatine was pleased but he asked Punker why he had prepared the second arrow Punker replied that if his son had died the second arrow would have been for him the Count Palatine

While Gemma competed with Arthur for a the same position within the hospital she also competed with her friend Mary-Claire Carter Niamh McGrady for Harry Tressler's Jules Knight affections McGrady believed there would be some friction between Gemma and Mary-Claire but said they had a good working relationship Not long after arriving at Holby Gemma was involved in a hostage situation She and a female patient named Kelly Alexia Healy were confronted by Kelly's estranged husband Dean Delaney Dean Ashton who barricaded himself in a room with them Dean was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and was convinced the hospital was under attack Gemma found herself in a terrifying position and when Kelly's condition deteriorated Gemma had to act fast to save her

History of anthracite coal mining in Pennsylvania

There are two types of coal found in Pennsylvania anthracite Åghard coalÅh and bituminous Ågsoft coalÅh Anthracite coal is a natural mineral with a high carbon content that gives off energy and heat when burned making it useful as a fuel It was first used in Pennsylvania as a fuel in 1769 but because it is more difficult to ignite it was not used regularly until after the War of 1812 The developments of the canal and then railroad system made transporting the anthracite exponentially easier and by the 1860s anthracite coal was regularly supplying urban centers like Philadelphia and New York City and was helping to fuel the American Industrial Revolution
Geology
Anthracite and bituminous coal were formed in the eastern and western regions of Pennsylvania respectively during the Pennsylvanian time in the Carboniferous Geological Period ÅgHistory of Anthracite Coal MiningÅh The Pennsylvania Anthracite Region is in the Valley and Ridge Province of the Appalachian Mountains with the coal located in the folded and faulted terrain of the Province The anthracite fields are maintained in synclinal basins that are surrounded by sandstone ridges which help to ÅgprotectÅh the anthracite Hornberger et al 20-2 There are four different anthracite coalfields in Pennsylvania all located on the eastern side of the state The Northern field is located predominantly in the Luzerne Lackawanna Susquehanna and Wayne Counties the Western Middle field in Northumberland Columbia and Schuylkill Counties Eastern Middle field mainly in Luzerne County but extending into Schuylkill Carbon and Columbia Counties the Southern field in Carbon Schuylkill Lebanon and Dauphin Counties Latzko 8 Anthracite differs from bituminous in usage in that it has better heat quality and fewer disadvantageous by-products but it has higher carbon content and is therefore harder to ignite and requires a grate to separate the ashes from the burning coal Day 371
Early Detection of Coal
One of the earliest mentions that coal might be found in the Pennsylvania area dates back to 1698 when Gabriel Thomas wrote an account dedicated to William Penn He notes the possibility of coal because the running water had the same coloring as the water in the coalmines in Wales Hoffman 353 The actual presence of coal is first recorded on a map made in 1753 by John Pattin an Indian trader although it is possible he did not detect the coal first hand but rather heard about it from other traders Edmunds 1 Soon after in 1754 George Washington led an expedition across the Allegheny Mountains and his second-in-command wrote a letter detailing an abundance of natural luxuries including coal in the western region of Pennsylvania Hoffman 353 Then in 1761 the first actual Pennsylvania coalmine is recorded on the ÅgPlan of Fort Pitts and Parts AdjacentÅh map The bituminous mine was located in Fort Pitt near the top of Coal Hill which is now downtown Pittsburgh Edmunds 2 Anthracite coal was first found in 1762 and then was used for the first time around 1769 by Obadiah Gore and his brother in their blacksmith shop in Wilkes-Barre However coal usage was generally restricted to local consumption need until the industry began to expand at the turn of the 19th century Latzko 3
Early History of Coal Mining
The Lehigh Coal Mine Company first used coal commercially in 1792 The company was founded after German immigrant Philip Ginder discovered beds of the anthracite Ågstone coalÅh near Summit Hill in 1791 while out hunting Carr A wealthy landowner named Jacob Weiss provided the capital to form the Lehigh Coal Mine Company with other businessmen from Philadelphia The company had a slow start because of the difficulty in igniting anthracite coal and the inability to transfer the coal to urban markets Dublin Licht 11 Judge Jesse Fell of Wilkes-Barre discovered a solution to ignite anthracite in 1808 with the usage of an iron grate that allowed the coal to light and burn easier Demand for the anthracite coal increased slightly Dublin Licht 12 Brothers Abijah and John Smith were the first to successfully transport hard coal when they moved 50 tons on an ark down the Susquehanna River to Columbia in 1807 Latzko 3
War of 1812
In 1810 350 tons of anthracite was mined in Pennsylvania The use of anthracite coal was restricted due to the difficulties in transporting it efficiently and the industry was still small and undeveloped Latzko 3 The War of 1812 against Great Britain increased the usage of anthracite coal Prior to the war citizens of the nationÅfs urban centers such as New York and Philadelphia received most of their coal fuel needs from Britain and VirginiaÅfs bituminous coal supplies Dublin Licht 12 During the war the British blockade of American ports severely limited the supply of British bituminous fuel reaching the US and there was also a shortage in VirginiaÅfs supply resulting in a fuel crisis Adams ÅgWarming the Poor,Åh 76 Before the war citizens did not like to use anthracite coal because it was difficult to ignite and maintain but the wartime shortage forced them to start using anthracite Jacob Cist of Wilkes-Barre promoted the use of anthracite during and after the War of 1812 Jacob CistÅfs father was a major investor in the Lehigh Coal Mine Company so Cist began to transport the companyÅfs coal to Philadelphia by the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers Dublin Licht 12 Once in Philadelphia he used testimonials and public demonstrations to negate the stereotype of anthracite and convince Philadelphia society that the hard coal could be used as a replacement for bituminous coal Adams ÅgWarming the Poor,Åh 81 Cist and other advocates including the Pennsylvania state legislature and government officials continued to promote the anthracite and the War of 1812 was able to open the way for Pennsylvania anthracite coal to outdo VirginiaÅfs bituminousÅf share of the market Day 371
Canals
With the opening of the major canals Lehigh Schuylkill and Delaware & Hudson in addition to smaller ones such as the Delaware Division and Morris Canals canal companies successfully provided urban markets for anthracite coal Latzko 3 The anthracite commercial market greatly expanded and the hard coal was used as valuable fuel for heating and cooking domestically as well as energy sources for small businesses such as blacksmiths brewers bakers and manufacturers Adams ÅgUS Coal IndustryÅh
Lehigh Canal
Joseph White and Erskine Hazard founded the Lehigh Navigation Company in 1818 They wanted to use rivers to more efficiently transport anthracite coal After they were declined a charter to the Schuylkill River they tried to receive a charter for the Lehigh River The Lehigh River was located near the Summit Hill Mine which was mined and operated by the Lehigh Coal Mine Company Joseph White and Erskine Hazard made a partnership between their company and the Lehigh Coal Mine Company to form the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company which was incorporated in 1822 They received a charter from the Pennsylvania legislature giving them the right to improve navigation on the Lehigh River which effectively granted them a monopoly over the Lehigh White and Hazard ordered the construction of a roadway to link the Summit Hill Mine and the Lehigh River and then ordered the building of a canal By 1840 over 250,000 tons of anthracite mined from the region annually reached Philadelphia through White and HazardÅfs Lehigh River system Dublin Licht 12-3

A group of Germans wanted to seek the rights to the Schuylkill River They received a charter in 1815 to incorporate the Schuylkill Navigation Company which would have control over the Schuylkill River After receiving investors the Schuylkill Navigation Company was able to finance a 108-mile long river and canal system that connected the Pottsville area to Philadelphia that opened in 1825 By the early 1840s some 500,000 tons of anthracite coal was being transported annually to Philadelphia using the Schuylkill River Dublin Licht 13
Delaware & Hudson Canal
The Wurts brothers William and Maurice owned coalfields in the northeastern Pennsylvania anthracite region but found an unresponsive market in Philadelphia which was receiving coal from the Schuylkill and Lehigh routes They saw business potential in finding a connection route between anthracite fields and the New York City market and so they had the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company incorporated in 1823 Sciaky 275-6 The D&H Company built a canal system across parts of the Delaware and Hudson Rivers that stretched from Honesdale PA to Rondout NY which was completed in 1828 ÅgDelaware and HudsonÅh
The Railway
The rise of the railway system expanded the anthracite coal industry The D&H Company was one of the first to attempt the use of steam locomotives in America They purchased a locomotive from England so they could transport coal from the mines to their canal and tested it on a railroad track in 1829 The locomotive ultimately failed as it was too heavy for the wooden track but demand was sparked for lighter locomotives that could transport coal from the mines to the canals ÅgDelaware and HudsonÅh Locomotives that solely transported coal from mines to canal entries were in use in the 1830s but goals were set to use railroads to bypass canals all together In 1855 Asa Parker opened the Lehigh Valley Railroad LVRR to compete with the Lehigh Coal & Navigation CompanyÅfs monopoly The LVRR would eventually link the Mauch Chunk area of Pennsylvania all the way through New Jersey to NYC The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad was opened in 1839 connecting Reading PA in the southern anthracite region to Philadelphia Through acquisitions it eventually went north to the Schuylkill field and east towards the Lehigh region It faced competition with the Schuylkill Navigation Company until the Reading Railroad eventually leased out the Schuylkill Navigation Company in 1870 The Delaware Lackawanna & Western Railroad would become the major carrier of anthracite from the northern fields to NYC Dublin Licht 15-17 While the extensive railroad systems made transporting more efficient they also lowered the price of coal in distant markets such as Philadelphia and NYC relative to the prices in areas surrounding the mines In 1840 the wholesale price of anthracite in Philadelphia relative to the mine price was 3.6 and by 1864 the ratio was 1.3
The Iron Industry
The usage of anthracite coal in the iron industry increased demand for hard coal Since the late 18th century coke bituminous coal with the impurities burned away was used as fuel to make iron in Britain With the spread of popularity of anthracite in the early 19th century iron makers began experimenting with using anthracite as fuel in iron production It wasnÅft until 1840 when David Thomas introduced Welsh hot blast technology to the Lehigh Crane Iron Company that anthracite was successfully used to smelt iron It was indicated that using anthracite saved up to 25% in the production of iron and that the quality of the iron was also superior Adams ÅgUS Coal IndustryÅh By the 1850s anthracite was used in the manufacture of about half of all crude iron produced in the US The increased efficiency of anthracite heat was also instrumental in the manufacture of metal machinery and the transformation of water into steam for machinery power Dublin Licht 17
Civil War Period
The Civil War created a shift in the makeup of the anthracite coal industry Prior to the war the industry involved many small-scale mines with short-term leases resulting in increasing production levels but an overall trend of falling prices In 1830 anthracite coal was selling for $11 per ton in 1840 it was $7 per ton and by 1860 it was $5.50 a ton in NYC while total production was increasing Adams ÅgUS Coal IndustryÅh This was due in part to a general anti-charter sentiment towards the coal industry by the Pennsylvania state government making it difficult for coal corporations to receive charters Adams ÅgDifferent ChartersÅh as well as a seasonal market that experienced fluctuation in demand for anthracite Dublin Licht 17 The onset of the war brought an increased need for fuel for the army and in turn an expected increase in demand for coal The boom of investment in the coal industry and predicted large-scale production of anthracite coal shifted the mentality of the Pennsylvania state government and the legislature dramatically increased the number and quality of charters it granted to mining companies Adams ÅgDifferent ChartersÅh Individual proprietors fell to the expansion of corporations who could master the large-scale production and efficient transportation that the wartime economy called for The major railroad companies came to dominate the industry as they began to purchase coalfields in order to control both the production and shipping aspects With increased concentration of capital among the smaller number of operations they were able to create deeper and deeper mining shafts to reach new levels of coal Dublin Licht 18-9 By the end of the 19th century the Pennsylvania anthracite industry was controlled by a handful of major railroad corporations

Islamic extremism in Northern Nigeria

Islamic extremism is adherence to a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam see Islamic fundamentalism potentially including the promotion of violence to achieve political goals see Jihadism In contemporary times Islamic extremism in Northern Nigeria is typified by the Boko Haram insurgency and the proselytizing campaigns of Wahabbist groups like Izala
History
The first recorded Jihad in what is now Northern Nigeria was waged in the 14th century by the then Sultan of Kano Ali Yaji it culminated in the Battle of Santolo and the subsequent transformation of the Habe- Hausa Kingdoms of Northern Nigeria into Islamic Sultanates In the 19th Century the Fula people led by Usman dan Fodio overthrew many of these Sultanates in another Jihad campaign and replaced them with an even more puritanical religious Caliphate however the slow rise of Islamic mysticism in the form of Sufi Brotherhoods under the Caliphate reversed some of the more puritanical tendencies of the early caliphate
After the pacification of Northern Nigeria by the British they preserved most of the native institutions of the Sokoto Caliphate including its Emirates which were heavily aligned with the Sufi Orders In the 1960s however the former Grand Qadi of Northern Nigeria Abubakar Gumi and Sheikh Ismaila Idris with support of wahabbist organisations from Saudi Arabia established the Jamatul Izalatul Bidia Wa Ikhamatul Sunnah
Infused with further religious zeal from the Arab Sahwa Izala quickly became the offshoot of numerous other fundamentalist groups like Boko Haram and Ansaru
Kala Kato
Unlike most contemporary Islamist organizations the Kala Kato are a Quranist movement that sprang up as a counter reaction to the Wahabist influence of Izala in Northern Nigeria In the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis and the Iranian Revolution Islamist organizations re-exploring the avenues of Islamic Ijtihad in jurisprudence sparked a counter reaction from the students of Sufi Zawiyyas Whereas these groups used numerous Hadith's and texts external to the Quran to justify their stance the Kala Kato decided to reject them and proclaimed the sole authority of the Quran as a source of religious law
In the 1980s KalaKato turned militant and Muhammadu Marwa led a faction of the movement in a brutal uprising in many parts of the region
Izala
Izala officially named Jamatul Izalatul Bidia Wa Ikhamatul Sunnah is the first Islamist organization in modern times to openly advocate for a militant transformation of Northern Nigerian institutions in line with fundamentalist interpretations of Islam Officially founded in 1978 with funding from Saudi Arabia it is like most Wahabbist organizations split between the more Militant Ikhwanist-Qutbist view of radical Jihad and the more political Maududist view of promotional Jihad
The Ikhwanist find inspiration from the teachings of the early Wahabist Ikhwan Movement and Sayyid Qutb who justified the violent overthrow of systems deemed unIslamic In 2001 a faction of the Ikhwanist broke away to form Boko Haram
The Maududist faction find inspiration from the teachings of the movements founder Abubakar Gumi and Abul A'la Maududi and essentially advocate for a smart political jihad that they believe will mitigate any loss of life on their part

Global Address Space Programming Interface

Global Address Space Programming Interface GPI is an API for the development of scalable asynchronous and fault tolerant parallel applications It is an implementation of the partitioned global address space programming model
History
GPI is developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics ITWM since 2005 and was initially known as FVM Fraunhofer Virtual Machine
In 2009 the name changed to Global Address Programming Interface or GPI
In 2011 Fraunhofer ITWM and its partners such as Fraunhofer SCAI TUD T-Systems SfR DLR KIT FZJ DWD and Scapos have initiated and launched the GASPI project to define a novel specification for an API GASPI based on GPI and to make this novel specification a reliable scalable and universal tool for the HPC community GPI-2 is the first open source implementation of this standard
The software is freely available to application developers and researchers licenses for commercial use are available through Scapos AG
GPI has completely replaced MPI at Fraunhofer ITWM where all products and research are based on the new GPI-2
Concepts
Segments
Modern hardware typically involves a hierarchy of memory with respect to the bandwidth and latency of read and write accesses Within that hierarchy are non-uniform memory access NUMA partitions solid state devices SSDs graphical processing unit GPU memory or many integrated cores MIC memory The memory segments are supposed to map this variety of hardware layers to the software layer In the spirit of the PGAS approach these GPI segments may be globally accessible from every thread of every GPI process GPI segments can also be used to leverage different memory models within a single application or to even run different applications
Groups
A group is a subset of all ranks The group members have common collective operations A collective operation on a group is then restricted to the ranks forming that group There is a initial group GASPI_GROUP_ALL from which all ranks are members
Forming a group involves 3 steps creation addition and a commit These operations must be performed by all ranks forming the group The creation is performed using codice_1 If this operation is successful ranks can be added to the created group using codice_2
To be able to use the created group all ranks added to it must commit to the group This is performed using codice_3 a collective operation between the ranks in the group
One-sided communication
One-sided asynchronous communication is the basic communication mechanism provided by GPI-2 The one-sided communication comes in two flavors There are read and write operations single or in a list from and into allocated segments Moreover the write operations are extended with notifications to enable remote completion events which a remote rank can react on One-sided operations are non-blocking and asynchronous allowing the program to continue its execution along with the data transfer
The mechanisms for communication in GPI-2 are the following
codice_4
Queues
There is the possibility to use different queues for communication requests where each request can be submitted to one of the queues These queues allow more scalability and can be used as channels for different types of requests where similar types of requests are queued and then get synchronised together but independently from the other ones separation of concerns
Global atomics
GPI-2 provides atomic operations such that variables can be manipulated atomically There are two basic atomic operations codice_5 and codice_6 The values can be used as global shared variables and to synchronise processes or events
Timeouts
Failure tolerant parallel programs require non-blocking communication calls GPI-2 provides a timeout mechanism for all potentially blocking procedures Timeouts for procedures are specified in milliseconds For instance GASPI_BLOCK is a pre-defined timeout value which blocks the procedure call until completion GASPI_TEST is another predefined timeout value which blocks the procedure for the shortest time possible i e the time in which the procedure call processes an atomic portion of its work

Tomie Arai

Tomie Arai is an Asian American artist and community activist who was born raised and is still active in New York City
Biography
Artist and community activist Tomie Arai was born in New York City in 1949 A third generation Japanese American her parents are from Hawaii and California and her grandparents were farmers who settled in the country in the early 1900s Her experiences growing up Asian American in New York City deeply color her work as an artist as many of her works deal with the urban experience and attempt to make connections to her family and community through art
At the time she began to pursue a career in art in the late 1960s and early 1970s her feeling that the New York art world failed to address her experiences as an Asian American and woman of color propelled her to become involved in community art She joined the Basement Workshop in 1972 and there learned about Asian American activism and making art along with other Asian American artists Between 1972 and 1979 Arai worked at Cityarts Workshop as a resource center coordinator and mural director painting a series of community murals in New York CityÅfs Lower East Side CityartsÅf first project in Chinatown A History of Chinese Immigration to the U.S involved many Basement Workshop members After Cityarts Arai worked as a freelance graphic artist for Alan Okada of Citibank At the time Arai created posters brochures and promotional materials for community groups as part of CitibankÅfs Graphic Support program In the 1980s Arai began to focus on printmaking As a Board Member of the Lower East Side Printshop and a keyholder for over 15 years Arai also participated in print residencies at the WomenÅfs Studio Workshop the Printmaking Workshop Self Help Graphics and the Brandywine Workshop in Philadelphia These non-profit workspaces encouraged artists to collaborate and experiment with the printed image
As an artist Arai has been an avid proponent of making art in spaces outside of the hierarchical gallery system and the need to redefine art and its relation to community Instead of the historical paradigm of public art as a monumental sculpture placed in a site with no connection to the community she advocates community-based art created through a dialogic process between artist and community members whose end goal is creating art with which the community feels ownership She stresses that artists need to build relationships with organizations and communities She has created community-based works such as ÅgSwirlÅh a public sculpture in Philadelphia that helps bring to the fore the less visible history of Chinese Americans in the nationÅfs foundersÅf city and a variety of other works commissioned by the Arizona Humanities Council the Cambridge Arts Council the Bronx Museum of the Arts the National Endowment for the Arts and the Museum of Chinese in America
In addition Arai has created site specific public works of art commissioned by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs Percent for Art Program the General Services Administration of the Federal Government the NYC MTA Arts for Transit Program and the San Francisco Arts Commission that deal with community themes

Whale watching in New Zealand

Whale watching in New Zealand is closely associated with the town of Kaikoura Known as the whale capital it is a world-famous whale watching site in particular for sperm whales Whale watching is also offered in other locations often as eco-tours and in conjunction with dolphin watching Land-based whale watching from New Zealand's last whaling station which closed in 1964 is undertaken for scientific purposes mostly by ex-whalers Some compilations of sighting footages are available on YouTube
Background
Many places that were formerly whaling stations went into recession after the collapse of the whaling industry New Zealand stopped whaling in 1964 Whaling did not stop due to environmental or ethical concerns but because the declining number of whales made the industry uneconomic Whilst New Zealand protected right whales in 1935 it was not until 1978 that all marine mammals were protected by law Kaikoura's recent development has been used to advocate the benefits of whale watching over whale hunting Due to illegal whaling by Soviet Union with help of Japan in the 1970s recovery state of baleen whales migrating to New Zealand coasts were heavily slowed down far worse than in Australian waters and this contributed to make public images that Kaikoura is the only site for whale watching and Sperm Whale is the only species can be observed normally New Zealand is the first nation in the world to protect marine mammals by law
Hauraki Gulf
Waters in Hauraki Gulf and Bay of Islands are home to several species of cetaceans most notably for Orca the Killer whales and Bryde's whale the only baleen whale species of residential in the nation However this local stock is critically endangered numbering of around 50 individuals left Little Barrier Island is a migratory collider and resting/calving ground for baleen whales
Kaikoura
The sea around Kaikoura supports an abundance of sea life with the town's income stemming largely from the tourism generated from whale watching and swimming with or around dolphins Recently the sperm whale watching at Kaikoura has developed rapidly and now it is an industry leader arguably the most developed in the world
The dominant organisation in Kaikoura's whale watching industry is Whale Watch Kaikoura which is run as a charitable organisation It takes around 100,000 visitors out by boat per annum and has an annual turnover of NZ$10m Whale Watch Kaikoura began operating in 1987 with a boat Whale watching is also done by air and the Kaikoura Aerodrome is mainly used for whale spotting tourist flights by Wings over Whales and Air Kaikoura - Kaikoura Aero Club
Tory Channel
New Zealand's last whaling station was in Whekenui Bay in Tory Channel in the Marlborough Sounds The high cliffs at the entrance of Tory Channel are ideal for land-based whale watching During the migratory season for whales the lookout is manned and whales passing Cook Strait are watched for research purposes Most of the volunteers undertaking the work are ex-whalers It is also the location where the first Southern right whale on main islands sighted since the end of whaling Cetaceans can be seen in Waikawa Picton French Pass and in Abel Tasman National Park as well
Other locations
Whale watching in conjunction with dolphin watching is already offered in the Bay of Islands and Moutohora Island also known as Whale Island in the Bay of Plenty
Future developments
Other locations or anywhere else in the nation such as at bays on Aupouri Peninsula Rangaunu Harbour Whangarei Harbour Firth of Thames Tamaki Bight eastern Coromandel Peninsula Mount Maunganui Hawke's Bay Castlepoint vicinity to Wellington South Taranaki Bight New Plymouth Kapiti Island Golden Bay Hokitika Banks Peninsula Moeraki and Karitane Otago Peninsula Taieri Mouth Nugget Point The Catlins Port Craig in Te Waewae Bay Fiordland Paterson Inlet Chatham and Kermadec Islands may possibly become watching locations in the future when numbers of whales migrating into coastal waters show recovery Sighting numbers of Southern rights Humpbacks Blues are showing strong increases in recent years
Southern right whales Tohora the most important whale to New Zealand is very slowly but steadily making come backs to the nation's waters and they will possibly become one of the most important species for whale watching as well since they are renowned as a target for non-harmful land-based watching and will recolonize the shores of the entire New Zealand to become seasonal residents see also Whale Rider and real whale riders sometimes appear for this species For Southern blue and Pygmy blues even before the historic discovery of a forging ground off Cape Egmont whales have been showing come backs along the coasts especially in Northland waters such as off Bay of Islands Tutukaka and Kaikoura Fin whales and Sei whales are confirmed in Chatham Rise in good numbers but less frequently seen in coastal waters Minke whales can be seen off entire nation especially in Bay of Islands but due to their small size it is not easy to observe them Beaked whales are occasionally seen Of these most frequently observed species are Arnoux's beaked whales once a group of these had become a regular annual to Doubtful Sound and Gray's beaked whales New Zealand's coasts are also renowned as prominent habitats for curious ray-hunting Orcas


Kuskulana River

Kuskulana River is a waterway in the U.S state of Alaska It is located in the Wrangell?St Elias National Park and Preserve
Geography
The stream has its source in Kuskulana Glacier at an elevation of about 2,200?feet It flows southwestward for about 21?miles and joins Chitina River about 10?miles above the Copper at an elevation of approximately 600?feet thus having an average grade of a little over 75?feet per mile The main body of Kuskulana Glacier is about 11?miles long and slopes from east to west with an average width of about one-third mile It receives four northern branches that emanate from the south and west slopes of Mount Blackburn The basin above the Chitina Valley is exceedingly rugged The snowfall in the higher mountains is said to be heavy accumulating in massive drifts in the gulches and sheltered spots and in some places lasting throughout the summer The river derives its main supply from Kuskulana Glacier and is heavily laden with glacial silt and sand
In the upper 10?miles of its course the river passes through a broad gravel-filled flat with high mountains on either side its lower course of 11?miles across the Chitina Valley lies for much of the way through a steep rock-walled canyon At the railroad crossing the rails are about 220?feet above the water surface and the canyon within rock walls is about 170?feet deep The width at the water surface about 200?feet below the bridge measured 70?feet and the width at the top was estimated to be about 150?feet The canyon affords many excellent dam sites Below Strelna Creek it is in many places particularly narrow and its walls are nearly vertical The river is said to get very low in the winter and goes dry at places in the upper basin above the canyon where the underlying formation is composed of loose material There is no opportunity for large storage in the basin but the river offers opportunity for the development of a thousand horsepower or more for five or six months during the year by the construction of a dam at the canyon but the winter flow is undoubtedly too low to warrant the operation of such a plant even though ice difficulties could be overcome

The tributary streams above the canyon are all small Nugget Creek which is the largest enters the main stream from the west just below the glacier It drains an area of 12.1?square miles and falls about 800?feet in the lower 2?miles Several other minor streams in the upper basin have heavy grades Strelna Creek the most important tributary of the Kuskulana heads in the ridge south of the Kotsina River at an elevation of 6,000 to 7,000?feet and enters the Kuskulana between 4 and 5?miles from the Chitina It is about 12?miles long The lower 6?miles of its course he across the Chitina Valley plateau with a grade of about 200?feet per mile There are no glaciers in its basin and the summer flow depends on rainfall and melting snow in the headwaters Some winters it is said to go dry in others there is a small flow even during the coldest weather

CFPB Rural Designation Petition and Correction Act

The CFPB Rural Designation Petition and Correction Act is a bill that would amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to direct the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB to establish an application process that would allow a person to get their county designated as rural for purposes of a federal consumer financial law One practical effect of having a county designated rural is that people can qualify for some types of mortgages by getting them exempted from the CFPB's qualified mortgage rule
The bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress
Background
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector Its jurisdiction includes banks credit unions securities firms payday lenders mortgage-servicing operations foreclosure relief services debt collectors and other financial companies operating in the United States
The CFPB's creation was authorized by the Dodd?Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act whose passage in 2010 was a legislative response to the financial crisis of 2007?08 and the subsequent Great Recession
Provisions of the bill
This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service a public domain source
The CFPB Rural Designation Petition and Correction Act would amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to direct the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB to establish an application process under which a person who lives or does business in a state may apply to have a county designated as a rural area for purposes of a federal consumer financial law
The bill would prescribe criteria for the CFPB to consider when evaluating such an application
The bill would require the CFPB to enter each such application into a sortable downloadable database publicly accessible through its website
Procedural history
The CFPB Rural Designation Petition and Correction Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 11 2013 by Rep Garland Andy Barr R KY-6 The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Financial Services and the United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit The bill was scheduled to be voted on under suspension of the rules on May 6 2014
Debate and discussion
The National Association of Federal Credit Unions NAFCU supported the bill arguing that the bill would be helpful to small creditors including credit unions offering mortgages with balloon-payment features in underserved areas because it would allow them to satisfy the ruleÅfs ability to repay requirements The NAFCU thought that the application process described by this bill would make the process for obtaining a rural designation fairer and more transparent
The Conference of State Bank Supervisors CSBS wrote a letter in support of the bill arguing that certain aspects of lending should not be regulated with a nationwide broad brush approach and must necessarily provide for local flexibility According to the CSBS the current method of designating a county as rural is formulaic and is inflexible when applied to counties with atypical population distributions or geographic boundaries thus necessitating a more nuanced approach


Media and gender

Media and gender refers to the influence of media on gender identification The media creates representations that give a particular picture or model of someone or something With mass media such as radio movies internet television those representations become tangible references in society and this can influence people's gender identity
Media and gender in the 20th century
Representations of genders
Betty Friedan American feminist and writer analysed American women's journals such as Ladies Home Journal McCallÅfs Good Housekeeping and Woman's Home Companion in her book The Feminine Mystique published in 1963 She discussed the role of women in the American society of the post-Second World War Firstly she noticed that in 1939 media spread the idea of a modern woman happy and willing to get the right to build her own life In those stories heroines are women with a professional life who are determined and independent But after the Second World War media broadcast a new propaganda that a housewifeÅfs lifestyle is the only proper way for women to reach happiness Femininity is associated with the concepts of maternity and housekeeping
Betty Friedan also underlines the overlap of media representations with social relations between sexes It produces the paradigm of masculinityÅfs superiority over women
Feminists against media representations of genders
In the 1960s and 1970s feminists such as Clare Short Gaye Tuchman Angela McRobbie denounced the unfair representations of gender in media and especially in magazines
Germaine Greer wrote that women are perceived as mere consumers who benefit from the purchasing power of their husband They become targets for marketing and their image is used to sell products in advertisement In 1978 Gaye Tuchman invented the concept of the symbolic annihilation She blamed media for imposing a negative vision of active women and making an apologia of housewives She feared that stereotypes would discourage young women viewers from having professional ambitions which are essential for the American economy
From media representations feminists paved the way for debates and discussions about gender within the social and political spheres In 1980 the British deputy Clare Short proposed a bill to banish shirtless women from press tabloid
Gender identity built through stereotypes in media
Why the media uses stereotypes
The media is a profitable enterprise which aims to attract the greatest number of audiences in order to make a profit Producing universally mainstream media create a possible association between an audience and social life People watch what they feel concerned about Thus stereotypes are significantly used in mass media because they are subjective pictures of oneÅfs life and sensitize an audience
Types of stereotypes in mass media
Mass media provide a dual picture of sex Stereotypes are recurrent in every main media television radio magazines newspaper In its final report on the assimilation of sexistsÅf stereotypes by youths the French government describes three types of cliches
Firstly the report points out the systematic behaviour dedicated to women and to men In cartoons for instance women are usually fond of shopping and always look at themselves in the mirror Cartoons display an irresistible and inaccessible representation of femininity especially for young girls Almost like small adults with big muscles and generous breast characters already determine gender at a very early age The American cartoon The Simpsons is a case in point but also the Japanese one Dragon BallZ or also a Franco-Canadian cartoon Totally Spies
Secondly the report stresses the way men and women are qualified in media In TV shows for instance even though equality of sex is more and more integrated they notice that the boss is usually a man Furthermore secondary characters often have discriminated status
Finally the report observes that the shooting techniques reflects a biased vision of gender due to redundant camera shots emotiveness parentsÅf parts seductionÅc Woman is fetishized in mass media Her body is highlighted her face her silhouette her thinness her breast and her legs too There is a clear purpose to emphasize on her sexuality and attractivness On the contrary men have diverse representations in video programs The only commune characteristic the report has noted is the musculature
In radio and advertisement women are targeted for cosmetics products and housekeeping They receive a vocabulary evoking beauty and are usually judged on physical criteria for instance the age Conversely scientific topics are attributed to men Adjectives used to qualified men are usually turned to foolishness and humour
Consequences of stereotypes on gender identification
Stereotypes influence the way we perceive femininity and masculinity On the one hand media depict a young girl tender and sexy helping her mum in the kitchen on the other hand a cute boy playing in the garden with his dad Those references are appreciated and valued by teenagers during the construction of their sexual identity
The magazine Psychology Today made a survey and observed that ÅgOf 3,452 women who responded to this survey 23% indicated that movie or television celebrities influenced their body image when they were young and 22% endorsed the influence of fashion magazine modelsÅh
As Malgorzata Wolska wrote in her article ÅgGender stereotypes in mass mediaÅh in 2011 the media creates messages that create opinion And since ÅgWhat does not exist in the media does not exist in the public mindÅh according to Castells Manuel stereotypes used by media become real through peopleÅfs construction of reality Because we see listen and watch stereotypes on genders we know them and unconsciously we reproduce them in real life
Fighting stereotypes toward a new identity
Greater representation of woman
A survey conducted by Dr Smith shows that only 7% of women are directors 13% are writers and 20% are producers in films However an increasing number of women work in media field as journalist or director Therefore they deal with topic tightly related to women needs and tend to provide a positive role for women No longer only consumers of media but also contributors of media they get more involved in decision-making and agenda of activities This empowerment of women gives them abilities to promote balance in gender representations and avoid stereotypes Media become a suitable ground for expressions and claims
Normalization of taboo
Furthermore Virginie Julliard and Nelly Quemener remark that even though the dominant conception in media is heterosexuality and construction of femininity and masculinity diverse versions are used in media which can also be a source of identification by the audience
Controversy
On the contrary Bruno Perreau professor at the MIT and researcher at Cambridge and Harvard Universities thinks that media cannot influence gender Indeed the gender theory does make sense only for people who think that sex and sexuality can be determined by speech He assumes that talking about homosexuality does not make anyone becoming a homosexual Therefore the concept of gender should be taught at school because media does not influence our sexual identity


Central Warwickshire Youth Football League

The Central Warwickshire Youth Football League or also known as Central Warwickshire League abbreviated to C.W.Y.F.L are a minor / youth League who are affiliated members of the Birmingham County Football Association
The Central Warwickshire League hosts a number of football clubs from Under 7's to Under 18's who are formed within the County of Warwickshire The league is also recognized under the Warwickshire County Football Affiliation
History
The Central Warwickshire League was founded back in 1969 by the Founder Members Ken Brownhill Wally Hedgley and Paul Hyde With the league originally consisting of nine football clubs Claverdon Balsall Hornets Hockley Heath Earlswood Widney Athletic Barston Bearley United,Chadwick End and Rowington
The Central Warwickshire set-up over the years has became more efficient which is a complete contrast to the early days when the meeting room peopled by local football managers was a symbol of parochial worthiness and a centre for exchange of opinions reactionary and otherwise towards the formation of a Boy's league
The Senior representative record was indeed enviable as they only lost one game in the season and that set-back was in the 1969-70 season It was Ken Brownhill who refused to be swayed from his selection of players and thereby providing followers of the league with an era of big match workmanlike soccer produced with collective zeal and determination and numerous glimpses of individual talent of a high order
Divisional cup competitions were introduced as well as Supplementary Medals competitions to ensure interest throughout seasons and the annual Solihull News Cup Final which was played at Damson Lane Elmdon through the generosity of Birmingham City F.C always attracts big crowds
The introduction of better teams into the Friendly Warwickshire league forced officials was to become more efficient Affiliation with the Birmingham County Football Association and the enlistment of Mr Rich Jones in 1971 to join the original league committee of Ken Brownhill Wally Hedgley and Paul Hyde meant that with the aforementioned individual acting as custodian of the hotherto experimental Nursery League a much closer unison between members became more evident as rules were formed and enforced
Efficiency became a priority as the league became stronger Resentment simmered below the surface when rural teams struggled to match the skills of more polished outsiders But the newcomers provided the spur to urge the Sunday get-together teams into an eventual motivated opposition
Widney Athletic and Bearley United were recruited to the ranks and standards improved Shirley Saturn were another powerful side but the meteoric rise of Astwood Bank and Elmdon Colts in recent years was not predictable The conjunction of men and players with undeniable talent was far from fortuitous The precedents established by these teams challenged complacency and by stimulating envy encouraged a revision of attitudes elsewhere Hence the general improvement of standards throughout the C.W.Y.& B.L Central Warwickshire Youth and Boys League as clubs sought to beat the unbeatables
Mr.Colin Moscrop became a member of the committee in 1974 who was in charge of the referees for Nursery and Minor matches with his experience this paved the way for his new post as Match and Referees Secretary for all three sections this campaign
The 1974-75 Season saw the introduction of the Minor League with the League growing to 31 teams Mr Brian Holtom made an excellent secretary of this division and the clubs concerned co-operated one hundred per-cent to provide a smoothly run and incident free season Woodbank boys proved worthy champions & set a very high standard The league also had an Under 16s representative side who managed to get victories against the Stratford-upon-Avon League and Notts Elizabethen League whilst drawing 4-4 against the Birmingham Boys League
1978 saw the start of the Gordon Beard era and the famous Olton Ravens Gordon went on to join the league committee in 1983 as a league secretary As league secretary Gordon immediately set about the expansion of the league In his first season there were 83 teams that formed the Central Warwickshire League By the 1988-89 season there were 183 teams an increase of 100teams within 10 years a figure Gordon was proud and eager to boast about
Within Olton Ravens Gordon was known affectionately to all as The Gaffer He was an inspiration to many A man of compassion Where his lads were concerned he disciplined the unruly he protected and gave strength to the weak and comforted the lonely He had a strict code of ethics within the club but had a heart of gold Many former Ravens will tell you of the annual trips to the Isle of Wight that they looked forward to and trips to Wales and Jersey all paid for by Gordon He ensured his Olton Ravens were ambassadors of junior football wherever they went
Sadly Gordon died in 1988 but left behind him a club that now graces the Central Warwickshire League A respected club with enormous tradition A club where its players are proud to wear the gold and black stripes
2007 saw Wally Hedgley take up the President role within the league The league saw the first Under 18's division formed in the 2008-09 season with Kings Norton winning the Premier Division One year later saw the introduction of the Presidents Cup for the Under 18's again Kings Norton dominating the age group by winning both the League and Cup competition
By the 2009-10 season the Central Warwickshire Youth League had approximately 167 football clubs with over 600 teams which were made up of small sided teams and 11-a-side

Khawaja Muhammad Zaman of Luari

Khawaja Muhammad Zaman of Luari 1713 - 1775 AD 1125 - 1188 AH was a sufi saint of Sindh and a poet He was the son of Shaikh Abdul Latif Siddiqi His father was a descendant of first Rashidun Caliph Abu Bakr As-?idd?q Their forefathers had moved to Sindh in Abbasid era
Biography
Shaikh Abdul Latif was follower of the Naqshbandi sufi sect so Muhammad Zaman learned Quran and Sufi teachings from his father Then he was sent to Thatta to study further in the Madrassa of Shaikh Muhammad Sadiq Naqshbandi who was a follower of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai There he met Khuwaja Abul Masakin who was a sufi saint and a follower of the Sirhandi saints and leaving the madrassa of Muhammad Sadiq Naqshbandi started sufi training under Abul Masakin and receiving the title of Sultan Al Aoliya Master of Sufis from him After some time Abul Masakin appointed him his successor and he went to Mecca for Hajj Khawaja Muhammad Zaman then started preaching sufism training people in the path of divine love By this time he was a complete Sheikh Later Muhammad Zaman moved to his home town Luari and continued his preaching there He attracted masses of people around him
By then he had become so famous that the saint and poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai came to Luari to meet him Latif expressed his desire to become his disciple but Muhammad Zaman asked him to withdraw from music and musical instruments Latif replied that I have spent whole of my life playing these instruments and sufi music in this last part of my life I cannot surrender it After this meeting Latif is said to have repeatedly recited this verse in praise of Muhammad Zaman
He died on January 6 1775 AD Dhul-Qadh 4 1188 AH and his tomb is in Luari Sindh
Poetry
Muhammad Zaman was also a sufi poet Though he is said to have said hundreds of poems but only 85 have been available in written form A collection of these poems is Abyat Sindhi Sindhi poems Shaikh Abdul Rahim Garhori one of his disciples has written a comprehensive commentary and explanation of these poems called Sharah Abyat Sindhi They reflect deep mysteries of sufism and general common sense Though he was a Naqshbandi and all Naqshbandi sufis follow Wahdat-ash-Shuh?d he seems to have merged Wahdat-ash-Shuh?d and Wahdat-al-Wuj?d in his poerty He says
O friends do not kill Mansoor as yarn is nothing else but cotton itself in modified form
When assemblage is gone there is no difference between two and one will definitely shout of the unity of existence
This implies that claim of Mansoor Ana-al-Haqq I am God Haqq is a name of God in Islam was not pointless as he had discovered the fact that his existence and that of universe was nothing but the manifestation of God's attributes as yarn is nothing but cotton therefore Mansoor should not be killed At some other point he says in favour of Shuh?d
Water and waves seem to be one thing not two
Some thought it is the reality while some perceived non existence of waves on their own
Means waves have no real existence of their own and are merely movement in water in the same way while the universe does not have its own existence it is not the same as God But generally it is considered that he was neither on side of Wahdat-al-Shuh?d completely nor in complete favour of Wahdat-al-Wuj?d instead he combined both ideologies to show that the differences in between them were merely of words and not real

Seychelles Medical and Dental Council

The Seychelles Medical and Dental Council SMDC was created in 1994 by the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Act Its function is regulatory
The logo of SMDC depicts the coco-de-mer the largest nut in the World and found only in Seychelles cut in cross-section and sitting on part of the leaf of the coco-de-mer tree It also depicts a unique and loose interpretation of the Rod or the Staff of Asclepius the symbol of healing The two snakes around the staff bear some resemblance to the Caduceus but they are not meant to depict the Caduceus One of the snakes is deliberately of a different blue colour SMDC regulates both the medical and dental professions and the two slightly different and yet similar snakes around the staff are meant to represent these two professions of healing
The main mandate of the Council is to register medical practitioners and dentists before they are able to start work in Seychelles as a doctor or dentist
Any practicing doctor or dentist in Seychelles who does not feature on the register of the Seychelles Medical and Dental Council is practicing medicine or dentistry illegally The list of registered Medical Practitioners and Dentists who are duly registered by the Council and are therefore able to practise legally is published in the Official Gazette or Government gazette of Seychelles at the beginning of each year The law dictates that this list must be published before 15 February of each year
The Seychelles Medical and Dental Council is also mandated to receive complaints from members of the public about the professional conduct or competence of medical practitioners and dentists and to investigate these complaints in a fair manner
The SMDC is additionally tasked with coordinating and facilitating the continuing professional development of all medical practitioners and dentists working in Seychelles
The current Chairman of the Seychelles Medical and Dental Council is Dr Bernard Valentin He was elected Chairman in November 2013 and his mandate will last until November 2015 The current governing board of the Seychelles Medical and Dental Council consists of twelve members appointed by the Minister for Health
The Minister appoints members of the Board according to precise criteria prescribed by the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Act Slots are reserved on the Council for the representative of the Seychelles Medical and Dental Association and any other professional association that regroups a sufficient number of doctors and/or dentists The doctors and dentists elect one doctor and one dentist to represent them on the Council
The offices of the Seychelles Medical and Dental Council are currently located in the Red Roof Building of Seychelles Hospital just opposite the Accident and Emergency Unit The Council's office is manned by a Registrar or Assistant Registrar
The Medical and Dental Professions in Seychelles
Seychelles is renowned for its 100% primary health care coverage and for its high turnover of doctors and dentists Of the roughly 150 doctors and dentists actively practicing in Seychelles either in government health facilities or private facilities about 60% are foreign-born Non-naturalized foreign-born doctors spend an average of two years in Seychelles before they are repatriated to their countries of origin
Most foreign doctors currently come from Cuba India China Sri Lanka for Government health facilities and Germany for Silhouette Island where there is a special arrangement with a medical company the hotel on that island and the company managing that island to provide doctors to the island A large number of these doctors have been registered by the Seychelles Medical and Dental Council
Training of Doctors and Dentists
Seychelles now has a new University called the University of Seychelles However that University does not have a medical school Seychellois doctors and dentists continue to be trained overseas in almost every corner of the World Over the past thirty years local doctors and dentists in Seychelles have been trained in United Kingdom France Germany Greece Cuba Russia New Zealand Zimbabwe South Africa Kenya Tanzania Czech Republic Slovakia Yugoslavia Malaysia India and other countries

Golovnin Incident

The Golovnin Incident involved the capture of Russian explorer and naval captain Vasily Golovnin in 1811 by soldiers of the Japanese Shogunate in accordance of Japan's policy of isolationism Sakoku Golovnin was interred in Japan for two years before being released in 1813 The incident was an important flashpoint in Russo-Japanese relations over the control of the Kuril islands Golovnin's book Memoirs of a Captivity in Japan during the Years 1811 1812 and 1813 with observations on the country and the people recounted his captivity was a popular work in Europe and was translated into several languages
Original Mission
In April 1811 the Russian minister of the Marine directed the sloop Diana to explore the Southern Kuril and Shantar Islands as well as the Tartary Coast Golovnin had originally been dispatched from Kronstadt to the North-West Pacific in 1807 to chart the eastern coast of the Russian Empire
In the 18th century Russian fur trappers had moved through Siberia towards the North-West Pacific and some had even settled in the Kurils Prior attempts to map the islands had proved difficult due to the mists that rose from the islands as well as strong winds The expedition would sail in the summer when conditions would be optimal and then Golovnin would continue to the Shantar Islands The Diana left Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on April 25 through the ice-flows and set to sea from Avacha Bay on the 4th of May Golovnin was conscientious of respecting relations between Russia and Japan as his voyage followed several diplomatic incidents with Japan such as the castaway incident of Daikokuya K?day? in 1784 the Adam Laxman incident of 1791 and Nikolai Rezanov's failed trade mission in 1805 Rezanov who then visited the United States was brought back to Siberia by Lieutenant Chwostoff in vessels belonging to the Russian-American Company but died when he reached Siberia in 1807 Chwostoff however proceeded to raid Japanese villages in Sakhalin and the Kurils without government authority
The Diana sailed to the island of Eetooroop and made contact with a group of Ainu or Kuriles who had been sent by the Japanese to investigate the Europeans Golovnin proceeded to meet the Japanese military commander of the island declaring his intention to collect wood and water and then be on his way The commander stated that they couldn't trust the Russians due to the actions of Chwostoff he agreed to send a letter to other commanders granting them access to supplies at the town of Oorbeetsch The Russians set sail but were then intercepted by a baidare a sort of Kayak with the Kuriles on board as well as a newcomer Alexei Maximovitsch Alexei joined the Russians as an interpreter though his proficiency in Russian was low Many of these Kuriles came from Russian controlled islands and had been punished for Chwostoff's attack on Japanese settlements thus feared and resented the Japanese Moreover the Japanese had brutally crushed an Ainu rebellion in 1789

European explorers had not yet discovered the straits between Hokkaido Matsmai and Kunashir prompting Golovnin to explore them on the 4th of July As the Diana approached the harbour at Kunashir it was fired upon by the Japanese castle After several attempts the Diana made contact with Japanese officers on the island They offered the necessary supplies as well as a meeting with the island's Bugy? or governor So as to clear the Russian government of responsibility from the Chwostoff raids Golovnin two officers four sailors and the Kurile Alexei landed There they were met by the governor of Kunashir in his castle Negotiations seemed amicable but the Japanese had lured Golovnin onto the island and arrested him and the other crew members
The crew was tightly bound with ropes whilst the Diana now under control of Petr Rikord shot at the castle but was then forced to set sail to avoid capture The captives were sailed across the straits to Hokkaido and encountered many villagers who were curious to see the Russians due to the almost complete absence of foreigners in Japan A Japanese drawing of their captivity shows the Russians tall stature compared to the Japanese which is also confirmed by Golovnin The crew was led to a prison in Hakodate the capital of Hokkaido
Captivity
The crew were kept in separate cells in a well guarded wooden prison During the imprisonment the Japanese began interrogating the officers with many precise questions revealing the lack of knowledge that both cultures had for the other On the 25th of August the commander brought Golovnin his personal wares from his cabin on the Diana much to his surprise but the Diana had not been captured but had simply sent these items ashore He was later brought before the governor of Hokkaido and made to discuss the events that took place by Resanov and Chwostoff The governor handed him a letter from the remaining officers of the Diana who explained why they were not able to save them in the Kurils and that they would work towards their release Golovnin was also provided with another letter written in 1806 by Chwostoff stating that he had annexed the island of Sakhalin in the name of the Tsar The Japanese had also annexed Sakhalin in 1807 in fear of growing Russian interference The letter convinced many of the Japanese that Golovnin was a Russian spy The Japanese continued pressing questions to Golovnin and he and the crew were moved to a new prison in Matsumae
After in depth interrogations for weeks the governor of Hokkaido contacted the central government in Edo to ask whether the Russians could be released In response the Japanese government sent a scholar called Teske a Dutch speaker to try and learn Russian to question the Russians and finally draw their portraits The government also sent renowned explorer Mamiya Rinz? who had been wounded in the skirmish with Chwostoff on Etrop to discover more about Russia's presence in the North-West Pacific
Escape Attempt
Golovnin and his crew began plotting to escape despite a great improvement of their treatment by the Japanese However one of the officers of German origin Moor had resolved to stay and pursue a life in Japan and had made significant progress in learning Japanese In March 1812 the Governor received a letter stating new orders from Edo to burn any Russian ships and imprison their crews Golovnin and the crew without Moor decide to make their escape into the mountains The crew went through the mountains to the shore to find a boat to commandeer but were arrested after eight days by soldiers and brought back into imprisonment The new governor Oga-Sawara-Isseno-Kami presented another letter from Chwostoff stating that his attack had been motivated by Japan's refusal to open trade with Russia They were forgiven for their escape attempt and moved back to more comfortable lodging
Release
After Golovnin's capture Rikord returned to Kamchatka to gain permission to attempt to rescue which was granted by the governor of Kamchatka as well having a document condemning Chwostoff's raid given to him He then attempted contact with the Japanese on Kunashir and was met with cannon fire and the message that the captured Russians were all dead In retaliation for the capture of Golovnin commander Petr Rikord of the Diana detained the Japanese ship Kansai Maru and took captive the wealthy merchant Takadaya Kahei as well as symbolically retaining four other Japanese and a Kurile whilst releasing the rest of the crew on Kunashir This action brought the two countries on the brink of war In March 1813 the new governor arrived prohibiting the firing on of Russian ships To assure the Russians of their continuing survival Golovnin and Moor wrote to Rikord informing them that they were still alive However two of the Japanese and one of the Ainu had died in captivity in Kamchatka seemingly of scurvy Moor scared of retaliation by the Russians when he was released endeavoured to upset the exchange of prisoners by warning that the Russians would attack the Japanese Negotiations were made between Rikord the governor of Hokkaido and the Japanese Government in Edo in which the Japanese were convinced that Chwostoff's action had not been condoned by the Russian government and that the crew of the Diana had gone to the Kurils without mal-intent towards the Japanese Kakadaya Kahei was released on the 29th of July as a show of good intention by Rikord An agreement was finally reached to negotiate with Rikord and offer safe passage to the Diana and Golovnin was released from prison in August 1813 with copies of all their negotiations with the Japanese as well as those of Resanov and Laxman to present to the Russian government The Diana arrived in late September and after deliberations with the governor Golovnin and his crew were officially released on the 6th of October
Aftermath
Golovnin's parting with the Japanese was amiable and both sides exchanged gifts whilst Rikord hosted a party on board the Diana for the Japanese The crew returned to Petropavlovsk but in despair and possibly madness Moor committed suicide The crew returned to St Petersburg in 1814 and were rewarded for their service The Golovnin incident did not establish a renaissance in diplomacy between Europe and Japan with the Japanese becoming increasingly fearful of the growing European presence in East Asia In 1825 the Japanese government enacted the Edict to Repel Foreign Vessels àŸçëëDë≈ï•óﬂ Ikokusen Uchiharairei requiring the burning of all European ships and the execution of their crews if they were to land outside of Nagasaki

The Tale of Li Wa

The Tale of Li Wa is a novel by Bai Xingjian or Bo Xingjian
Song Geng C ëv çk P Song G?ng author of The Fragile Scholar Power and Masculinity in Chinese Culture wrote that this was one of three Tang Dynasty works that were particularly influential in the development of the caizi-jiaren model There is a poem by Yuan Zhen The Ballad of Li Wa that is a companion to the novel
It was translated into English by Arthur Waley who used the title The Story of Miss Li and included it on pages 113-36 in the collection More Translations from the Chinese which was published in 1919 by Alfred A Knopf It was also translated into English by Glen Dudbridge who used the title The Tale of Li Wa Study and Critical Edition of a Chinese Story from the Ninth Century This version was published in 1983 by Ithaca Press
Linda Rui Feng of the University of Toronto wrote that the novel features the unpredictability and unintelligibility of Chang'an and a conflict between career accomplishment and youthful transgressions
Development
There is a debate over two possibilities of how the story evolved One group believes that in 795 three friends told the story amongst one another Another position states that a professional storyteller had performed in front of Bai Xingjian and Bai Juyi and Yuan Zhen and that Bai Xingjian obtained the story from the storyteller One author Tatsuhiko Seo believes that the story comes from a storyteller
Plot
The story involves a tribute student a provincial examinee Zheng trying to get the affections of Li Wa a female prostitute in Chang'an The protagonist spends his money on Li Wa and neglects his studying for the imperial examinations He lives with Li Wa for two years and spends all of his money which is ultimately exhausted Li Wa is not the only aspect obstructing Student Zheng from his studies There are portions of the story that as written by Feng are devoted to a world without her in fact takes on an impetus and logic all of its own
After Zheng can no longer pay the prostitution costs Li Wa abandons him as does her madam Student Zheng begins working at a funeral parlor as a dirge singer and at one point is the winner of a singing competition The student's father discovers him while visiting Chang'an severely beats him as he is upset that his son is in this condition The father leaves the son for dead disowning him Later Li Wa encounters the protagonist who is now a beggar She helps him recover his health reconcile with his father and study for the examinations The father exclaims that he and his son are father and son as before C ïÉéqî@èâ P fuz? ruch? W fu-tzu ju-ch'u when they reconcile Student Zheng remains devoted to Li Wa and the two marry
Analysis
S-C Kevin Tsai of Princeton University wrote that in critical literature usually reach conclusions that do not depart far from the conventional May-Fourth-derived reading of the story as resistance against oppression and that The majority of Chinese literary criticism focusing on gender in the Tale of Li Wa generally
does not depart far from this conclusion In Tanren Chuanqi ìÇêl?äÔ/ìÇêlôBäÔ a book published in Taipei in 1990 by Sanmin shuju Wu Zhida ?éu?/?éuíB stated that The Tale of Li Wa is a victory song against the aristocratic marriage institution
Glen Dudbridge's monograph The Tale of Li Wa Study and Critical Edition of a Chinese Story from the Ninth Century includes annotations to provide understanding for Western readers He wrote an article named A Second Look at Li Wa zhuan defending his method of providing annotations
Some scholars who study the culture of the Tang Dynasty perceive the story as in the words of Tsai a relatively straightforward storehouse of social data for instance some study the tale for the detailed descriptions of capital city life in the tale Scholars focusing on the philology include Bian Xiaoxuan ôƒçFäû Dai Wangshu Wang Meng'ou â§öÎ?/â§ñ≤? Zhang Zhenglang ?ê≠?/í£ê≠? and Zhou Shaoliang é¸?ó«/é¸è–ó« Nienhauser stated that Wang Meng'ou's Tangren xiaoshuo jiaoshi is the best modern annotation of Li Wa zhuan and that Dudbridge's resonances
are often measured against Tangren xiaoshuo jiaoshi ìÇêlè¨?çZÁ◊/ìÇêlè¨?çZ?
Bian Xiaoxuan and Liu Kairong ???/ó´äJûƒ believe the work is a roman a clef Accordingly they attempted to figure out what the allegory and the identity of the basis of Student Zheng
Audiences
Nienhauser wrote that While the exact constituency of Tang Dynasty readers cannot be determined Bo Xingjian and other tale writers clearly targeted those members of the Tang elite who were themselves active in literature men who obviously could recognize even the most erudite allusion Nienhauser explained that the inner audience-perhaps the primary audience of the story consisted of men taking the Tang Dynasty imperial examinations
As of 2007 modern audiences include Chinese readers and Western sinologists The latter according to Nienhauser are aided by various databases that may allow even encourage over-reading of resonances He added that The modern Chinese audience shares this potential
Legacy
There have been dramas made based on The Tale of Li Wa There is a farce A Noontime Dream in the Garden Grove which portrays a dispute between Li Wa and Oriole the female protagonist of The Story of the Western Wing

Copies of the letters
The CKU letters are known only through copies written on clay tablets as school exercises by students learning to write cuneiform All but one of the known copies have been dated to the Old Babylonian period and were found in cities of Mesopotamia or the broader Near East including Nippur Ur Isin Uruk Kish Sippar and Susa A single tablet bearing copies of two of the letters and dating to the Middle Babylonian period was also found at Susa About 115 cuneiform tablets bearing copies of one or more CKU letters are currently known
Content and structure
The CKU letters are written in a literary style of Sumerian prose They loosely conform to the following structure
Most of the letters are presented as an exchange between a king of the Ur III dynasty and one of his officials some of whom are known historical figures ? e.g the general Aradmu and later king of Isin I?bi-Erra usually discussing matters of state or administration Some of the topics that show up include difficulties in dealing with particular officials the building and repair of fortifications reports about securing the provinces and the completion of other assignments and accusations of disloyalty or injustice directed towards other officials

Controversy about historicity of the letters
The historical authenticity of the Correspondence of the Kings of Ur ? the question of whether they originally date as they purport to the Ur III period or whether they were composed during Old Babylonian compositions ? is a highly contested and complicated issue For many years the letters were treated as one of the best sources of information for reconstructing political events of the Ur III period especially the end of the kingdom The modernistic account of the end of the Ur III dynasty for example catastrophic collapse due to factors such as Amorite invasions environmental disasters and crop failures and the rise of bloated bureaucracy is largely based on CKU However the historicity of the letters has recently been called into question sparking at times intense debate among scholars over the past decade In 2001 Fabienne Huber published an article entitled ÅgLa Correspondance Royale dÅfUr un corpus apocryphe,Åh in which she argued that the corpus was entirely apocryphal This argument was based primarily on the occurrence of post-Ur III linguistic features of borrowings between the letters and of post-Ur III personal names and place names In response to HuberÅfs article W W Hallo wrote an adamant defense of the CKUÅfs authenticity arguing that nearly all of the letters were copied from Ur III archival letters and can be used as invaluable historical sources Piotr Michalowski in his 2011 publication of the entire CKU presented an argument against both viewpoints Instead he took the position that some elements of authentic Ur III letters were incorporated into the Old Babylonian curriculum but that these were extensively redacted in some cases it is possible to tell that a letter was fabricated while in others it is more likely that the core of the letter represents original Ur III content In a review of MichalowskiÅfs book Pascal Attinger defended HuberÅfs position against MichalowskiÅfs critiques


St Mary's Church Reculver

St Mary's Church Reculver was founded as a monastery in the 7th century on the site of a Roman fort at Reculver which was then at the north-eastern extremity of Kent in south-eastern England In 669 the site of the fort was given for this purpose to a priest named Bassa by King Ecgberht of Kent beginning a connection with Kentish kings which led to the monastery becoming very wealthy by the end of the 8th century during which King Eadberht II of Kent was buried there From the early 9th century the monastery was in the hands of the archbishops of Canterbury who treated it essentially as a piece of property Viking attacks may have ended its status as a monastery although an early 11th-century record indicates that it was then in the hands of a dean accompanied by monks By the time of Domesday Book completed in 1086 the building served as a parish church
The original building which incorporated materials from the Roman fort was a simple one consisting only of a nave and an apsidal chancel with a small room or porticus built out from each of the church's northern and southern sides where the nave and chancel met The church was much altered and expanded over the course of the Middle Ages the last addition in the 15th century being north and south porches leading into the nave This expansion coincided with a long period of prosperity for the settlement of Reculver but the settlement's decline led to the decay and in the face of coastal erosion the demolition of most of the church in 1809
The church's twin towers were preserved by the intervention of Trinity House since they had long been important as a landmark for shipping Some materials from the structure were incorporated into a replacement church also dedicated to St Mary built at Hillborough in the same parish Much of the rest was used for the building of a new harbour wall at Margate known as Margate Pier Other remnants of the church apart from those on the site include fragments of a high cross of stone which stood inside the church and two stone columns which formed part of an arch between the nave and chancel of the original church and were still in place when the church was demolished These are now kept in Canterbury Cathedral and are among features which have led to the description of the church as an exemplar of Anglo-Saxon church architecture and sculpture
Monastic origins
The first church at Reculver was founded in 669 when King Ecgberht of Kent gave land at Reculver to Bassa the priest on which to build a minster The author of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle clearly considered foundation of this church to be a significant event and it may be that King Ecgberht's intention in founding a church at Reculver was to create an ecclesiastical centre with a strong English element to counterbalance domination of the Canterbury church by Archbishop Theodore from Tarsus now in Turkey Abbot Hadrian of St Augustine's from North Africa probably Cyrenaica and their equally non-native followers The church was certainly regarded as a monastery by 679 when King Hlothhere of Kent granted land to its abbot Berhtwald
The foundation of this church sited within the remains of the Roman fort of Regulbium exemplifies the widespread practice Anglo-Saxon England of re-using Roman walled places for major churches and the new church was built almost completely from demolished Roman structures The original structure formed a nave measuring by and an apsidal chancel which was externally polygonal but internally round and was entered from the nave through a triple arch formed by two columns made of limestone from Marquise in the Pas-de-Calais region of northern France The arches were formed using Roman tiles but the columns were made for the church rather than being Roman in origin Around the inside of the apse was a stone bench and two small rooms or porticus forming rudimentary transepts were built out from the north and south sides of the church where the nave met the chancel from which they could be accessed The presence of a stone bench around the inside of the apse has been attributed to influence from the Syrian Church at a time when its followers were being displaced The walls of the church were rendered both inside and out giving them a plain appearance and hiding the masonry
Ten years after the foundation of the church in 679 King Hlothhere of Kent granted lands at Sturry about south-west of Reculver and at Sarre in the western part of the Isle of Thanet across the Wantsum Channel to the east to Abbot Berhtwald and to the monastery The grant was made at Reculver the charter in which it was recorded was probably written by a Reculver scribe and the grant of Sarre in particular is significant
In the original 7th-century charter recording this grant Reculver is referred to as a civitas or city but this is probably a reference to either its Roman past or the church's monastic status rather than a large population centre In 692 Reculver's abbot Berhtwald a former abbot of Glastonbury in Somerset was elected Archbishop of Canterbury Bede writing no more than 40 years later described him as having been well educated in the Bible and experienced in ecclesiastical and monastic affairs but in terms indicating that Berhtwald was not a scholar
Further charters show that the monastery at Reculver continued to benefit from Kentish kings in the 8th century under abbots Heahberht Deneheah and Hwitred acquiring lands in Higham Upshire and Sheldwich and exemption from the toll due on one ship at Fordwich and King Eadberht II of Kent was buried there in the 760s Other properties belonging to Reculver are mentioned in passing by otherwise unrelated records such as a pre-existing estate at Higham Upshire land probably in the High Weald area of Kent from which iron may have been sourced for use or sale at or on behalf of Reculver and an unidentified property named Dunwaling land in the district of Eastry By the early 9th century the monastery had become extremely wealthy but from then on it appears in records as essentially a piece of property In 811 control of the monastery was in the hands of Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury who is recorded as having deprived it of some of its land and soon after the monastery at Reculver featured in a monumental showdown between Archbishop Wulfred and King Coenwulf of Mercia over the control of monasteries to which the subsequent control of Reculver by archbishops of Canterbury has been attributed By the 10th century the monastery at Reculver had ceased to be an important church in Kent and together with its territory it was under the control of the kings of Wessex In a charter of 949 King Eadred of England gave Reculver back to the archbishops of Canterbury at which time the estate included Hoath and Herne land at Sarre in Thanet and land at Chilmington about south-west of Reculver
Monastery to parish church
Reculver may have remained home to a monastic community into the 10th century despite the likelihood of Viking attacks which began in Kent before 800 but grew intense after 835 It is possible that the abbot and monastic community of Reculver took refuge from the Vikings in Canterbury as the abbess and community of Lyminge did in 804 A monk of Reculver named Ymar was recorded as a saint in the early 15th century by Thomas Elmham who found the name in a martyrology and wrote that Ymar was buried in St JohnÅfs church Margate Ymar was probably killed by Vikings in the 10th century and hence regarded as a martyr The Church in East Kent seems broadly to have preserved its primary character against all the odds but evidence for the monastery at Reculver is lacking by the 10th century both the church and its territory were in the hands of the kings of Wessex and by the 11th century the monastery had dropped out of sight entirely The last abbot is recorded as Wenredus though when he was abbot is unknown The church was last described as a monastery in about 1030 when it was governed by a dean named Givehard and was home to monks two of whom are named as Fresnot and Tancrad these names indicate the presence of a religious community of Continental origin probably Flemings
By 1066 the monastery had become a parish church with no baptismal function and its territory had become part of the endowment of the archbishops of Canterbury Domesday Book records the archbishop's annual income from Reculver in 1086 as Åí42.7s Åí42.35 this value can be compared with for example the Åí20 due to him from the manor of Maidstone and Åí50 from the borough of Sandwich Included in the Domesday account for Reculver as well as the church farmland a mill salt pans and a fishery are 90?villeins and 25?bordars these numbers can be multiplied four or five times to account for dependents as they only represent adult male heads of households
By the 13th century Reculver parish provided an ecclesiastical benefice of exceptional wealth which led to disputes between lay and Church interests In 1291 the Taxatio of Pope Nicholas IV put the total income due to the rector and vicar of Reculver at about Åí130 Included in the parish were chapels of ease at St Nicholas-at-Wade and All Saints both on the Isle of Thanet and at Hoath and Herne The parish was broken up in 1310 by Robert Winchelsey archbishop of Canterbury from 1294 to 1313 who created parishes from Reculver's chapelries at Herne and on the Isle of Thanet St Nicholas-at-Wade and All Saints in response to the difficulties posed by the distance between them and their mother church at Reculver and a steady increase in population At this time All Saints became part of St Nicholas-at-Wade parish and its church was later demolished However St Mary's church Reculver continued to receive payments from the parishes of Herne and St Nicholas-at-Wade in the 19th century as a token of subjection to Reculver as well as for the repair of St Mary's church and it retained a perpetual curacy at Hoath into the 20th century
Enlargement and decline
Enlargement
The church building was considerably enlarged over time the outer walls of the porticus were extended to enclose the nave in the 8th century forming a series of rooms including chapels on both northern and southern sides and a porch across the western side the towers were added as part of an extension with a new west front in the late 12th century when the internal walls of the porticus were demolished creating aisles on the north and south sides of the nave the original apse was demolished and the chancel more than doubled in size incorporating a triple east window with columns of Purbeck marble in the 13th century and north and south porches were added to the nave in the 15th century A chantry in the church was endowed in 1354 in memory of Alicia de Brouke and two more were endowed in 1371 by Thomas Niewe a former vicar of Reculver These chantries were suppressed in the reign of Edward VI in 1548 or very early in 1549 The towers were topped with spires by 1414 since they are shown in an illustrated map drawn by Thomas Elmham in or before that year and one of the towers held a ring of bells The addition of the towers an extraordinary investment for a parish church and the extent to which the church was enlarged in the Middle Ages suggest that a thriving township must have developed nearby However the church retained many prominent Anglo-Saxon features and on a visit to Reculver in 1540 one of these raised John Leland to an enthusiasm which he seldom displayed
This high cross had been removed from the church by 1784 Archaeologists examined what was believed to be the base of a 7th?century cross in 1878 and the 1920s and it has been suggested that the monastery at Reculver was originally built around it The Reculver cross has been compared with the Anglo-Saxon Ruthwell Cross?? an open-air preaching cross in Dumfries and Galloway Scotland?? and traces of paint on fragments of the Reculver cross show that its details were once multicoloured Later stylistic assessments indicate that the cross carved from a re-used Roman column probably dates from the 8th century or the 9th and that the stone believed to have been the base may have been the original 7th-century altar Leland also mentioned a wall painting of an unidentified bishop on the north side of the church under an arch Another item found in the church by Leland which dated to the Anglo-Saxon period was a gospel book this was
In its final form the church consisted of a nave long by wide with north and south aisles of the same length and wide and a chancel long by wide Including the spires the towers were high the towers alone which survive reaching The towers measure square internally and are connected internally by a gallery which was about above the floor of the nave The full length of the church east to west was and the breadth of the west front which also survives is
Decline
When Leland visited Reculver in 1540 he noted that the coastline to the north had receded to within little more than a quarter of a mile 402?m of the Towne at this tyme was but Village lyke Soon after in 1576 William Lambarde described Reculver as poore and simple In 1588 there were 165 communicants?? people in Reculver parish taking part in services of holy communion at the church?? and in 1640 there were 169 but a map of about 1630 shows that the church then stood only about from the shore In January 1658 the local justices of the peace were petitioned concerning encroachments of the sea had since Michaelmas last 1657 encroached on the land near six rods and will doubtless do more harm The village's failure to support two beer shops in the 1660s points clearly to a declining population and the village was mostly abandoned around the end of the 18th century its residents moving to Hillborough about south-west of Reculver but within Reculver parish
The decline of the settlement led to the decline of the church In 1776 Thomas Philipot described the church as full of solitude and languished into decay In 1787 John Pridden noticed that the roofline of the nave must have been lowered at some time judging by the tops of the east and west walls and the fact that the tops of the two windows over the west door were at that time filled in with brick he also noted that the roof had been repaired in 1775 by churchwarden A Sayer these details appearing embossed on replacement lead But he described the church as a weather-beaten building mouldering away by the fury of the elements and a letter to The Gentleman's Magazine in 1809 said that it was then somewhat dilapidated with trifling repairs such as have only tended to obliterate its once-harmonizing beauties
Destruction
In the autumn of 1807 a northerly storm combined with a high tide brought erosion of the cliff on which the church stood to within the churchyard destroying ten yards 9.1?m of the wall around the churchyard not ten yards from the foundation of the church Sea defences had been in place since at least 1783 but although they had been costly to build their design had led to further undermining of the cliff Two further schemes were devised by Sir Thomas Page and John Rennie to preserve the cliff by means of new sea defences Rennie's being estimated to cost Åí8,277 Instead at a vestry meeting on 12?January 1808 and at the instigation of the vicar Christopher Naylor it was decided that the church should be demolished The decision was reached by vote among eight of the leading residents of Reculver and Hoath including the vicar the votes were evenly split so the vicar used his casting vote in favour of demolition This was begun in September 1809 using gunpowder in what has been described as an act of vandalism for which there can be few parallels even in the blackest records of the nineteenth century
The demolition of this shrine of early Christendom and exemplar of Anglo-Saxon church architecture and sculpture was otherwise thorough and it is now represented only by the ruins on the site material incorporated into a replacement parish church at Hillborough fragments of the cross and the two stone columns which had been part of the church's triple arch The columns and fragments of the cross are on display in Canterbury Cathedral Two thousand tons of stone from the demolished church were sold and incorporated into the harbour wall at Margate known as Margate Pier which was completed in 1815 and more than 40?tons of lead was stripped from the church and sold for Åí900 Trinity House bought what was left of the structure from the parish for Åí100 to ensure that the towers were preserved as a navigational aid and built the first groynes designed to protect the cliff on which the ruins stand The spires were both destroyed by storms by 1819 when Trinity House replaced them with similarly shaped open structures topped by wind vanes These structures remained until they were removed some time after 1928 The ruins of the church and the site of the Roman fort within which it was built are now in the care of English Heritage and the sea defences protecting the church continue to be maintained by Trinity House
Archaeology
The first report containing archaeological information on the then demolished church of St Mary was published by George Dowker in 1878 He described finding the foundations of the apsidal chancel and of the columns which formed part of the triple chancel arch and noted that the original floor of the church was of concrete or opus signinum and was only laid within the walls of the earliest church The floor had previously been described in 1782 prior to the church's demolition as polished smooth and finished in red a sample having been taken with difficulty using a pickaxe Within the floor Dowker also found what he believed were the foundations for the stone cross described by Leland and noted that the concrete floor appeared to have been laid around them The floor of the chancel appeared to have been raised by about when the chancel was extended and had been covered with encaustic tiles Dowker also reported hearing from a Mr Holmans about the existence of a large circular burial vault at the east end of the chancel containing coffins arranged in a circle
Further excavations were undertaken in the 1920s by C R Peers who reported on them in 1927 Peers found that the nave of the original church had external doors on the north south and west sides of the nave and that the chancel had doors leading into the north and south porticus which in turn had external doors on their eastern sides Regarding the floor described by Dowker Peers noted that the surface consisted of a thin layer of pounded brick and believed that it was of the same date as the stone which Dowker described as the foundations for the stone cross The excavations in 1927 also revealed steps leading down to the burial vault reported by Dowker although Peers made no mention of either the steps or the vault in his report Extensions of the porticus to the west and around the original west front were dated to no more than 100?years after the church was first built and Peers observed that these extensions had been given the same type of floor as the original church Drawing comparisons with the 7th-century chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall at Bradwell-on-Sea in Essex and the abbey of St Augustine at Canterbury Peers suggested that the original church at Reculver probably had windows set high in the northern and southern walls of the nave Areas of wall which were found by archaeologists but are now missing above ground are marked on the site by strips of concrete edged with flint
The church was found to have been free-standing so any other monastic buildings must have stood apart No such buildings have been found but they may all have been in the area to the north of the church which has been lost to the sea In this connection Peers noted that the cloisters of the early Canterbury churches of St Augustine's and Christ Church were both on their northern sides A building which stood west-northwest of the church may have had an Anglo-Saxon doorway and the dimensions of an Anglo-Saxon church and had the appearance of having been part of some monastic erection It was demolished after the sea weakened its foundations during storms in the winter of 1782 Leland reported another building outside the churchyard where it was believed that a parish church had stood while the main church at Reculver was still a monastery this building formerly a chapel dedicated to St James was later known as the chapel-house and stood in the north-eastern corner of the fort until it collapsed into the sea on 13?October 1802 Peers noted further that it seems to have had brick arches
St John's Cathedral Parramatta
The design of the twin towers spires and west front of St John's Cathedral Parramatta in Sydney Australia which were added in 1817?1819 is based on those of St Mary's church at Reculver Efforts to save St Mary's church were still under way when Governor Lachlan Macquarie and his wife Elizabeth had left England for Australia in 1809 Elizabeth Macquarie asked John Watts the governor's aide-de-camp from 1814 to 1819 to design the towers
The towers and west front of St John's Cathedral are the oldest remaining parts of an Anglican church in Australia and are on the oldest site of continuous Christian worship there In 1990 a stone from Reculver was presented to St John's Cathedral by the Historic Building and Monuments Commission for England now English Heritage

On the road to Umberleigh five miles from South Molton there stands a fine old English mansion called Hudscott where at this time 1662 there lived a noble puritan lady who like Phoebe had been a succour of many It was her delight to entertain such men as John Flavel of Torrington and other dejected ministers whose writings the labours of a forced retirement have become the inheritance of the whole church
This referred to about two thousand puritan clergy who after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 had refused to use the Book of Common Prayer which had been banned during the Commonwealth but then had been restored for compulsory usage by the Act of Uniformity 1662 Such clergy were then ejected from their livings and in 1664 were forbidden by Parliament having passed the Five Mile Act to preach within 5 miles of an incorporated town The house incorporates a small former chapel which may have been used during this time Another of the rare Devonshire protectoresses of ejected clergy at this time was Rachael Fane 1612/13-1680 wife of Henry Bourchier 5th Earl of Bath of Tawstock Court near Barnstaple whose monument in Tawstock Church states She was a humble and devout daughter of the Church of England and in times of persecution a mother to the ejected Fathers and in these parts almost their only protectress

John II Lovering appears to have been an exporter of herring fish to Spain as the following recorded lawsuit of 1658 suggests John Martin v John Lovering Consignment of fish to St Lucar or Seville in Spain Touching a former suit also Devon Spain
He is mentioned in the historical romance Lorna Doone 1869 by Richard Doddridge Blackmore as follows
And it is a very grievous thing which touches small landowners to see an ancient family day by day decaying and when we heard that Ley Barton itself and all the Manor of Lynton were under a heavy mortgage debt to John Lovering of Weare-Gifford there was not much in our little way that we would not gladly do or suffer for the benefit of De Whichehalse
Chanter 1906 states the account in Lorna Doone to be confused
John II Lovering married Elizabeth Venner heiress of Hudscott He had by Elizabeth two sons John Lovering and Venner Lovering who both predeceased their father without progeny and two daughters

Lingwa de planeta

Lingwa de planeta also Lidepla LdP is a constructed international auxiliary language whose development began in 2006 in Saint-Petersburg Russia by a group of enthusiasts with Dmitri Ivanov being the project leader The basic version of the language was published in 2010 Lidepla is based on the most widely spoken languages of the world including Arabic Chinese English French German Hindi Persian Portuguese Russian and Spanish
Concept
The main idea was to create a harmonious whole on the base of the most widespread and influential national languages of the planet That results in the Lidepla vocabulary containing a fairly significant amount of non-European words making Lidepla a worldlang A general design principle for Lidepla was to have something in common with the native languages of most of the people on Earth
Project team and use of the language
The project leader is a psychologist Dmitri Ivanov He laid the foundation of the language Linguists A.Vinogradova and E.Ivanova helped a lot during the early period of Lidepla development In 2007 A Lysenko joined and became the main linguist of the project
From the very beginning the project was open and widely discussed in a number of conlanger groups As of 2014 more than 15 people contributed to the language considerably that is worked on vocabulary and grammar translated and wrote original texts including songs not speaking about those who participated in discussions
At the moment the language is used in real communication mainly in Internet facebook yahoo etc About 10-15 people master the language about 50 can use it in communication There are a lot of texts translated including rather spacious texts like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Lewis Carroll and Sailor Ruterford in Maori captivity by Nikolay Chukovsky son of Korney Chukovsky translated from Russian and also some fairy-tales and tales There are songs written/translated and sung including an album of professional musician eo:Jonny.M and subtitles made for cartoons and films like popular Russian film
Description of the language
In some sources the date of creation of Lidepla is stated to be 2006 It is important to say though that the basic version of the language was published only in 2010 The basics of the language is not to be changed after that
Phonology
There are 17 basic consonants b d g p t k w f s ? x d?? d?z m n r l and 3 optional ones v t?? ? in Lidepla
Distinction of the sounds w ? v d?? ? t?? is not obligatory that is they may be pronounced in the same way as there are no minimal pairs for them The ? sound is the same as in English in -ing ending
There are 5 vowels a e i o u in the language
Alphabet and pronunciation
The official Lidepla alphabet is based on the Latin script and has 25 letters
The general rule regarding the stress is the vowel before the last consonant or y is stressed mata mother familia family aksham evening ruchey brook Lidepla tries to preserve the original sounding of the international words though so there are some exceptions as follows
Vocabulary
Most Lidepla vocabulary is made up of international words of Latin origin The part of the most frequent words are of English Russian Chinese Arabic and Hindi origin though There are not definite endings for different parts of speech so nearly any word can be easily incorporated the words are adapted to Lidepla phonology and don't preserve original orthography
As of 2014 in Lidepla vocabulary there are about 4000 entries meaning about 10 000 individual words The number is constantly increasing For a word to be incorporated the following principles are taken into account
The whole Lidepla phrases sometimes sound very close to the national languages ones
Grammar
The Lidepla grammar is based on 3 rules
Rule of belonging to a word class
Every Lidepla word belongs to a word class noun verb adjective adverb etc Derivation takes place by means of affixes and particles
There are no fixed endings for the word classes there are preferable though Thus most verbs end in i but there are some exceptions jan to know shwo to talk etc
Derivation
By means of affixes and particles new words can be made up both of the same class and of the other For example
Rule of the constant form
The word form never chages Special particles are used to express the grammatical meanings for example
The only two exceptions are
Principle of necessity
The use of special particle is optional if its meaning is clear from the context For example
Rule of direct word order
The word order in a sentence is usually direct that is subject ? predicate ? object attribute goes before the noun prepositions are before the noun group they refer to
If the word order is changed it is shown by the use of special particles for example den is put before theobject for example Ela lubi lu Den lu ela lubi ? She loves him

Marseilles moraine

Distribution
The Marseilles moraine was preceded by the Bloomington morainic system The name is taken from the village of Marseilles located where the Illinois River cuts through the moraine The moraine is readily traced as far north as South Elgin south of the city of Elgin where it is lost in a composite of other mateirals For south it combinew with a till ridge called the Minooka Ridge This follows the east side of Fox River past St Charles Geneva Batavio and Aurora The east side of each city occupies the outer face of the moraine The width of the belt is or The moraine continues south along the line of Will and Kendall counties It runs about or beyond the river The Marseilles moraine turns west at the bluff between Oswego and Yorkville The Minooka Ridge continues southward to the Illinois River The Marseilles moraine follows nearly the southeast bluff of Fox River to the mouth of the stream its outer border being nowhere more than and usually less than from the stream The width in Kendall County is only 2 or 3 miles but increases to 5 or 6 miles in northeastern LaSalle County near the north bluff of the Illinois River
At the Illinois Valley it changes from southsouthwest to a south-southeast course It maintains a to width through southeastern Lasalle and northern Livington counties It is associated with Farm Ridge in Livingston County The Farm Ridge is an inner ridge of the Bloomington system In the vicinity of Odell the moraine turns eastward and near the line of Livingston and Ford counties takes a course northeast in broad curve of or wide Reaching the vicinity of Ste Anne where it turns southeast
Iroquois moraine continuation
From Ste Anne it continues to the southeast reaching the state line Here the name changes to the Iroquois Continuing through Newton and Jasper counties Indiana The moraine expands to cover a to in width across the landscapes as far as Medaryville in Pulaski County Indiana To the east it disappears It may end here or itÅfs remnants may be obscured beneath the Lake Kankakee sand ridges
The rise from the plain to the crest of the moraine on the north amounts to high about and on the south to to in less than The width of the Iroquois moraine is generally between but bouldery areas on its north border extend about farther north to the southern edge of an extensive sandy plain traversed by Kankakee River
The southern border of the ÅeÅfIroquoisÅfÅf moraine lies to north of Iroquois River in Newton and Jasper counties and trends southwest and northeast In eastern Jasper it turns northward It dies out as a definite ridge south of Kankakee River
Some uncertainty remains on whether it continues to the east One possible correlative is a moraine which begins near Bass Lake in Starke County Between eastern Jasper County and Bass Lake the area is generally sand covered with a broad low ridge running form the north end of the Iroquois moraine at San Pierre to North Judson This ridge has patches of boulders in the till line from North Judson to Bass Lake as do many other moraines in northern Indiana The moraine from Bass Lake runs to the southeast and was formed by the Saginaw lobe of the Laruentide glacier and is the outer border of the great Maxinkuckee moraine
Altitude & Topography
The crest is around above sea level and varies only about The outer border of the moraine follows closely along the contour line along its border The inside border runs close to the
The Marseilles moraine has a well-defined crest which acts as a watershed divide North of the Illinois River it lies between the Fox River and the Dupage River Au Sable Creek and Nettle Creek South of the Illinois lies between the Vermilion Rivers tributaries and the Kankakee River A branch of it that runs north of the Iroquois River and south of Kankakee River is split by the Iroquois River at several places The sharpest relief is in Kendall County Illinois a ridge stands to above the adjacent part of the moraine This is unusual as the grest is a broad undulating ridge of to in width with depression that are seasonally water filled The majority of the crest is a series of swells seldom exceeding with easy slopes In Livingston County the swells reach above the surrounding sloughs Another prominent set of knolls are along the Kankakee and Iroqouis counties Here the knolls reach or more above the surrounding moraine
The highest points noted on the Marseilles system in the district north of Iroquois River are north of Rensselaer where an altitude of to above sea level is attained Much of the moraine reaches between and
Outwash
Along Fox River in Kane and Kendall counties a belt of coarse gravel lines the outside of the Marseilles moraine The deposit lay mostly the across the river from the moraine At Batavia it is chiefly on the west side at Aurora on the east side and at Yorkville on the west side The gravel is so extensive in Kane and Kendal counties and so small farther down Fox River as to suggest that it forms a delta
In the vicinity of the Illinois River there are indications of a lake-like expansion of outflowing waters The Illinois Valley therefore appears to have been unopened along the section between the Marseilles moraine and the inner moraine of the Bloomington series
The basin now drained by the Iroquois River into the Kankakee was blocked by ice in that direction The outlet would have been west across the rim of the basin in northern Ford County into the east fork of Vermilion River Evidence of fine sand and silt covering the till plain show that a Lake Watseka occupied this park of the Iroquois valley

Russian Social Democratic Labour Party

In Russia proper
The RSDLP was not the first Russian Marxist group the Emancipation of Labour group was formed in 1883 The RSDLP was created to oppose narodnichestvo revolutionary populism which was later represented by the Socialist-Revolutionary Party SRs The RSDLP program was based on the theories of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels - that despite Russia's agrarian nature the true revolutionary potential lay with the industrial working class The RSDLP was illegal for most of its existence at the end of the first party congress in March 1898 all nine delegates were arrested by the Imperial Russian Police At this time there were 3 million Russian industrial workers just 3% of the population
Before the Second Congress a young intellectual named Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov joined the party better known by his pseudonym?Vladimir Lenin In 1902 he had published What is to be Done outlining his view of the party's task and methodology?to form the vanguard of the proletariat He advocated a disciplined centralised party of committed activists
In 1903 the Second Congress of the party met in exile in Brussels to attempt to create a united force However after unprecedented attention from the Belgian authorities the congress moved to London meeting on August 11 in a chapel in Tottenham Court Road At the congress the party split into two irreconcilable factions on November 17 the Bolsheviks derived from Bolshinstvo"?Russian for majority headed by Lenin and the Mensheviks from Menshinstvo"?Russian for minority headed by Julius Martov Confusingly the Mensheviks were actually the larger faction however the names Menshevik and Bolshevik were taken from a vote held at the 1903 party congress for the editorial board of the party newspaper Iskra Spark with the Bolsheviks being the majority and the Mensheviks being the minority These were the names used by the factions for the rest of the party congress and these are the names retained after the split at the 1903 congress Lenin's faction later ended up in the minority and remained smaller than the Mensheviks until the Russian Revolution of 1917
A central issue at the congress was the question of the definition of party membership Martov proposed the formulation A member of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party is one who accepts the PartyÅfs programme supports the Party financially and renders it regular personal assistance under the direction of one of its organisations Lenin on the other hand proposed a more strict definition ÅgA member of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party is one who accepts its programme and who supports the Party both financially and by personal participation in one of the Party organisations Martov won the vote and the bolsheviks accepted it as part of the adopted organisational rules
Despite a number of attempts at reunification the split proved permanent As time passed more ideological differences emerged According to many historians the Bolsheviks pushed for an almost immediate proletarian revolution while the Mensheviks believed that Russia was still at too early a stage in history for an immediate working-class revolution The two warring factions both agreed that the coming revolution would primarily be bourgeois democratic in its character But while the mensheviks viewed the liberals as the main ally the bolsheviks opted for an alliance with the peasantry as the only way to carry out a popular revolution while defending the interests of the working class Essentially the difference was that the bolsheviks considered that in Russia the tasks of the bourgeois democratic revolution would have to be carried out without the participation of the bourgeoisie
The Third Congress of the party 1905 was held separately by the Bolsheviks The Fourth Congress 1906 was held in Stockholm Sweden and saw a formal reunification of the two factions with the Mensheviks in the majority but the discrepancies between Bolshevik and Menshevik views became particularly clear during the proceedings
The Fifth Congress of the party was held in London England in 1907 it consolidated the supremacy of the Bolshevik faction and debated strategy for communist revolution in Russia Stalin never later referred to his stay in London
The Social Democrats SDs boycotted elections to the First Duma April?July 1906 but were represented in the Second Duma February?June 1907 With the SRs they held 83 seats The Second Duma was dissolved on the pretext of the discovery of an SD conspiracy to subvert the army Under new electoral laws the SD presence in the Third Duma 1907?12 was reduced to 19 From the Fourth Duma 1912?17 the SDs were finally and fully split The Mensheviks had five members in the Duma and the Bolsheviks had seven including Roman Malinovsky who was later uncovered as an Okhrana agent From 1912 onwards the Bolshevik faction was officially a separate party known as the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party bolshevik The Bolsheviks seized power during the October Revolution in 1917 and in 1918 changed their name to the All- Russian Communist Party They banned the Mensheviks after the Kronstadt Uprising of 1921
In Estonia
In 1902 the Tallinn organisation of the RSDLP was founded which in 1904 was converted into the Tallinn Committee of the party In November a parallel that is also directly under the CC of RSDLP Narva Committee was created Amongst other radicals the Estonian RSDLP cadres were active in the 1905 revolution
At the conference of the Estonian RSDLP organisations in Terijoki Finland in March 1907 the Bolshevik supporters came into serious conflict with the Mensheviks
In Latvia
At the Fourth Unity Congress of the RSDLP in 1906 the Latvian Social Democratic Workers Party entered the RSDLP as a territorial organisation After the congress its name was changed Social-Democracy of the Latvian Territory

L'Ora

L'Ora English The Hour was an Sicilian daily newspaper published in Palermo The paper was founded in 1900 and stopped being published in 1992 In the 1950s-1980s the paper was known for its investigative reporting about the Sicilian Mafia
Foundation
The paper was founded on the initiative of the entrepreneurial Florio family from Palermo with interests in shipping shipbuilding trade and wine industry fisheries mining metallurgy and ceramics The first issue was published on April 22 1900 The formal owner was Carlo Di Rudini the son of the former prime minister of Italy Antonio Di Rudini but the main shareholder and financier was Ignazio Florio
The political direction of the newspaper was generally republican and progressive representing the Sicilian entrepreneurial middle class After the First World War the editorial line turned against the rise of fascism In November 1926 in the aftermath of the failed attack against Benito Mussolini in Bologna the paper was suppressed along with other anti-Fascist newspapers
L'Ora reappeared in January 1927 under the direction of Nicola Pascazio a man close to the Fascist regime former editor of the Il Popolo d'Italia People of Italy the organ of the National Fascist Party with the subtitle fascist newspaper of the Mediterranean The Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 resulted in the suspension of the newspaper but publishing resumed on April 8 1946
The paper changed ownership several times In 1954 the widow of the last owner sold the newspaper to the GATE company which was owned by the Italian Communist Party Partito Comunista Italiano ? PCI and directed by Amerigo Terenzi already in charge of the newspaper Paese Sera
Golden years
Under the new ownership the newspaper enjoyed its golden years under the editor-in-chief Vittorio Nistico who directed the paper between 1954-1975 In this period the journal developed into a newspaper that published many investigative reports about the Sicilian Mafia in an era that the organisation was hardly mentioned
In 1958 L'Ora published a series of investigative reports about the rise of Mafia boss Luciano Leggio in Corleone after the killing of the previous boss Michele Navarra in August 1958 by reporters Felice Chilanti Mario Farinella Enzo Lucchi Michele Pantaleone Castrense Dado and Enzo Perrone The retaliation of Leggio was swift at 4:52 a.m on October 19 1958 a bomb of five kilos TNT exploded in front the newspaper office blowing up half the printing press Two days later the paper appeared again the front-page headline read The mafia threatens us the investigation continues see Infobox
The price of the journal's civic engagement was the killing of three of its journalists The first was Cosimo Cristina who was killed on May 5 1960 investigating the Mafia in the area of Termini Imerese Next was Mauro De Mauro who disappeared on September 16 1970 investigating the involvement of the Mafia with the death of Eni president Enrico Mattei And finally Giovanni Spampinato who was killed on October 27 1972 while looking into the activities of neo-fascism in Sicily and Mafia smuggling activities along the east coast of Sicily
Decline
In the 1970s the newspaper started to have financial problems As an afternoon paper it was more vulnerable to the competition of TV news than its main competitor the Giornale di Sicilia The paper also lost support of the PCI that decided to concentrate on its main publication L'Unita in combination with the historic compromise trying to accommodate the Christian Democrats DC
Although L'Ora changed to publish as a morning newspaper in 1976 the costs that this entailed proved to be excessive and in 1979 the PCI decided the closure of the newspaper L'Ora however refused to die a cooperative of journalists and administrators got the right to use the title and the property while a cooperative of workers got the use of the equipment under the same conditions The measures were taken in the hope of acquiring financial and editorial independence Nevertheless by 1980 the Giornale di Sicilia managed to take advantage of the papers weakened position and demoralized staff to lure away four of its younger and promising reporters Roberto Ciuno Francesco La Licata Daniele Billiteri and Franco Nicastro to form a new crime staff which competed with L'Ora on one of its main news subjects
From the economic point of view the journal was kept alive thanks to the NEM Nuova Editrice Meridionale a company formed by the cooperatives in agreement with the Communist Party which owned the title and the equipment Despite the fact that the technological upgrading and renovation of the headquarters in Palermo was successful editorial and managerial problems led to a lack of adequate leadership Although the paper enjoyed a revival of sales in 1992 this did not prevent the PDS Partito Democratico della Sinistra - Democratic Party of the Left the successor of the PCI to liquidate L'Ora The last issue was published on May 8 1992

Morton Engineering and Dry Dock Company

Morton Engineering and Dry Dock Company was a shipbuilding company from Quebec City Quebec It was located in the Lower Town area of the city along the Saint-Charles River Founded in 1858 the shipyard stayed in operation until 1949 when it constructed its last ship It built ships for the Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy during both world wars
History
Founded by Alex Mackay & Company in 1858 the shipyard was leased to Quebec Shipbuilding & Repairing Company during the First World War The Royal Navy ordered two wooden freighters to be built at the shipyard during the war both completed in 1918
Between the wars the shipyard changed hands In 1919 it was purchased by W.J Morton who changed the name of the shipyard to Quebec Docking & Ship Repairing Company in 1927 after incorporating it In 1928 he changed it again giving it its more well known name Morton Engineering and Dry Dock Company As part of his intention to make the yard bigger he had a 2 500 ton marine railway installed Following the installation the shipyard offered ship repair boiler making and general engineering services In 1937 the shipyard received its first Royal Canadian Navy contract when a minesweeper was ordered for construction
During the Second World War Morton Engineering constructed corvettes and frigates for the Royal and Royal Canadian Navies as part of the convoy escort construction programmes This included some corvettes that were later transferred to the United States In 1941 the St Lawrence During the war the yard employed 2700 workers at its peak This was beyond the capability of the yard's management and in 1943 the Canadian Government took over running the yard and operated it until the end of the war The Morton yard was partnered with the George T Davie & Sons Ltd shipyard at Lauzon and the two operated a joint fitting out yard located in the Louise Basin This was due to hull construction outpacing the fitting out of ships This would lead to labour strife and in June 1943 a strike by the workers at the shipyards would slow production Following this the two yards were expropriated by the Canadian government and placed under the umbrella company Quebec Shipyards Limited and remained under its control until the end of the war
The yard was sold to Herve Baribeau in 1946 renamed St Lawrence Metal and Marine Works Ltd Following the war it built cargo ships The yard closed its doors in 1949
Yard Limitations
The site of the yard limited its ability to launch larger ships It was only the installation of the marine railway that allowed the shipyard to launch modern ships The ships were pulled sideways from launching ways on the west side of the river onto a railway cradle and from there were lowered into the water Canadian winters prevented the launching of ships from December to March
To improve the yard's capability in building and launching large cargo ships during the Second World War the river upstream from Morton Engineering was dredged in order to give room for newly launched larger cargo ships space to turn around It was also dredged downstream in order to connect it to a channel that was navigable

Transportation Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act 2015

The Transportation Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act 2015 or THUD is an appropriations bill that would provide funding for the United States Department of Transportation and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD for fiscal year 2015
The bill was introduced and passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress It was the fourth fiscal year 2015 appropriations bill to pass
Background
An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates gives to sets aside for money to specific federal government departments agencies and programs The money provides funding for operations personnel equipment and activities Regular appropriations bills are passed annually with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year The Transportation Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act 2015 is an example of a regular appropriations bill
Appropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal congressional budget resolutions and the 302(b allocation The U.S Constitution Article I section 9 clause 7 states that No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations The President however still has the power to veto appropriations bills
The Transportation Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act 2015 falls under the jurisdiction of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies The bill covers appropriations for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development HUD as well as for a variety of related agencies The House and Senate currently consider appropriations bills simultaneously although originally the House went first The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall
In 2013 Congress was unable to pass all twelve appropriations bills for fiscal year 2014 before October 1 2013 when the new fiscal year This led to the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 The shutdown lasted for 16 days Finally late in the evening of October 16 2013 Congress passed the Continuing Appropriations Act 2014 and the President signed it shortly after midnight on October 17 ending the government shutdown and suspending the debt limit until February 7 2014 In reaction to this situation House Committee on Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers has stated that his goal is to pass all twelve regular appropriations bills for 2015 before Congress has a recess in August because he wants to avoid a similar situation
The fiscal year 2014 THUD bill never received a House floor vote The vote was cancelled at last minute because the Republican leadership had determined that they did not have enough votes to pass the bill due to the objections of some Republicans to spending cuts in the bill
Major provisions
The bill would appropriate $17 billion to the Department of Transportation and $40.3 billion to the Department of Housing and Urban Development It would spend $1.8 billion less than in fiscal year 2014

Hannover Greif

The Akaflieg Hannover H.2 Greif was a 1922 development of the successful Vampyr glider Though it flew in three successive Rhon Wasserkuppe contests it failed to match the achievements of its predecessor
Design and development
The first Akaflieg Hannover glider was the Vampyr monoplane which flew successfully at the first Rhon contest in 1921 and was probably the first heavier than air machine to used stressed skin construction The Greif was a development of the Vampyr sharing its high thick wing short fuselage configuration and retaining its tail though both wing and fuselage were new
The Greif's wing was a cantilever three part structure mounted on top of the fuselage It had a short rectangular centre section only wide and was entirely plywood covered Outboard the wings were straight tapered with sweep only on the trailing edge Each part was built around a single main spar located at one third chord and swept slightly forward in the outer panels there was an auxiliary spar in the centre section but not elsewhere Beyond the centre section for a little over half the span plywood skin from the spar around the leading edge formed a torsion resistant box Behind the spar the wing was fabric covered as was all of the outer half apart from ply strengthening of the extreme tips Lateral control was by wing warping rather than the ailerons initially fitted to the Vampyr
The Vampyr had a fuselage with a simple rectangular cross-section but that of the Greif was more refined with an elliptical section though both were rather similar in profile Both fuselages were completely ply skinned over wooden bulkheads and stringers The Greif's wing was mounted closer to the fuselage than on its predecessor with the consequence that a cut-out had to be made in the leading edge for the pilot's head This turned out to have deleterious aerodynamic effects Its undercarriage consisted of a pair of semi-recessed wheels with balloon tyres on the centreline one under the nose and the other larger one under the wing spar The tail surfaces of the Greif were very similar to those of the Vampyr a rectangular all-moving tailplane was hinged at the extreme rear of the fuselage with the rudder hinged at the same point The fin was broad as required by the short fuselage fin and rudder had straight vertical edges and a straight rising top The bottom of the rudder was parallel with its top leaving room the tailplane movement
Operational history
Both the Vampire and the Greif flew at the 3rd Rhon contests in the summer of 1922 It was expected than the Greif would out-perform the older Vampyr but despite encouraging early trials it did not on the same day and under similar conditions the Vampyr flew for over three hours but the Greif could only manage 26 minutes The cut-out in the leading edge for the pilot seems to have greatly increased the induced drag the losses were much greater than those caused by similar sized trailing edge cut-outs on other designs as the pressure differences between upper and lower surfaces and the strength of the associated lossy vortexes are smaller there
Nevertheless the Greif competed at the next two Rhons becoming well known though without distinction By 1923 the horizontal tail had been modified to a fixed tailplane and elevator configuration Its last flight at the Zugspitze competition in January 1925 ended with a collision into a wooden fence on landing in Garmisch-Partenkirchen that destroyed the Greif

Boxing
January 31 1954 Upper East Tennessee Golden Gloves bouts are history but the drama and excitement of the three nights that saw some 3,500 fans to crowd into the Park and Recreation building to see the bouts will live on for many moon The final night was one of packed tension with some fireworks that weren't even on the 25-cent program put out by the sponsors But the sum total of it all was that the best golden gloves program ever staged in upper East Tennessee was chalked off precision-like by Tourney director Howard Johnson and commissioner William A Bill Pike of Elizabethton The fun was increasing in intensity over the first two nights that also produced quick action When balding 41 year old Alfred Wheelock entered the ring for the final bout on the golden gloves card some of the doubters shook their heads When it was over the same crowd was admitting life begins at 40 Wheelock who hadn't fought in over 15 years put on an amazing display of fisticuffs that gave Elizabethton's own Billy Ray Morris Plenty of trouble His classic remark was that one of Morris blows shook my toe nails will go down in Golden Gloves history as the remark of a sturdy fighter who knew what he could do at 41 and acknowledged readily what a much younger fighter could do Alfred lost the bout by a split decision

2014?15 Top 14 season

The 2014?15 Top 14 competition is a French domestic rugby union club competition operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby LNR Two new teams from the 2013?14 Pro D2 season were promoted to Top 14 this year Lyon and La Rochelle in place of the two relegated teams Perpignan and Biarritz Olympique Home-and-away play began on 16 August 2014 and will continue through to 23 May 2015 This will be followed by a playoff stage involving the top six teams culminating in the final on 13 June 2015
Competition format
The top six teams at the end of the regular season after all the teams played one another twice once at home once away enter a knockout stage to decide the Champions of France This consists of three rounds the teams finishing third to sixth in the table play quarter-finals hosted by the third and fourth placed teams The winners then face the top two teams in the semi-finals with the winners meeting in the final at Stade de France
The LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions It trialled a new system in 2007?08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons
France's bonus point system operates as follows
Relegation
Normally the teams that finish in 13th and 14th places in the table are relegated to Pro D2 at the end of the season In certain circumstances financial reasons may cause a higher placed team to be demoted instead This last happened at the end of the 2009?10 season when 12th place Montauban were relegated thereby reprieving 13th place Bayonne

Award criteria
The Transkei Defence Force Medal was instituted by the State President to be awarded to all ranks as a military merit medal While the medal is known to have been instituted and likely awarded no warrant has yet been traced and as a result the date of institution is not known
Order of precedence
Since the Transkei Defence Force Medal was authorised for wear by one of the statutory forces that came to be part of the South African National Defence Force on 27 April 1994 it was accorded a position in the official South African order of precedence on that date The order of precedence was revised in April 1996 when decorations and medals were belatedly instituted for the two former non-statutory forces the Azanian People's Liberation Army and Umkhonto we Sizwe
The position of the Transkei Defence Force Medal in the order of precedence remained unchanged as it was in April 1996 when a new series of military orders decorations and medals was instituted in South Africa on 27 April 2003
Description
The Transkei Defence Force Medal is a medallion struck in nickel-silver 38 millimetres in diameter and 3 millimetres thick at the rim displaying the official emblem of the Transkei Defence Force
The reverse displays the Coat of Arms of the Republic of Transkei with the words TRANSKEI DEFENCE FORCE MEDAL around the perimeter above
The ribbon is 32 millimetres wide with a 4 millimetres wide red band and a 4 millimetres wide white band repeated in reverse order and separated by a 16 millimetres wide dark blue band
Discontinuation
Conferment of the Transkei Defence Force Medal was discontinued when the Republic of Transkei ceased to exist on 27 April 1994


Nayda Collazo-Llorens

Nayda Collazo-Llorens born 1968 San Juan PR is a visual artist whose work spans drawing painting printmaking installation video and public art Her work combines images sound and text to investigate how the mind processes information While themes of displacement alienation and synchronicity permeate her videos and interventions her most recent text-based works explore post-alphabetic communication hyperconnectivity and ÅgnoiseÅh as systems of information Collazo-Llorens is the granddaughter of the Puerto Rican literary critic linguist and lexicographer Washington Llorens Though born and raised in Puerto Rico she attended college and graduate school in the United States receiving her BFA in printmaking and graphic design from the Massachusetts College of Art in 1990 and her MFA from New York University in 2002 She has taught at Indiana University of Pennsylvania Carnegie Mellon University School of Art Kalamazoo College and from fall 2014 holds the position of Stuart and Barbara Padnos Distinguished Artist in Residence at Grand Valley State University
Early work influences and context
Collazo-Llorens is a member of a generation of artists who critic Manuel Alvarez Lezama has dubbed ÅgLos NovisimosÅh ? ÅgThe Newest OnesÅh ? which he defines as Puerto Rican artists coming of artistic age in the 1990s responsible for an infusion of provocative contemporary art into the Puerto Rican art scene The artists of ÅgLos NovisimosÅh ? including Allora & Calzadilla Fernando Colon Gonzalez Yvelisse Jimenez Arnaldo Morales and Miguel Trelles ? often use mapping terminology such as the metaphor of the Ågaxis,Åh discussed by key Latin American cultural critics such as Monica Amor Guillermo Gomez-Pena and Gerardo Mosquera among others Curator Silvia Karman Cubina sees the work of this generation of artists as neo-conceptual Ågin which object and content are mutually dependent.Åh For her Ågthese artists navigate issues of identity displacement and politics but contrary to Rican artists of previous generations they do so without nostalgia or resistance.Åh Holland Cotter speaking of Collazo-Llorens's participation in the exhibition None of the Above Contemporary Work by Puerto Rican Artists at Real Art Ways in Hartford Connecticut writes the diaspora phenomenon has become the basis for a new kind of identity politics The art it produces is internationalist in style embracing photography video and installation and tends to hold what might be called indigenous culture at a wry arm's length in some cases bypassing it
Collazo-Llorens adheres to the notion of non-linear narratives as in the writing of such authors as Julio Cortazar Mark Z Danielewski and Don Delillo as well as to theories of perception ? based on the dislocation of time and place through travel ? espoused by Wolfgang Schivelbusch and Mitchell Schwarzer Her interest in the non-hierarchical rhizomatic arrangement of data is reflective of Deleuze and GuattariÅfs emphasis on the nomadic nature of knowledge ÅgTo be rhizomorphous is to produce stems and filaments that seem to be roots or better yet connect with them by penetrating the trunk but put them to strange new uses.Åh It is these Ågstrange new usesÅh that infiltrate an art derived from her bifurcated existence between Puerto Rico and the United States She takes the language of cartography ? part of her familial as well as artistic environment ? and links it to digital communication and code-switching the splicing of Spanish and English working it through intersections that are both systematic and random replete with directed thought and disconnected noise ÅgCollazo-Llorens builds a text of alienation ? of being alien,Åh writes art critic and theorist Kathleen MacQueen Ågas an existential process of identifying what it means to be human.Åh
Works on paper and canvas
An accomplished printmaker Collazo-Llorens is according to curator Deborah Cullen Åga sophisticated draftsperson whoÅchas been producing personal visceral drawings on a daily basis over several years Small but intensely powerful they are compact expressionistic worlds comfortable simultaneously in the language of the bodily and the schematic.Åh Curator Laura Roulet sees Collazo-LlorensÅfs paintings as revealing Åga post-minimalist aesthetic with the systematic organization of Hanne Darboven or Eva Hesse and the calligraphic mark making and erasures of Cy Twombly or Brice Marden.Åh The methodology of these subjective and intimate drawings broadens into expansive mappings either on canvas or directly on the wall Since 2012 her on-going Test series consist of map-like structures that function as systems of visual information while marks can be ÅgreadÅh as hyperlinked terrains or mindscapes MacQueen sees Ågthis unfolding of space between geographical coordinates an exposure of the vectors that chart personal experience.Åh
Video and installation
For Collazo-Llorens drawing does not remain confined to or isolated by the sheet of paper or canvas but merges with mixed media and video into elaborate installations Cullen understands Collazo-LlorensÅfs installation work as a Åg"Gesamtkunstwerk or total work in which all the individual pieces of the project relate to and amplify one another.Åh In her Unfolding the Triangle ? a series of three separate installations representing different geographical areas created in 2009 2011 and 2012 ? Ågdirectional lines numerical symbols and words activate the space and engage the visitor in the unfolding a situational mapping in which the viewer collaborates in ÅereadingÅf the physical installation space.Åh
Unfolding the Triangle ? Lake Michigan 2012 was included in a major solo exhibition of the artistÅfs work at the Richmond Center for Visual Arts Kalamazoo Michigan entitled An Exercise in Numbness and Other Tales Also included was an installation reflecting both the tradition of monumental history painting and media billboard display ? Comfortably Numb 2012 ? an archive of over 1,500 framed images collected from magazines and newspapers Virginia Harbin appreciates this work as Åga collection not of hierarchical information but rather an experiential archive of the everyday.Åh Though the work references obsolete technology it also intimates the barrage of images and words Ågthat comes through our digital devices constantly pushing information,Åh which is understood by the artist as being responsible for an increasingly fragmented and dissociated existence In her video work she expresses these ideas through non-linear means for example in Reverb a 2012 site-specific video installation for Medios y Ambientes Museo Universitario del Chopo in Mexico City Ågthe idea of the loop is taken further by the fact that there are multiple video loops of different lengths that are engaged by the installationÅfs video feedback This effect repeats the video images exponentially and infinitelyÅcthese repetitions layer and decay with every loop to the point of being un-viewable/unreadable.Åh
Interventions and public art
Nayda Collazo-Llorens worked as studio assistant to the conceptual artist Antoni Muntadas from 2001 until 2006 His interest in the relationship between public and private space and the ways in which channels of information are used to censor or promulgate ideas influenced the direction Collazo-Llorens would take her own work but while Muntadas addresses social and political communication Collazo-Llorens Ågprobes the personal processes of seeing remembering and communicating.Åh Though much of the artistÅfs work considers the indiscriminate assortment of thought memory and data within a technological society not all of it is existentially nihilistic Recent work includes a temporary textual intervention on the paths of the Miami Beach Botanical Gardens based on testimonies collected from Miami Beach locals and visitors Commissioned by the Bass Museum of Art Pleasure Fear and the Pursuit of Happiness 2013 marks the pathways with dozens of colorful round text decals The narrative of these ÅgsampledÅh words and phrases serves more as a trigger for new thought than as a reservoir of random recollections Wave / Onda 2004 to 2010 is the artistÅfs first permanent public art installation Created in collaboration with Toro Ferrer Architects for the University of Puerto RicoÅfs General Studies building it uses color to evoke a series of waves crossing the buildingÅfs facade Ågformally organizing this once haphazard access to the university grounds.Åh
Revolu*tion is a site-specific text-based work on the facade of a chapel in San Juan commissioned for the 3rd Poly/Graphic Triennial It is solely composed of found text arbitrarily selected from Internet sites that cover the wall in what MacQueen refers to as Åga turbulence of conflicting verbal conditions.Åh Cullen finds language to be Åga critical element in her works shifts easily between Spanish and English and incorporates counterpoints that range from diaristic poetic snippets to snatches from advertising signage or the news.Åh The context of her work writes MacQueen Ågis the human psyche disparate and unknowable yet manifest in the actions we undertake.Åh Whether through visual or textual signs throughout her work there is a consistent emphasis on the relation between perception and the technological environment and its impact on human relations ÅgIÅfm neither critiquing technology nor supporting it,Åh says the artist Ågrather exploring the contemporary reality it has produced.Åh
Recognition
In 2014 Collazo-Llorens was recognized with a fellowship from the Arcus Center for Social Justice Leadership to undertake practice-based research resulting in a temporary site-specific text-based wall installation for the newly completed ACSJ It featured a collection of sampled text appearing to enter the building through the windows as if voices from the community?often unheard marginalized unaddressed or ignored?were inflowing into this space dedicated to social justice She also received a grant from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation whose program has provided since 1985 Ågassistance to individual visual artists of established ability In 2010 she received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Oficina Apoyo a las Artes y al Quehacer Cultural Instituto de Cultura Puertorriquena San Juan Puerto Rico

Flag of La Rioja

The flag of La Rioja is one of the symbols of the autonomous community of La Rioja It was sanctioned for use by the former governing body of the provincial council for what was then known as the Province of Logrono in 1979 and it appears in the Statute of Autonomy of La Rioja of 1982 which specifies that the flag consist of four horizontal bands of equal size with the colors of red white green and yellow
In addition and similar to the Flag of Spain a coat of arms can be featured in the center of the flag specifically the coat of arms of La Rioja and its use is mandatory for official bodies and entities It is considered along with the coat of arms of La Rioja and La RiojaÅfs anthem one of the Ågsymbols of Riojan identity.Åh
History
Plebiscite
Once the provincial council declared its intent to take procedural steps towards regional autonomy in June 1977 it opened a forum whereby the Riojan population could send its suggestions for the creation of a flag The local newspapers -"La Gaceta del Norte among others- became interested in the idea and started a campaign from June to July 1977 to popularize the idea Riojan politicians considered the proposal one of low priority or one that was premature Of the 260 proposals that were received eleven were pre-selected on the advice of the vexillologist Vicente de Cadenas y Vicent On August 5 1977 a general assembly was celebrated and five of these eleven proposals were submitted for a popular vote
Between September 1 and 15 1977 a plebiscite was carried out and directed by Felipe Abad Leon the official chronicler Between 15,000 and 20,000 votes were submitted Despite these efforts the process went nowhere Opinions and declarations that maintained that it was too early or too inappropriate to approve a flag won out the process was stalled in part by the president of the provincial council Julio Luis Fernandez Sevilla After this failed attempt the question of adopting a flag was forgotten by politicians
Popular movements
By the spring of 1977 the group of university students in Madrid known as the Colectivo Riojano had requested a flag design from the heraldic expert Jose Maria Oria de Rueda who created various designs employing the five colors of the Riojan coat-of-arms red white green yellow and blue
The designs were put to a vote in September 1977 and although a flag choice was not finalized by the vote the process did popularize the issue which became an issue for the general public rather than just for politicians The design that did win was one of Oria de RuedaÅfs but it was not officially adopted by the government
During the Week of La Rioja in Madrid November 1977 organized by Colectivo Riojano a flag was created painted with a spray can with four colors white positioned vertically and red green and yellow horizontally Subsequently in spring of 1978 the Colectivo Riojano also distributed some oval-shaped stickers with a four-colored design which acquired its present form In the same year this flag began to appear in festivals in various towns even though it lacked official sanction It appeared for example in the revived street party of San Juan in Arnedo where it appeared for the first time atop the Pena Lubumbas
A major impetus for the flagÅfs adoption was its use during the celebration known as I Dia de La Rioja celebrated in Najera in October 1978 From that point on various regional collectives adopted the flag for their use In January 1979 some townspeople from Haro asked their mayor to fly the flag from the town hall as other town halls already were flying it The association Amigos de La Rioja sent a letter to the president of the provincial council asking that the flag fly from the Provincial Palace Palacio de la Diputacion
The flag already known by this time as the cuatricolor was flying from various corners of La Rioja and in many flag designs the red colored part of the flag acquired a reddish color tone approaching that of the color of red wine
In May 1979 the flag flew from Mount Laturce during the celebrations of the Dia de Clavijo
Official sanction
Pressure from the public as well as the support given by city councils across La Rioja led to the flag being officially approved by the Riojan government In August 1979 an inquiry on the flag was sent out to the city councils across the region with the result that 115 approved of the flag 51 abstained and 8 were against it
On August 14 1979 a plenary meeting of the Provincial Council finally approved the flag with 17 votes for the flag by the political parties UCD and PSOE the abstention of the Coalicion Democratica 7 members On September 15 at the festival of Our Lady of Valvanera the cuatricolor flew for the first time from the balcony of the Regional Council
Subsequently with the creation of the autonomous community of La Rioja the flag was designated as one of the symbols of Riojan identity
Colors
Tones
The colors of the flag are defined in the statute simply as Ågred white green and yellow,Åh without further specifications In 1985 the specific tones and usage were detailed in the Programa de Identidad Corporativa This specified the following
However in 2003 a new manual on the specifications was issued by the government of La Rioja
This specified the following
The manual explained that these specifications were an adaptation not a dramatic substitution and that the changes in Pantone specifications were meant to be made gradually
Symbolism
The meaning of the flagÅfs colors is variously interpreted depending on the source but the interpretation given in the official act of approval of the flag was
The official meaning of the colors is given as
The four colors appear along with blue in the coat-of-arms of the regional council
Use
Statute 4/May 31 1985 details in Title 1 Articles 3 4 and 5 the correct usage of the Riojan flag
If there are an odd number of flags flying the placement of the Riojan flag would be to the left of the Spanish flag ?to the left as one looks at it If there is an even number of flags flying the position of the Riojan flag would be to the right of the Spanish flag as one looks at it The size of the flag of La Rioja cannot be bigger than that of Spain and it cannot be smaller than the size of other flags when shown or flown together
Article 10 states that the flag cannot be used as the principal symbol for any political party union business association private entity or person Its use on commercial packaging and products requires authorization from the government of La Rioja


Peaceful Evolution theory

The Peaceful Evolution theory in international political thought refers to the alleged attempt to effect a political transformation of the Chinese socialist system by peaceful means primarily by the United States
The phrase was formulated by John Foster Dulles former United States Secretary of State during the Cold War in the 1950s chiefly in the context of the Soviet Union but has not subsequently featured in official discussions of U.S China policy Chinese analyses of U.S foreign policy however hold that it has constituted part of the theoretical foundation for the United States relations with the People's Republic of China since then
According to the thesis the United States maintains a strategy to infiltrate and subvert socialist countries notably China by spreading Western political ideas and lifestyles inciting discontent and encouraging groups to challenge the Party leadership The hoped for aim of this process according to Chinese readings of the alleged policy is that the socialist system is transformed from within
The Communist Party of China CPC has resisted against the idea of Peaceful Evolution beginning when the idea was first raised in the Mao era The Party sees such a process as the biggest threat to its continuous rule because nothing is more important for the Party than the preservation of its rule
Successive generations of CPC leaders have struggled against the Peaceful Evolution theory including Mao Zedong Deng Xiaoping Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin The theory is not currently part of the United States official policy approach to the PRC but communist military strategists consider it a cause of ongoing concern
Origins
The precise locution peaceful evolution was a modification by John Foster Dulles of the doctrine originally outlined by George F Kennan who in his Long Telegram of February 22 1946 proposed that the socialist and capitalist blocs could reach a state of peaceful coexistence
This was augmented by Dulles over a decade later in speeches of 1957-58 to promoting peaceful evolution towards democracy
In a speech Dulles referred to the use of peaceful means to accelerate the evolution of government policies within the Sino-Soviet bloc in order to shorten the expected life span of communism Western assistance and commerce were said to be two of the chief instruments of this plan to create a more liberal government in China
According to Bo Yibo father of ousted Politburo member Bo Xilai Mao Zedong heard about Dulles's remarks and took them seriously ordering top Party cadres to study the speeches Mao saw the idea of Peaceful Evolution as a serious policy threat a much more deceptive tactic to corrupt China and a war against the socialist powers by military means Mao felt that the war already being waged with some effect against the Soviet Union After the collapse of the Soviet Union the Chinese communists became more concerned about the strategy
Uses of the term
The term Peaceful Evolution has been used in the context of China and modernization outside the sphere of international relations Scholars of China's media environment have used it to refer to the marketization of the press in China where state control by the Communist Party lessons while the forces of commercialization take hold?though whether the media sphere in China has really evolved along such lines is disputed
While Peaceful Evolution ideas are often attributed to the foes of China observers have suggested that some officials in the Chinese communist system?such as Wen Jiabao?support the process These allegedly reform-oriented officials however are not considered part of the Communist Party's mainstream
Scholars have argued that the typical Chinese uses of the term?as a conspiratorial plot?are too vague and all embracing its meaning ranges from dark conspiracies involving the alleged plotters of the counter revolutionary rebellion reference to the Tiananmen Square massacre to the broad spectrum of cultural social and economic exchanges with the outside world
The overall utility of the term for Chinese analysts is that it sums up a range of the threats to the regime's political security faced by the Party in the post-Cold War era These threats are mostly connected with the United States and are seen as part of the United State's own foreign policy after the collapse of the Soviet Union
However the term is now often used by Chinese scholars to condemn any foreign activities including cultural economic social that are seen as problematic for the Communist Party?not just those that are actually intended to undermine it It is also used to dismiss out of hand United States criticism on the Chinese government's human rights record on the theory that the West is simply attempting to undermine the Chinese people's respect for the Communist Party
Post-Tiananmen Massacre
Chinese sensitivities to the idea of a Peaceful Evolution strategy by foreign powers were heightened by the post-Tiananmen crackdown climate of 1989 and the series of regime collapses in Eastern Europe during that year Initially Chinese communist leaders had determined the regime changes in the European countries as an internal affair In their own meetings however they declared them a matter of foreign subversion also known as peaceful evolution
Wang Zhen sought to arm Chinese troops with the ideological shield to guard against Western idea?while on a military inspection tour of Xinjiang he said unswervingly follow the socialist road the road may be winding and the struggle fierce In our opposition to peaceful evolution a key tenet is to fortify the brains of the entire party with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought Jiang Zemin the Party leader after June 4 said that peaceful evolution posed major danger for communist countries
A three-part article was published in People's Daily after the massacre titled On Peaceful Evolution It argued that the collapse of communist regimes in Europe were a result of bourgeois liberalization which refers to Peaceful Evolution and that the democracy protests in China had also been an attempt to negate party leadership by political pluralism and negate public ownership in the economy by privatization The CPC's crackdown was able to crush the peaceful evolution strategy of the imperialists according to scholar Jialin Zhang
Perceptions in China
Among state-affiliated intellectuals and strategists in the PRC the term and theory of Peaceful Evolution is a threat and an attempt to undermine the Communist Party's rule The hard line scholar Huo Shiliang of the Chinese Academy of Social Science's says that after Dulles the Americans policy of attempting to peaceful transform China has simply accelerated
Before June 4 China considered the United States as a trustworthy and friendly country but since June 4 the United States has become the main source of instability in China Peaceful evolution is the main threat to China's stability today The ideological struggle will be the most important factor in future Sino-American relations The U.S will again become the major threat to China but not a military one The Taiwan problem will remain important but the ideological struggle?particularly peaceful evolution?will be primary
The theory of Peaceful Evolution is a key part of Chinese official assessments of the collapse of the Soviet Union In bracing themselves against the Americans soft power approaches and attempts to undermine the regime they have advocated a series of countermeasures According to Li Jingjie the director of the former Soviet-Eastern Europe Institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences there are eight lessons that China must draw from the Soviet collapse due in part to the infiltration of Peaceful Evolution

H.R 3786 113th Congress

The bill is a bill that would allow the federal government to sell nine acres of land and the building on it to the city of Anchorage Alaska The land is currently owned and used by the National Archives and Records Administration to store ongoing federal records and Alaska records dating back to its purchase in 1867
The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress
Background
The records available at the archives include textual documents architectural drawings maps photographs and microfilm and had not been cataloged
Provisions of the bill
This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service a public domain source
The bill would direct the Administrator of the General Services Administration GSA on behalf of the Archivist of the United States to convey to the City of Anchorage Alaska property in such city consisting of approximately nine acres and improvements located at 400 East Fortieth Street for not less than fair market value The bill would make the net proceeds from such conveyance available to the Archivist to fund repairs and restorations conducted by the National Archives and Records Administration NARA
Congressional Budget Office report
This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office as ordered reported by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on March 13 2014 This is a public domain source
H.R 3786 would authorize the General Services Administration on behalf of the National Archives and Records Administration NARA to sell certain property in Anchorage Alaska for fair market value Proceeds from the sale would be available to be spent by NARA subject to future appropriation
The Congressional Budget Office CBO estimates that enacting this legislation would have no significant effect on the federal budget because we expect that the conveyance of this property will occur under current law Based on information from NARA we expect that the property will be sold over the next ten years because the agency has recently announced plans to close its operating facilities in Alaska Because this legislation would accelerate the process of selling the property the collection of sale proceeds which are offsetting receipts an offset to direct spending also would be accelerated Therefore pay-as-you-go procedures apply However CBO estimates the effect on offsetting receipts over the 2014-2024 period would be negligible Enacting the bill would not affect revenues
H.R 3786 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state local or tribal governments
Procedural history
H.R 3786 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on December 16 2014 by Rep Don Young R AK-0 The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Economic Development Public Buildings and Emergency Management It was reported amended by the Committee on Transportation on April 9 2014 alongside House Report 113-407 The House was scheduled to vote on the bill under a suspension of the rules on June 17 2014
Debate and discussion
One opponent of the bill focused primarily on his opposition to the NARA closing its only facility in Alaska arguing that it is disrespectful of Alaska to attempt to balance the NARA budget by closing the Alaska National Archives facility and selling off the permanent site


Ali-Tegin

Ali ibn Hasan also known as Harun Bughra Khan and better known as Ali-Tegin also spelled Alitigin was a Karakhanid ruler in Transoxiana from 1020 to 1034 with a brief interruption in 1024/5
Biography
Origins
He was the son of Hasan ibn Sulayman Bughra Khan simply called Bughra Khan in Persian sources who was the eponymous ancestor of eastern branch of the Karakhanid family known as the Hasanids which Ali-Tegin belonged to Furthermore Hasan is only known in Persian sources because of his wars with the Iranian Samanids who used to be the rulers of Transoxiana before the Karakhanids under Nasr Khan annexed their territories in 999
Rise to power
Ali-Tegin is first mentioned as being thrown in prison under the orders of his opponent Mansur Arslan Khan but quickly managed to escape and receive help from a group of Oghuz Turks under the Seljuq chief Arslan Isra'il With these Oghuz Turks under his grasp Ali-Tegin seized Bukhara and soon occupied all of Sogdia after his conquest of the region he took the title of Yigan-tigin and another title of Arslan Ilig He then gave his daughter in marriage to Arslan Isra'il With the possession of the wealthy and important cities of Bukhara and Samarkand Ali-Tegin became a powerful and influential figure in Central Asia however this made his relations with his jealous brother Yusuf Qadir Khan hostile and resulted in Qadir Khan allying himself with the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud who had received expression of discontent from Ali-Tegin's subjects and was himself annoyed by Ali-Tegin who did not allow him to send envoys to Qadir Khan whose territories consisted of the important cities of Khotan and Kashgar Ali-Tegin after having received the news of his brother's alliance with the Ghaznavids responded by allying himself with his other brother Muhammad Toghan Khan
Conflict with the Ghaznavids
In 1024/5 a combined army under Mahmud and Qadir Khan invaded Ali-Tegin's territories and completely defeated him and his Seljuq supporters Ali-Tegin then fled to the steppes while Mahmud and Qadir Khan made a marriage alliance at Samarkand Mahmud also managed to take the family of Ali-Tegin captive which was fleeing towards the steppes but was captured by an officer of Mahmud Meanwhile Arslan Isra'il fled to Ghaznavid territory in Khorasan and asked for permission to settle in the region in return for protecting the Ghaznavid borders from incursions by the other Turks of Transoxiana Mahmud who did not trust him had him and his followers imprisoned
Fortunately for Ali-Tegin however Mahmud had to withdraw from Transoxiana in order to prepare another expedition in India which gave Ali-Tegin the opportunity to make a counter-attack against Qadir Khan and re-conquer his former territories Ali-Tegin although not with the support of Arslan Isra'il any longer had support from the latter's nephews Tughril and Chaghri Beg Although Ali-Tegin quarreled with the Seljuqs in 1029 the Seljuqs still continued to serve and support Ali-Tegin
After a brief civil war in the Ghaznavid state in 1030 Mahmud's son Mas'ud I became the ruler of the Ghaznavid Empire and continued his father's behavior of aggression towards Ali-Tegin Mas'ud now began aiming to once and for all conquer Transoxania from Ali-Tegin and to give it to Qadir Khan's second son who was his own brother-in-law Muhammad Bughra Khan In 1032 the Ghaznavid governor of Khwarazm Altun Tash captured Bukhara and a battle was shortly fought at Dabusiyya which became inconclusive Altun Tash died during the battle but one of his most trusted officer Ahmad Shirazi managed to successfully negotiate with Ali-Tegin who agreed to return to Samarkand while the Ghaznavid army withdrew back to their own territories
Meanwhile in Khwarazm Altun-Tash's son Harun became the new ruler of the region However unlike his father he was hostile to the Ghaznavids and in 1034 allied with Ali-Tegin whom he together planned with to invade Khorasan However before the invasion occurred Harun was assassinated by his own slaves whom Mas'ud had persuaded to do so Ali-Tegin shortly died himself during the period but his sons continued to fight the Ghaznavids until some years later when their relative Boritigin also known as Tamghach Khan Ibrahim conquered their territories

Herzegovina Uprising 1852?62

The Herzegovina Uprising ÑVÑuÑÇÑàÑuÑsÑÄÑrÑpÑâÑ{Ñy ÑÖÑÉÑÑÑpÑ~ÑpÑ{ also known as Vukalovi?'s Uprising was an uprising fought by ethnic Serbs in the Herzegovina region against the Ottoman Empire between 1852 and 1862 It was led by chieftain Luka Vukalovi?
Background
After the death of Ali-pa?a Rizvanbegovi? who had made efforts to promote agriculture and recuperate the economy of the Herzegovina Eyalet under his rule the eyalet was abolished and merged into the Bosnia Eyalet
In March 1852 Ottoman general Omar Pasha Omer-pa?a decided to disarm the Herzegovinians which sparked an outrage in the region The chieftain of the Herzegovinians was Luka Vukalovi? The refusal of giving up arms resulted in minor fights between Herzegovinians and Turks local Slavic Muslims which in turn resulted in an uprising which Vukalovi? would lead
Uprising
The uprising began in winter 1852/53 when Grahovo Banjani and Drobnjaci refused to pay the Turks a debt As the actions against Montenegro by the Ottomans began the East Herzegovinian clans fought alongside Montenegrins Although there weren't major actions in the period of 1853?57 there wasnÅft peace Austria evidently interfered in the actions of Vukalovi? as it would help Montenegro and the French consulates followed the uprising The uprising was boosted in December 1857 after Knez Danilo started backing the rebels bitter at the Porte because of its statements in the Paris Congress in 1856
After the Battle of Grahovac on May 1 1858 when Montenegrin and Herzegovinian rebels defeated the Turks Knez Danilo titled Vukalovi? the voivode of Zubac Kru?evica Dra?evica and Sutorina giving him some autonomy
The Porte agreed on appeasement it carried out a border with Montenegro thus recognizing the independence of Montenegro As the great part of East Herzegovina except Grahovo part of Banjani Drobnjaci ?upa and Nik?i? Rudina was left under Ottoman rule Vukalovi? continued the uprising This strongly echoed in Bosnia in particular the revolts in Bosanska Krajina and Posavina in 1858 Afraid that the uprising would spill over in its territory Austria increased its tackling of Vukalovi? helping in different ways even the Turks
Vukalovi? in his requests didn't only deal with economical problems of Herzegovina but marking the fight for national liberation seeking for Herzegovina to join Montenegro This character of uprising sparked the interest of the great powers of Europe whom consulate representatives worked on giving Vukalovi? to the Ottoman government Vukalovi? continued fighting against the Turks and after the violent death of Knez Danilo in 1860 inspired by the unification of Italy which was led by Garibaldi
Since 1861 Omer-pa?a tried in many ways to end the uprising unsuccessfully But when Montenegro after a defeat to the Turk in August 1862 promised that it wouldn't help the rebel movement in Herzegovina Vukalovi? understood this as the people had been strained and then wrote to Omer-pa?a who promised amnesty for all rebels
Aftermath
Omer-pa?a promised Vukalovi? that he would continue his office as voivode of Zubac Kru?evica Dra?evica and Sutorina but this was not held he instead appointed him bimba?a of 500 pandurs who would secure peace along the borders When he saw that the Ottomans didn't give their promises of relief on feudal duties and tax cuts he tried in 1865 to once again start an uprising but without any help was unsuccessful Vukalovi? left his birthplace and migrated to Russia where he died in 1873

Moloch Kuprin

Moloch ÑMÑÄÑ|ÑÄÑá is a short novel by Alexander Kuprin first published in Russkoye Bogatstvo"s December 1896 issue A sharp critique of the rapidly growing Russian capitalism and a reflection of the growing industrial unrest in the country it is considered Kuprin's first major work
Synopsis
Engineer Andrey Bobrov works for a ruthless capitalist industrial enterprise feeling more and more uncomfortable with what is going on around him After losing Nina the woman he loves to the amoral industrialist Kvashnin who owns that enterprise he suffers a nervous breakdown and is left a broken man prone to frenzied and futile debates with his own double The story's finale hints at the outbreak of a workers revolt
Background
According to scholar Nicholas Luker thematically Moloch belongs firmly in the 1890s and reflects many of the social and economic issues of that decade."The second half of the 1800s saw the rapid development of Russian capitalism with its concomitant industrial expansion As her rail network was enlarged and her textile metallurgical and mining industries expanded Russia's output rose steadily The All-Russian Industrial Exhibition of 1896 in Nizhny Novgorod to which Kuprin refers in The Yuzovsky Works was designed to demonstrate the impressive achievements of Russian industry But with the industrial boom came growing unrest among the new working class its ranks swelled by poor peasants driven off the land by such agrarian crises as the famine of 1891-1892 A series of industrial disturbances of the mid-1890s are reflected in the workers revolt at the end of Moloch
History
The story was first published in Russkoye Bogatstvo No 12 December issue In a heavily edited version it appeared in The Stories a 1903 collection published by Gorky's Znaniye The same year it was published by Donskaya Retch The Don Speaking a Rostov-on-Don-based publishing house There the final scene was absent altogether The process of the text's moderation continued while the author was preparing it for Adolf Marks The Complete Kuprin series Judging by the author's letter to Nikolai Mikhaylovsky originally the last chapter looked much more radical than its final version Eventually its tone was considerably toned down according to Mikhaylovsky's recommendations
Submitting the text to the publishers A K Marks Kuprin wrote to Mikhaylovsky Here's Moloch"Åfs 11th chapter I've changed it drastically following your instructions Now I'd like to ask you please - should you find something improper with the text please go through it with your own pen There is one thing I should confess to I've still not managed to avoid morbid psychology Perhaps this unhappy genre is inseparable from me Kuprin apparently planned to finish Moloch with the scene of the workers revolt with Bobrov blowing up the boilers Mikhaylovsky insisted on changing the finale finding it melodramatic This according to Soviet critic I Pitlyar has made the general tone of the novel more pessimistic As Kuprin wrote to Mikhailovsky upon altering his manuscript About the revolt - not a word One will only be able to feel it
Critical reception
Angel Bogdanovich reviewing Kuprin's collection for Znaniye wrote Of the ten pieces included only Moloch the longest one stands out But despite some excellent fragments like the one depicting the factory in general there is some stiltedness in the style as if the author works under some outside influence
According to modern scholar Nicholas Luker The defects of Moloch are several The melodrama of works like In the Dark emerges again especially in the Bobrov-Nina-Kvashnin triangle which bears some resemblance to the earlier Alarin-Zinaida-Kashperov pattern Two sections of Moloch are unashamedly sensational the fevered verbal exchanges between Bobrov and Mme Zinenko at the picnic and the arrival of the hero blood-stained and tattered at the hospital to beg Goldberg for morphia


Mihri Mu?fik Han?m

Princess Mihri Achba Mihri Mu?fik Han?m Mihri Rasim 26 February 1886 - 1954 was the one of the first and renowned Turkish female painter She was the first contemporary female artist to study about paintings She was recognized especially for her portraits She made the portraits of very well-known people including Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and Pope Benedict XV
Biography
Early life
The eccentric and bohemian painter Mihri Mu?fik Han?m was born into the Anchabadze dynasty as an Anchabadze princess in the Rasim Pasha Mansion Baklatarlas? District of Kad?koy on 26 February 1886 Her Abkhazian father Prince Dr Ahmed Rasim Pasha was an anatomy specialist and a preeminent instructor in the Military School of Medicine In formal documents and family letters he is also referred to as the president of this institution Dr Ahmed Rasim Pasha's refined tastes and interest in music painting and in literature must have played an important role in the artistic formation of his daughter In addition to his reputation as a physician Rasim Pasha was also famous for his interest in music and for playing the saz at evening gatherings In these activities he serves as a telling example of the Istanbul elites of the period for displaying as occidental versatility in their lives Mihri Han?m's Abkhazian mother Princess Fatma Ne?edil Han?m was one of Rasim Pasha's wives Her younger sister Enise Han?m was mother to the painter Hale Salih Asaf another distinguished female artist of the late Ottoman society
Departure to Europe
Given a typical western education Mihri Han?m took an interest in literature music and painting Her first private lessons in painting were provided by an Italian Orientalist artist Fausto Zonaro in his studio in the Istanbul quarter of Be?ikta?-Akaretler Mihri Han?m fell in love with the Italian director of an acrobat company visiting Istanbul and subsequently departed for Rome and then Paris evidently wishing to be involved in art circles For a time she lived and worked in a flat in Montparnasse sustaining herself by painting portraits and subletting one of rooms to students One of these tenants was Mu?fik Selami Bey a student of politics at the University of Sorbonne whom she later married Mu?fik Bey was the son of Selami Bey a well-known personage from Bursa He was interested in politics history and literature The date of her marriage with him is unknown
Return to Istanbul
Mihri Han?m was introduced to Cevit Bey Ottoman minister of finance in Paris to arrange an agreement with the French government following the Balkan wars Telegrams send by Cavit Bey to the minister of education recommending Mihri Han?m resulted in her being appointed as an art teacher at the Istanbul Teachers Training School for Girls in 1913 following the appointment of Mufide Kadri and Madame Refael When the School of Fine Arts for Girls was established in 1914 she was hired here as director as well as fine arts instructor following the appointment of mathematician Salih Zeki Bey As we will see Mihri Han?m's contributions to the School of Fine Arts for Girls were considerable even revolutionary
Another early and significant step in women's education was the opening of nursing classes in 1843 Fifteen years later a letter arrived at the Grand Vizirate from the Council of Education stressing that a school for girls was badly needed if leaving girls uneducated was now being viewed as dangerous after a certain age educating them together with males was equally so Thus shortly thereafter in 1859 the first general school for women the Cevri Kalfa School was opened and since women teachers could not be found elderly male instructors were hired to provide training Official journals as well as various other newspapers supported women's education and promoted Cevri Kalfa School Arguments made in favour of it were mostly based on
Edebiyat-? Cedide
Mihri Han?m also had friends among the poets of Edebiyat-? Cedide New Literature especially on of its leaders Tevfik Fikret If the Edebiyat-? Cedide constituted the literary wing of French artistic influence among the late Ottoman intelligentsia Mihri Han?m can be said to represent its counterpart in painting she clearly had a special place among the artists of this school Tevfik Fikret's house in A?iyan became her studio for a time as seen in his notes There is a lady upstairs who paints my portraits She interprets my verses so wonderfully-I am surprised to discover that my words are so meaningful She has begun to describe myself to me How alienated have I become from my writing
Edebiyat-? Cedide poets were influenced by Realism Parnassianism ans Symbolism which dominated nineteenth-century French literature during this period Cenab ?ahabettin a member of Servet-i Funun notes one of its principle conceptions a special relation with nature a place where emotions and dreams roam it was also taken to act as the mirror of the artist's souls In addition to this influence the colour symbolism of Edebiyat-? Cedide poetry seems to have influenced Mihri Han?m's work."Mai ve Siyah and Black Hlit Ziya's famous novel reflects the blues of the Edebiyat-? Cedide school as well as Mihri Han?m's portraits
Mihri Han?m's visit to the journalist Huseyin Cahit Yalc?n and the convicted ex-minister of France Cavit Bey gave rise to criticisms regarding her behaviour In response in 1919 she and her students paid a visit to the newspaper Tanin and denounced the allegations Her close relations with the ?ttihad ve Terraki Cemiyeti Committee of Union and Progress CUP eventually caused Mihri Han?m to leave Istanbul occupied by Allied powers for Italy in 1919 Within a year after her return she resumed teaching at the School of Fine Arts for Girls
Visit to Italy
Toward the end of 1922 she went to Italy again and there ended her marriage with Mu?fik Bey the couple divorced in 1923 She had an affair with the Italian poet Gabriele D'Annunzio and through him found an opportunity to paint a portrait of the pope as well as to work at the restoration of the frescoes in a chapel Mihri Han?m had been introduced to d'Annunzio by her friend painter Renato Brozzi and corresponded with him through Brozzi She was occasionally a topic in their correspondence On 4 February 1926 d'Annunzio wrote to Brozzi Where is the Turkish lady I have been unable to hear from her If you see her embrace her for me but this embrace must be that of harem agha's In another letter written on 26 August 1926 the Turkish lady was once again recalled Where is the odalisque Mihri What is she doing Apparently regardless of Mihri Han?m's struggles as a professional these Italian painters continued to view her through an Orientalist filter
Later years and death
Mihri Han?m returned to Turkey briefly after the foundation of the republic Here she painted Ataturk's portrait and presented it to him personally at the Cankaya Presidential Residence in Ankara
Mihri Han?m subsequently traveled to Rome to Paris and then to America New York Boston Washington and Chicago The details of her departure from Turkey and arrival in America are not certain It is still unclear when she arrived in the country though a news item in the New York Times dated 25 November 1928 notes that a collection of Mihri Han?m's work was to be exhibited at the George Maziroff Gallery between November 26 and December 15 thus indicating that she was in fact in New York after 1928
Between 1938 and 1939 she worked as a protocol hostess at the World Exposition in Long Island New York During this period she painted a portrait of Rezzan Yelman the wife of journalist Ahmet Emin Yalman who lived in New York She also reportedly produced cover illustrations for various journals published in New York during World War II She lived her last years destitute and was sadly buried in a pauper's graveyard in Hart Island New York in 1954


Art Is The Permanent Revolution

Art Is The Permanent Revolution 2012 is a documentary film by Manfred Kirchheimer that explores how politics and the artists of the past have affected the art and process of four artists presented in documentary There are two strands that run in parallel through the film The first is a stream of politically inspired images by famous artists of the past and the second strand consist of interviews with four artists as they produce their politically inspired art The documentary was viewed positively by reviewers
Subject
The film focuses on four American artists as they discuss politics and their creative process As these artists talk and produce their art interspersed are some 400 politically oriented images from some 60 artists such as Rembrandt Honore Daumier George Grosz Frans Masereel Kathe Kollwitz Otto Dix and Francisco Goya
The documentary can be characterized by two parallel lines that converge at the end In the first line there is a near continuous stream of images drawings engravings lithographs etchings and woodcuts by a large number of artists from the past matched by music that expresses their political subject matter The second line consists of interviews with four artists as they practice their art to create a politically inspired product It is not until the end when the creative products of each artist are finished that the two lines of the movie converge in the artistic processes and political perspectives that allow them to create their politically-inspired artistic products
The four artists interviewed during the film are Paul Marcus who is a woodcutter concerned with torture
Sigmund Abeles who is a painter etcher and works on a war-themed etching
Ann Chernow who is a painter lithographer and creates a cemetery concerning oil and war
James Read who is a master print maker who operates a lithography press and who is not that different in many respects from the old-time pressmen and women who worked in the bowels of a largely dying print industry
Critical reception
Rotten Tomatoes reported 100% of the reviewers liked the documentary Writing for the The Village Voice Michelle Orange wrote that taken together in the film these images produced across centuries form a larger contiguous critique of who we are and what we do to one another David Noh writing for Film Journal International states that the entire history of politically inspired printmaking unfolds in Manfred Kirchheimer's admirably serious hands-on documentary
Writing for Time Out Andrew Schenker concludes that Art Is does offer up compelling portraits of practicing artists intelligently probing their status as socially conscious image makers


Battle of Constantinople 1147

The Battle of Constantinople in 1147 was a large-scale clash between the forces of the Byzantine Empire and the German crusaders of the Second Crusade led by Conrad III of Germany near the Byzantine capital Constantinople The Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos was deeply concerned by the presence of a large and unruly army in the immediate vicinity of his capital and of the unfriendly attitude of its leaders Following earlier armed clashes with the crusaders and perceived insults from Conrad Manuel arrayed some of his forces outside the walls of Constantinople A part of the German army then attacked and was heavily defeated Following this defeat the crusaders agreed to be quickly ferried across the Bosporus to Asia Minor
Though limited in its strategic importance the battle is significant in being a rare instance where Byzantine tactical dispositions are described in detail in the primary sources of the period
Background
The Second Crusade 1145?1149 was instigated by Pope Eugenius III in response to the fall of the County of Edessa to the forces of the Muslim leader Zengi The county had been founded during the First Crusade This crusade was the first to be led by kings namely Conrad III of Germany and Louis VII of France The armies of the two kings marched separately across Europe After crossing into Byzantine territory in the Balkans both armies made their way towards the Byzantine capital Constantinople The crusader armies intended to then take the overland route across Asia Minor to reach the Holy Land
Conrad had insulted Manuel by calling him King of the Greeks rather than his formal title of Emperor of the Romans and the imperial pretensions of the Germans made them far more suspect in Byzantine eyes than were the French Following oaths taken by the German leaders that they intended no injury to the Byzantine Empire Manuel made preparations for markets to be made available as the crusader army crossed imperial territory A Byzantine force under the experienced general Prosouch Borsuq who was of Turkish origin shadowed the Germans A minor clash between the Byzantine force and the crusaders occurred near Adrianople with the Byzantines repulsing an attack by Conrad's nephew the future emperor Frederick Barbarossa The crusaders also suffered a natural disaster when part of their encampment was swept away by a flash flood with considerable loss of life
Manuel wished to induce the crusaders to cross to Asia Minor by the Hellespont keeping them away from Constantinople However they ignored the advice of Manuel's ambassador and pushed towards Constantinople arriving on 10 September Manuel had extensively repaired and strengthened the walls of his capital as a safeguard against any crusader aggression The Germans encamped around the suburban palace of Philopation but so pillaged it that it became quickly uninhabitable They then moved to another suburban palace Pikridion The crusader force which may have been suffering from a lack of food made depredations on and acts of violence against the local population Manuel was determined to get the Germans across the Bosporus as quickly as possible and mobilised part of his military forces to induce them to move
Battle
The Byzantine force was placed under the command of two generals Prosouch and Basil Tzikandyles They were instructed to make a stand confronting the Germans and by their presence provoke an attack The Byzantine army was smaller than that of the crusaders but as the contemporary Byzantine historian John Kinnamos states it was equally superior in military science and perseverance in battle Prosouch and Tzikandyles had earlier been sent to observe the German army at a place called Longoi They had reported to the emperor Manuel that although the Germans were individually impressive and well armoured their cavalry was not swift and they lacked discipline
The array of the Byzantine army unusually is described in some detail by Kinnamos To the fore far forward were four units taxiarchiai of the most unwarlike common part of the army Kinnamos wording indicates that these were infantry Behind these were drawn up the heaviest and most well-armoured cavalry the kataphraktoi the elite of the army Next were those who rode swift horses the koursores a more mobile form of close-combat cavalry Finally in the rear were the Cumans Seljuk Turks and the Romans archer force all presumably horse archers This formation is unusual for a pitched battle and is essentially the reverse of standard Byzantine practice as exemplified by the Battle of Sirmium in 1167 At Sirmium the horse archers were thrown forward to skirmish with and provoke the enemy the koursores were placed as flank guards the kataphraktoi were at the front of the main body of the army whilst the infantry were held in reserve in the rear
The Byzantinist John Birkenmeier argues that this array was dictated by the particular circumstances of the battle the Byzantines knew the ground intimately as it was just beyond the walls of Constantinople and were aware of the German dispositions so that they did not need to use their horse archers as a scouting or screening force Indeed the Byzantine array was more like that used by Alexios I Komnenos at the Battle of Philomelion in 1117 where the infantry were used to blunt enemy attacks allowing the cavalry to make controlled counter-attacks from behind the infantry's protective screen In addition the lighter-armed troops by being placed in the rear could both cover a retreat or exploit a victory depending on circumstances
According to Kinnamos that part of the crusading army confronted by the Byzantines was seized by a great eagerness and disorder and attacked at a run A fierce battle developed in response to the reckless attack of the Germans the Byzantines scientifically resisted and slew them A contemporary encomium collection of praise poems addressed to Manuel I describes the Cuman horse archers as playing a notable part in the fighting The Germans suffered heavy casualties It is clear that not all of the German crusading army was involved in the conflict Conrad was with another possibly larger section of the army He appears to have been at a considerable distance from the scene of the action as he did not learn of the reverse that his troops had suffered for some time
Aftermath
The show of military force on the part of the Byzantines persuaded Conrad to accede to Manuel's wishes and have the bulk of his army speedily ferried across the Bosphoros to Damalis Manuel's gravest concern the threat that the German and French crusader armies might combine immediately outside his capital had been averted With the Germans safely on the Asian shore he opened negotiations with Conrad once again Manuel wanted assurances that the Germans would restore to him any land they might conquer that had once been Byzantine but Conrad was reluctant to agree to this Manuel offered Conrad an alliance but was rejected The German crusaders then without active Byzantine guidance or adequate supplies pushed into the interior of Anatolia At Dorylaeum they were met by the Seljuk Turks and as they were half-starving were forced to retreat The Turks punitively harassed the retreating crusaders and the retreat became a rout
Meeting up with the French army at Nicaea the combined crusader force then took the coastal route towards Attaleia Though within nominal Byzantine territory the crusaders continued to be attacked by the Turks who were allegedly aided by the local Greek population From Attaleia Conrad took ship back to Constantinople Manuel received him magnificently and personally gave him medical attention when he fell ill The rapprochement between the two sovereigns was sealed with the negotiation of a dynastic marriage Manuel undertook to ship Conrad's now diminished force to Palestine where the forces of the Second Crusade ultimately met with failure when defeated outside the walls of Damascus


Eureka Road

Eureka Road or Eureka Avenue is a major thoroughfare and section line road in the Downriver region of Metro Detroit in the U.S state of Michigan Though it is almost never referred to as such Eureka Road corresponds to south 9 Mile in Detroit's Mile Road System Detroit
Route description
The road starts out as a residential street at the Detroit River in downtown Wyandotte running west-northwestward A couple blocks later Eureka Road intersects Biddle Avenue turns due west and widens to a major commercial street with four through lanes and a left-turn lane in the center Roosevelt High School is located on Eureka several blocks west of that point Then a couple blocks west of the high school the road sinks below ground level to accommodate five viaducts all built in 1927 the four easternmost viaducts each carry Conrail Shared Assets/Norfolk Southern and Canadian National rail lines and the fifth is currently unused but originally carried Detroit Monroe & Toledo Short Line Railway interurban tracks until that railroad folded in the early 1930s as a result of increasing competition from automobiles as well as the effects of the Great Depression
Eureka Road's prominence continues as the road itself continues westward-both the Southgate Shopping Center and Southland Center are located on Eureka in Southgate and Taylor respectively The original location of the Gibraltar Trade Center is also located on Eureka Road in Taylor
West of Southland Center the suburban sprawl on both sides of Eureka Road decreases as the area becomes more rural This is especially evident in Romulus where the suburban sprawl stops completely just east of Merriman Road at this point Eureka Road becomes a short expressway and briefly curves about a quarter-mile south along the southern edge of Detroit Metro Airport before ultimately becoming a rural two-lane road west of the Interstate 275 I-275 interchange ending shortly thereafter at Huron River Drive
Expressway portion
Eureka Road becomes an expressway from just west of Merriman Road to just west of Wayne Road along the southern edge of Metro Airport in Romulus This includes a trumpet interchange with John D Dingell Drive which is Metro Airport's southern entrance providing access to the airport's McNamara Terminal Eureka Road was first converted to an expressway at this point in the early 1990s and was extended a east from its original terminus halfway between Merriman Road and Dingell Drive in late 2002
Name
Eureka Road took its name from the Eureka Iron Company whose plant was located at the foot of the road at the Detroit River in Wyandotte in the late 19th century The Eureka Iron Company used this road to ship supplies to the plant
Public transportation
Eureka Road is served by portions of a total of three Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation routes all serving Southland Center Route?125 provides half-hour service between M-85 Fort Street and Metro Airport seven days a week Route?160 provides hourly service six days a week between Trenton Road in Southgate and Biddle Avenue in downtown Wyandotte and Route?275 provides weekday rush-hour service along Eureka between Southland Center and U.S Highway?24 US?24 Telegraph Road in Taylor


The Divergent Series

The Divergent Series is a series of science-fiction dystopian action adventure films from Summit Entertainment based on the Divergent novels by the American author Veronica Roth The series is produced by Lucy Fisher Pouya Shabazian and Douglas Wick and stars Shailene Woodley and Theo James as the two leading characters Beatrice Tris Prior and Tobias Four Eaton Two directors have worked on the series Neil Burger directed the first film and Robert Schwentke directed the next two films
The first film Divergent was released on March 21 2014 and grossed over $56 million during its opening weekend ranking it at first place in the domestic and worldwide box-office rankings Since its release the film has grossed over $288 million making it a financial success but received mixed reviews from critics
The film adaptation of the second book in the Divergent trilogy Insurgent is scheduled to be released as on March 20 2015 Allegiant the third and final novel in the series will be adapted into two feature-length parts will be released on March 18 2016 and will be released on March 24 2017
Development
In March 2011 Summit Entertainment picked up the rights for Divergent with Douglas Wick and Lucy Fisher's production company Red Wagon Entertainment
Neil Burger was announced as the director on August 23 2012 Evan Daugherty who co-wrote the screenplay with Vanessa Taylor said I get hung up on the toughness of the movie but of equal importance is the love story between Tris and Four It's inherently and inextricably linked to Tris character journey There will be plenty of sexual tension and chemistry but it's important that all of that stuff doesn't just feel like it's thrown in but that it all helps Tris grow as a character Daugherty further added It's tricky because the book is a very packed read with a lot of big ideas So distilling that into a cool faithful two-hour movie is challenging Not only do you have to establish five factions but you have to acknowledge that there's a sixth entity which is the divergent and you also have the factionless So there's a world that really has to be built out for the big screenÅc the movie is going to do it a little more efficiently Author Veronica Roth said about the script of the film Reading a script is a really interesting experience I'd never read a script before I was really impressed by how closely it stuck to the general plot line of the book
Initially the budget of the film was $40 million but later Lionsgate increased it to $80 million which finally changed to $85 million due to the success of The Hunger Games Analyst Ben Mogil said Divergent is more similar to Hunger Games in that the company owns the underlying economics i.e production and the budget at $80 is more manageable
In December 2013 Summit Entertainment announced that a film adaptation of Insurgent the second novel in the Divergent trilogy would be released as The Divergent Series Insurgent on March 20 2015 as a sequel to the film adaptation of Divergent with Brian Duffield originally chosen to write the script for the film On December 16 2013 it was announced that Neil Burger director of Divergent would not return to direct Insurgent due to him still working on the first film On February 13 2014 it was announced that Robert Schwentke was offered the director position for the film and that Akiva Goldsman had been hired to re-write Duffield's script

Though James was 10 years older than the character when cast Roth praised his casting I was sure within seconds this was Four no question Theo is able to capture Four's authority and strength as well as his depth and sensitivity She also mentions the chemistry between him and Shailene He is a perfect match for Shailene's incredibly strong presence as Tris I'm thrilled The producers said about his casting We took our time to find the right actor to fill the role of Four and Theo is definitely the perfect fit Veronica has crafted a truly iconic character in Four and we cannot wait to begin production and bring him and this story to life for millions of fans around the world

After a series of commissions for the Oxford University Press Gill began an association with The Bodley Head for whom she illustrated over thirty books between 1957 and 1982 including Margaret KornitzerÅfs 1960 novel about adoption Mr Fairweather and his Family and books by Anita Hewett Roger Lancelyn Green and others John Ryder the publisher's design and art director said her early work was interfered with rather than aided by her background in etching and engraving but as her drawings became bolder her work became more in demand her serious unsentimental view of childhood suiting the kitchen sink realism prevalent in children's books at the time She remarked that is often how children are ? taking their own lives seriously
Eleanor Graham the founding editor of Puffin Books also sought her out to illustrate books including a 1961 edition of A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett She worked for numerous other publishers including Jonathan Cape for whom she illustrated Susan Cooper's Over Sea Under Stone in 1965 and Chatto & Windus for whom she illustrated Cooper's Dawn of Fear in 1972 drawing on her own memories of living in London during the Second World War Cooper said of her work on Dawn of Fear She caught the image of the kids I was writing about perfectly with no communication That does huge things for the confidence of a writer She would often travel to capture the landscape and setting of books she illustrated particularly those by Ruth Arthur and William Mayne and for this reason a German publisher commissioned her to illustrate a German translation of Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons

Water crisis in Iran

Water crisis in Iran refers to the problems which due to the water scarcity occur in Iran Water scarcity can be a result of two mechanisms physical absolute water scarcity and economic water scarcity where physical water scarcity is a result of inadequate natural water resources to supply a region's demand and economic water scarcity is a result of poor management of the sufficient available water resources Iran is encountered to both problems
Water resources
Climate
Rainfall in Iran is highly seasonal with a rainy season between October and March leaving the land parched for the remainder of the year Immense seasonal variations in flow characterize Iran's rivers For example the Karun River in Khuzestan carries water during periods of maximum flow that is ten times the amount borne in dry periods In numerous localities there may be no precipitation until sudden storms accompanied by heavy rains dump almost the entire year's rainfall in a few days Water shortages are compounded by the unequal distribution of water Near the Caspian Sea rainfall averages about 1,280?mm per year but in the Central Plateau and in the lowlands to the south it seldom exceeds 100?mm
Water availability
Internal renewable water resources are estimated at 128.5 billion cubic meters BCM)/year average for 1977-2001 Surface runoff represents a total of 97.3 BCM/year of which 5.4 BCM/year comes from drainage of the aquifers and thus needs to be subtracted from the total Groundwater recharge is estimated at about 49.3 BCM/year of which 12.7 BCM/year is obtained from infiltration in the river bed and also needs to be subtracted Iran receives 6.7 BCM/year of surface water from Pakistan and some water from Afghanistan through the Helmand River The flow of the Arax river at the border with Azerbaijan is estimated at 4.6 BCM/year The surface runoff to the sea and to other countries is estimated at 55.9 BCM/year Per capita water availability in the pre-Islamic Revolution era was about 4,500 cubic meters But in 2009 this figure was less than 2,000 cubic meters
Dams
There are 42 large dams under operation in Iran with a combined storage capacity of 33 BCM/year These dams lose about 200 million cubic meters of storage capacity every year due to sedimentation 0.5-0.75% of their storage capacity Most dams are multi-purpose dams for hydropower irrigation flood control and - in some cases - drinking water supply
Water use
The total water withdrawal was estimated at about 70 BCM in 1993 rising to 93 BCM in 2004 of which 92% was used for agricultural purposes 6% for domestic use and 2% for industrial use Although this is equal to 51% of the actual available renewable water resources annual abstraction from aquifers 57 BCM in 1993 53 BCM in 2004 is already more than the estimated safe yield 46 BCM Of the 4.3 BCM/year in 1993 6.2 in 2004 used for domestic purposes 61% is supplied from surface water and 39% from groundwater For example Greater Tehran with its population of more than 13 million is supplied by surface water from the Lar dam on the Lar River in the Northeast of the city the Latyan dam on the Jajrood River in the North the Karaj River in the Northwest as well as by groundwater in the vicinity of the city Provinces of Gilan Mazandaran and Isfahan have the highest efficiency of irrigation with 54 52 and 42 percents respectively and Khuzestan province has the lowest irrigation efficiency with 38 percent Tap water consumption in the country is 70% over and above the global average 16 BCM of water was used for power generation in 1999 As of 2014 Iran is using 70% of its total renewable freshwater far above the upper limit of 40% recommended according to international norms
Infrastructure
Most drinking water in Iran is supplied through modern infrastructure such as dams reservoirs long-distance transmission pipelines - some of which are more than 300?km long - and deep wells An estimated 60,000 traditional Karez ????? systems in the plateau regions of Iran in Yazd Khorasan and Kerman - are still in use today for irrigation and drinking water supply in rural areas and small towns The oldest and largest known Karez is in the Iranian city of Gonabad which after 2700 years still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000 people Its main well depth is more than 360 meters and its length is 45 kilometers It is estimated that there are as many as 500,000 deep and shallow wells in the country
Water pollution
is caused by industrial and municipal wastewater as well as by agriculture Concerning municipal wastewater the bulk of collected sewage is discharged untreated and constitutes a major source of pollution to groundwater and a risk to public health In a number of cities without sanitary sewerage households discharge their sewage through open rainwater drains
Water crisis
In December 2013 Hamid Chitchian head of the Ministry of Energy which is in charge of regulating the water sector ? stated that the sector's situation had reached Ågcritical levels.Åh He correctly established that past approaches which mainly focused on constructing dams and trying to increase the storage capacity would no longer be appropriate remedies In fact total storage capacity behind the countryÅfs many dams amounts to 68 billion cubic meters whereas the water potential of the countryÅfs rivers totals 46 billion cubic meters per annum
In July 2013 Issa Kalantari the Minister of Agricultural under president Hashemi Rafsanjani told Ghanoon newspaper that the water crisis is the Ågmain problem that threatensÅh Iran adding that it is more dangerous Ågthan Israel USA or political fightingÅh among the Iranian elite.ÅgIf the water issue is not addressed Iran could become Åginhabitable.If this situation is not reformed in 30 years Iran will be a ghost town Even if there is precipitation in the desert there will be no yield because the area for groundwater will be dried and water will remain at ground level and evaporate.Åh

Prior authorization

Prior authorization is a process used by some health insurance companies in the United States to determine if they will cover a prescribed procedure service or medication The process is intended to act as a safety and cost savings measure although it has received criticism from physicians for being costly and time consuming
Overview
Prior authorization is a check run by some insurance companies or third party payers before they will agree to cover certain prescribed medications or medical procedures There are a number of reasons that insurance providers require prior authorization including age medical necessity the availability of a generic alternative or checking for drug interactions A failed authorization can result in a requested service being denied or an insurance company requiring the patient to go through a separate process known as step therapy or fail first Step therapy dictates that a patient must first see unsuccessful results from a medication or service preferred by the insurance provider typically considered either more cost effective or safer before the insurance company will cover a different service
Process
After a physician orders a medical service for a patient the physician's staff will contact the patient's insurer to determine if they require a prior authorization check to be run If so a manual process is initiated The process to obtain prior authorization varies from insurer to insurer but typically involves the completion and faxing of a prior authorization form At this point the medical service may be approved rejected or additional information may be requested If a service is rejected the physician may file an appeal based on the provider's medical review process In some cases an insurer may take up to 30 days to approve a request
Purpose and costs
Insurers have stated that the purpose of prior authorization checks is to provide cost savings to consumers by preventing unnecessary procedures as well as the prescribing of expensive brand name drugs when an appropriate generic is available In addition a prior authorization for a new prescription may help prevent potentially dangerous drug interactions A 2009 report from the Medical Board of Georgia showed that as many as 800 medical services require prior authorizations
According to Medical Economics physicians have expressed frustration with the current prior authorization process with regards to time spent interacting with insurance providers and the costs incurred based on that time A 2009 study published in Health Affairs reported that primary care physicians spent 1.1 hours per week fulfilling prior authorizations nursing staff spent 13.1 hours per week and clerical staff spent 5.6 hours A study in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine found that the annual cost per physician to conduct prior authorizations was between $2,161 and $3,430 The cost to health plans has been reported at between $10 and $25 per request It is estimated that current prior authorization practices cost the US healthcare system between $23 and $31 billion annually
Legislative and technological developments
There have been a number of legislative and technological developments which attempt to make the prior authorization process more efficient
In 2011 the American Medical Association made recommendations that a uniform prior authorization form should be adopted along with real-time electronic processing The organization described a next generation prior authorization process which would involve a physician ordering a medical service their staff completing a standardized request form and an electronic submission process that would give same-day approval or denial of the request The reasoning behind a denial would be clearly stated allowing physicians to easily submit an appeal
In February 2012 The Maryland Health Care Commission presented a plan to the state legislature which outlined a standardized electronic filing system for prior authorization requests In response to a 2012 bill concerning the e-filing of prescriptions the Kansas Board of Pharmacies advocated for an electronic prior authorization process which would generate immediate approval for prescriptions In 2013 the Arizona House of Representatives formed a committee to research the prior authorization process and make recommendations Also by 2013 a Washington State Senate proposal was submitted which would require the state Insurance Commissioner to develop a standardized prior authorization form
As of May 2013 the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs had adopted a standardized process for the exchange of electronic prior authorizations The American Medical Association found that the average annual savings per physician from using an electronic prior authorization process to be approximately $1,742 Additionally a case study conducted by Prime Therapeutics a pharmacy benefit manager demonstrated a 90% reduction in payer response time through electronic prior authorization systems compared with the manual prior authorization process

World War Two
An introduction to Arnold Palmer resulted in the commission for Recording Britain the counties she was allocated included Bedfordshire Hertfordshire Cheshire Derbyshire Staffordshire and Cornwall The Victoria & Albert Museum holds 14 while sadly three Bedfordshire and one Cornish watercolour are still missing Cheek was especially intrigued by Mow Cop below the hill on which Primitive Methodism was founded in 1810
The numerous participating artists in the scheme exhibited at the National Gallery emptied of its own collection and the handsome four volume hardback set published just after the war by OUP partly financed by the Pilgrim Trust from the USA enhanced their reputations both at home and abroad In 1943 and 1944 Cheek exhibited at the Royal Academy where a painting entitled Blood Donors was sold but unfortunately its present whereabouts remains unknown In September 1944 the War Artists Advisory Committee purchased for six guineas the picture Suburban Flying-bomb Damage from Cheek In 1945 a painting entitled Study of American soldiers standing outside the Rainbow Corner North London was sold to James Bussy of Sheffield Her work in portraiture continued apace and one of the most characteristic paintings remaining in her own collection is that of her father Percy Ebsworth Cheek in his ARP helmet She describes how everyone was so debilitated towards the end of war ?

Painting Styles
Fresh primary colours characterise her work of the 60s and 70s highlights of red abound in her still lives and portraits pots of geraniums a summer hat the costume of an Indian wooden marionette Trees were always important sources of subject matter the pear tree in the garden of Christchurch Hill features from the moment they moved to Hampstead In her later career a series of large canvases painted with a rich brownish palette reflect her interest in spiritualism Freud and Jung in particular While she was growing up her father had not encouraged a religious leaning in his household and she may have found an equally cool reception from her husband an atheist for this work but there is an unmistakable passion/ambition therein
In 2009 an anthology of her poems The Silent Fairground was published and a review written by Piers Plowright for the Camden New Journal
In autumn of 2013 an exhibition was held at Burgh House

General information for those unfamiliar
The council of the Rugby Football League voted to introduce a new competition to be similar to The Football Association and Scottish Football Association's League Cup It was to be a similar knock-out structure to and to be secondary to the Challenge Cup As this was being formulated sports sponsorship was becoming more prevalent and as a result John Player and Sons a division of Imperial Tobacco Company became sponsors and the competition never became widely known as the League Cup
The competition ran from 1971-72 until 1995-96 and was initially intended for the professional clubs plus the two amateur BARLA National Cup finalists In later seasons the entries were expanded to take in other amateur and French teams The competition was dropped due to fixture congestion when Rugby League became a summer sport
The Rugby League season always until the onset of Summer Rugby in 1996 ran from around August-time through to around May-time and this competition always took place early in the season in the Autumn with the final usually taking place in late January
The competition was variably known by its sponsorship name as the Player's No.6 Trophy 1971?1977 the John Player Trophy 1977?1983 the John Player Special Trophy 1983?1989 and the Regal Trophy in 1989

Workshops for Careers in the Arts

Workshops for Careers in the Arts was a professional training program for artistically talented teenagers which took place on the campus of The George Washington University in a joint collaboration Designated a pilot program Workshops for Careers in the Arts was created in June 1968 by Peggy Cooper Cafritz and Mike Malone as a means toward the establishment of a public high school for the arts in Washington D.C
There were three departments in the school program at the start of its formation They were in Drama/Theatre Dance and Visual Arts/Painting These departments serviced qualified area students after their normal home school day on weekends during the academic year and full time during the summer months Roughly ninety 90 students were enrolled during the inaugural years Funding eventually became increasingly available as lobbying grants enrollment contributions and stellar reputations regarding the program significantly increased
Students were accepted on the basis of recommendations from area Principals Teachers Parents interviews and auditions Talented students who could not otherwise afford such training were given top priority Workshops for Careers in the Arts enrolled and had diverse students from all over the Washington Metropolitan region No student was required to pay a tuition
Upon leaving the program the students were encouraged to continue their career training Workshops for Careers in the Arts students began to achieve collegiate full scholarships and receive contracts toward higher education The George Washington University The Washington School of Ballet The North Carolina School of the Arts The Juilliard School and Howard University were some of the very first illustrious institutions to receive Workshops for Careers in the Arts graduates Some graduates had opportunities to start professional careers in their field soon after their departure from the program
Workshops for Careers in the Arts showed the need for and the results of specialized vocational training in the arts As more successful Workshops for Careers in the Arts years past which included the need for an additional space location on Georgia Avenue at Morton Street N.W the Washington community made this opportunity available to their young people on a much broader scale In the process during 1974 the Duke Ellington High School at Western High School in Washington D.C was born The goal was achieved
Duke Ellington School of the Arts was established as an accredited four 4 year public high school curriculum combining arts and academics in the Nation's Capital
Thanks to the brilliant Staff Faculty Students and Alumni of Workshops for Careers in the Arts


Claes Duyst van Voorhout

Claes Duyst van Voorhout is a portrait painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Frans Hals painted in 1638 and now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art New York City
Painting
The painting shows a tastefully dressed young man in a floppy hat with his hand on his hip in a characteristic Hals pose The dress of the man fits his occupation that of a Haarlem brewer but unlike other Haarlem brewers that Hals portrayed we don't find his name in the archives of the local militias We don't know the occasion for which it was painted but the painting is probably not a wedding pendant because Hals was quite consistent with his pendant portraits positioning the man on the left and the woman on the right This allowed the light which always shines from the left in his paintings to shine directly on the woman's face and not the man's Possibly this portrait was made to decorate a hofje or his brewery so that people who worked for him or visited the premises could know what the owner Claes Duyst van Voorhout looked like For the same reason it is also possible that this painting was a pendant to the portrait of a business partner rather than a wife For example the shape size period and position matches that of Portrait of a Young man holding a glove
Provenance
The painting is one of the best documented paintings in Hals oeuvre first documented by Gustav Friedrich Waagen in his description of the paintings of the Lord Egremont in 1854 After that it was included by Wilhelm von Bode in 1883 by Ernst Wilhelm Moes in 1909 Hofstede de Groot in 1910 by W.R Valentiner in 1923 Trivas in 1941 and by Gerrit David Gratama in 1946 Both Seymour Slive and Claus Grimm agree it is by Hals
The MET lists various sale entries from Lord Egremont's time up to their acquisition date In his 1989 catalog of the international Frans Hals exhibition Slive included discussion of an old label on the back which listed the portrayed man as Claes Duyst van Voorhout brewer in De Zwaanschel 20th-century archival research revealed that a Nicolaes Pietersz Duyst van Voorhout indeed was owner of the brewery called the Swaenshals Swan's neck who testified in Haarlem in 1629 that he was 29 years old which fits the date for this portrait that was painted about 10 years later

Edward Quin ca.1843 ? 22 November 1922 was a noted pastoralist in the north-west of New South Wales who represented Wentworth and Broken Hill in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly
History
Edward Quin set up in business in Wilcannia New South Wales when that town was in its infancy then in 1872 took over Tarella Estate a station of 685,000 acres 50 miles from Wilcannia and spent Åí70,000 on improvements on the property which eventually was carrying 120,000 sheep 1000 Shorthorn cattle and around 180 pure bred horses plus draught horses and Arabs He formed a business Quin Currie and Co to operate the business
In 1881 he purchased with Alfred Kirkpatrick of Wilcannia Merweh station in the Warrego River in Queensland They bought Buckanbe station near Tilpa later the same year
He was elected a member for Wentworth in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in a by-election 1882 an early opponent was E B L Dickens son of Charles Dickens and returned in December that year then again unopposed in 1885 and declined to stand in 1887 He was later appointed to the committee which was concerned with the rabbit pest

Prashastapada

Prashastapada was an ancient Indian philosopher He wrote the Pad?rthadharma-sanghra Collection of Properties of Matter and a commentary titled Prashastap?da Bh?shya on the Vaisheshika Sutras of Kanada Circa 6th Century BCE both texts are comprehensive books in physics covering a range from general physics to quantum physics In these texts Prashastapada discusses the properties of motion Ganganath Jha had translated Prashastap?da Bh?shya which translation was published in 1916 Prashasta or Pra?asta Sanskrit ??????? means praised or praiseworthy lauded or laudable commended or commendable or eulogized
Dayananda Saraswati writes that the Sutras of Kan?da and Padarthadharmasanghra of Prashastap?da do not show much influence of the Nyaya System Prashastap?da Bh?shya is actually not a commentary but an independent compendium of the tenets of the Vaisheshika School Udayanacharya of the Navya-Ny?ya School the author of Lakshanavali which gives the definitions of Vaisheshika terms and Nyaya Kusumanjali which is a systematic account of Nyaya Theism who also belonged to Mithila had written Kiranavali which is a commentary on Prashastap?da Bh?shya
Prashtap?da lived in the 4th century AD The Vaisheshika philosophy recognizes twenty-four gunas or qualities that are inherent in substances these include seventeen gunas listed by Kanada and seven gunas ? gurutva heaviness dravatva fluidity sneha viscidity dharma merit adharma demerit shabda sound and samskara faculty - added by Prashtap?da Vyomavati of Vyomashekhara Nyayakandali of Shridhara Kiranavali of Udayana and Lilavati of Shrivatsa are well known commentaries on his works
Prashastap?da refers to a type of perception that is the simple intuition alochana of the proper form svarupa of an entity which is the apprehension of an undifferentiated avibhktam whole arising from cognition of its specific universals This is the preliminary stage He differs from Dign?ga for whom the determinates of cognitions are subjective constructs imposed upon the given and constructive cognition is not a perception Prashastap?da who was a realist avers that the determinates are objective constituents of reality and their conceptual co-relates are not inter-subjective fictions Prashastap?da by redefining substance as per se a possessor of attributes opened new turf by separating the cosmological from the logical dimensions of concepts His commentary overshadowed the Vaisheshika Sutras and became the main vehicle for later commentaries Prashastap?da describes the dissolution of the earth water air and fire in terms of their atomic constituents but excludes space because space is non-atomic With regard to the conjoining and disjoining of atoms he includes a higher will or order as the guiding principle of universal dissolution which over-rides the natural karma of atoms
Kan?da does not directly refer to Ishvara God but Prashastapada sees Ishvara as the cause of the universe but does not explain how God creates

Research Projects
Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean SEDLAC
The Center for Distributional Labor and Social Studies CEDLAS of the University of La Plata in partnership with the World Bank Latin America and the Caribbean Poverty and Gender Group LCSPP have developed the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean SEDLAC with the purpose of improving the timely access to key socio-economic statistics including indicators on poverty inequality income employment access to services education health housing social programs and numerous demographics All statistics are computed from microdata of the main household surveys carried out in the countries
Household surveys are not uniform among countries of Latin America and the Caribbean In particular they differ significantly in their geographic coverage and questionnaires There are also differences in the periodicity of surveys within a country
This project seeks to ensure that statistics are comparable as far as possible between countries and over time This is done using similar definitions of variables in each country/year and applying consistent methods of data processing In this way SEDLAC allows users to monitor the trends in poverty and other distributional and social indicators in the region The dataset is available in the form of brief reports charts and electronic Excel tables with information for each country/year In addition the website visitor can carry out dynamic searches online in the official website
This website presents enough documentation so that each user decides whether or not to make comparisons considering the available information their preferences and needs The Methodological Guide describes the tables available in each section of the database and discusses the main methodological decisions taken to construct the variables
This section contains methodological documents with precise explanations of the construction and estimation of each variable the countries and surveys analyzed and the period covered in the SEDLAC database
The database includes information from over 300 household surveys carried out in 24 LAC countries Argentina Bahamas Belize Bolivia Brazil Colombia Costa Rica Chile Dominican Republic Ecuador El Salvador Guatemala Guyana Haiti Honduras Jamaica Mexico Nicaragua Panama Paraguay Peru Suriname Uruguay and Venezuela
In each period the sample of countries represents more than 97% of LAC total population The database mainly covers the 1990s and 2000s although they also present information for previous decades in a few countries
SEDLAC is continually updated and improved based on the feedback from users Aside from cross country analyses staff from CEDLAS and LCSPP analyze and incorporate the data at the country level each time a new survey is available Consistency checks with other national or international sources of socio-economic statistics are conducted regularly
Through the support to this project LCSPP contributes to develop analytical capacity and facilitate policy relevant research in the Latin America and Caribbean region that can contribute to reduce poverty and inequality Social and distributive indicators from these dataset are used for the World Bank World Development Indicators and published in the WIDER-UN World Income Inequality Database
Labor markets for inclusive growth in Latin America
The Center for Distributional Labor and Social Studies CEDLAS in cooperation with the International Development Research Centre IDRC from Canada have developed a research project about the role of the labor market as vectors of inclusive growth in Latin America It will seek to account for the implications of changes in labor supply firm employment demand labor market policies and partial social protection reforms
The research and capacity building agenda lies at the intersection of labor supply and demand perspectives which have addressed these issues separately in the existing literature for the region The project will contribute to bridge the two approaches by jointly developing a series of studies at the worker and at the firm levels This research agenda will provide evidence on the inter-relation between social protection reforms informality poverty reduction labor market regulations crises job creation and productivity
All the Project studies the rest of the activities labor market indicators and maps can be found in the project's website
Enhancing WomenÅfs Economic Empowerment through Better Policies in Latin America
The Interdisciplinary Center for Development Studies-Uruguay CIEDUR with the Center for Distributional Labor and Social Studies CEDLAS in Argentina and the support the International Development Research Centre IDRC from Canada are working together in the development of this research project The project's objective is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of policies that promote gender equality in labor markets
The reality of eight Latin American countries like Argentina Chile Ecuador Bolivia El Salvador Mexico Nicaragua and Uruguay are being studied applying an innovative mix of research methods including econometrics models impact evaluation of the policies meta analysis and depth interviews
The project will provide country level and comparative empirical evidence that will serve as inputs to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of policies that promote gender equality The comparative analysis of countries which all experienced sustained economic growth will provide insights into the factors that contribute to the persistence of gender inequalities amidst such growth and the role of institutional frameworks and policies that could have a major impact to tackle them
In the project's website are the research findings the projects activities and data including visualization tools
Fostering capacities in Impact Evaluation in Latin America
With the support of the International Development Research Centre IDRC-Canada CEDLAS will aim to develop a capacity building initiative based on training courses on impact evaluation scholarships and other activities to foster professional education The objective is to provide training activities in impact evaluation in the region on a regular basis More information can be found in the website

After the Bath Woman drying herself

After the Bath Woman drying herself is a pastel drawing by Edgar Degas made about 1890?95 It has been in the collection of the National Gallery London since 1959
Artwork
The work depicts a woman sitting on white towels spread over a wicker chair with her back to the viewer Her body is arched and slightly twisted creating a tension in her back accentuated by the deep line of her backbone One hand dries her neck with a towel presumably after getting out of the tin bath in the corner of the room The other arm leans out to hold onto the chair for support The space is defined by the vertical and diagonal lines where the floor and walls meet
The drawing was made on several pieces of paper mounted on cardboard Degas may have started with a smaller composition which he extended as he worked requiring more paper The heavily worked pastel creates deep textures and blurred contours emphasising the figure's movement The artwork measures
History
Edgar Degas often used photographs and sketches as a preliminary step studying the light and the composition for his paintings The work is part of a series of photographs preliminary sketches and completed works in pastels and oils by Degas from this period The series depict women dancing or bathing some showing women in awkward unnatural positions Degas speaking about these works said he intended to create a feeling in the viewer as if you looked through a keyhole Degas included many works of female nudes bathing in the last Impressionist exhibition in 1886
Nine of Degas pastel drawings of women at their bath were exhibited by Theo Van Gogh at Galerie Boussod et Valadon in 1888 The work was shown at the Lefevre Gallery in 1950 and was bought for the collection of the National Gallery London in 1959 A less highly worked example of a similar subject is in the Courtauld Gallery and other works in the series are in many public museums
Influences
The work had a considerable influence on Francis Bacon most noticeably on his triptychs Three Figures in a Room 1964 Centre Pompidou Paris and Three Studies of the Male Back 1970 Kunsthaus Zurich The Tate Gallery says For Bacon was indeed something of a talisman It epitomised Degas's approach to a larger obsession the two artists shared with the plasticity of the body its potential for the most varied forms of articulation in movement and repose The work was one of three central nudes chosen by Bacon in his The Artist's Choice exhibition at the National Gallery in 1985 shown between Velazquez's Rokeby Venus and Michelangelo's Entombment Art historian and curator Michael Peppiatt quoted Bacon thus I love Degas I think his pastels are among the greatest things ever made I think they're far greater than his paintings

Black Moor Rhon

The Black Moor is an important internationally recognised wetland located in the Bavarian Rhon Mountains at the tripoint of the German states of Hesse Thuringia and Bavaria It is part of UNESCO's Rhon Biosphere Reserve and has an area of 66.4?hectares It is thus the largest bog complex in the Rhon Much of the moor is a largely undisturbed and intact raised bog It is part of the Europe-wide conservation system Natura 2000 and one of the most important raised bogs in Central Europe The Black Moor lies on the watershed between the Rhine and Weser rivers In 2007 the Black Moor was included in the List of the 100 most beautiful geotopes in Bavaria
The Black Moor is an eccentric cupola-shaped raised bog Its surface appearance resembles that of the northern Kermimoor bogs From its central plateau which lies near the higher edge of the bog in the north where the peat is up to 8 metres thick in places the surface of the terrain falls away on all sides The central plateau forms an almost rectangular area with a length of about 800 metres from northwest to southeast and a width of about 400 metres On the steepest slopes there are hollows running parallel to the contours elongated sharply defined troughs known as Schlenken These are up to 50 metres long and between one and three metres deep
Location
The Black Moor lies in the Lower Franconian parish of Hausen six kilometres from Fladungen on the Hochrhonstrase and on the state road ST 2287 from Seiferts one kilometre southeast of the border with Thuringia and two kilometres east of the border with Hesse It lies at an elevation of 770 to 782?metres above sea level NN in a shallow hollow that slopes gently southeast on the upper slopes of the 805-metre-high Querenberg whose summit is about one kilometre to the west
The bog is drained mainly by the Eisgraben twelve metres lower to the south This stream empties into the Streu six kilometres east and 400?metres lower down its waters forming part of the drainage basin of the River Rhine Another stream drains the bog into the Hessian Ulster which is three kilometres to the west and just under 300?metres lower and belongs to the Weser basin
Name
The Black Moor along with the Red Moor is one of the larger moors in the High Rhon whose name according to tradition comes from the colour of the original vegetation The vicar cooperator of Simmershausen Franz Anton Jager a keen naturalist wrote in his letters about the High Rhoene of Franconia published in 1803 that the Black Moor was much wetter than the Red Moor As a result the red Magellan's Peatmoss Sphagnum magellanicum the plant that gave the Red Moor its name and which also grew in the Black Moor became waterlogged as soon as it germinated became mouldy and black thus giving rise to the name of the Black Moor Even today the name appears apt
Moorlehrpfad
Als Schutzmasnahme zur Erhaltung des Naturschutzgebietes umgab die Pflegetruppe des Naturparks 1976 das Schwarze Moor mit einem zwei Meter hohen und 4,8 Kilometer langen Zaun Diese Arbeiten geschahen in enger Arbeits- und Fordergemeinschaft mit der Regierung von Unterfranken der Flurbereinigungsdirektion Wurzburg und der Oberforstdirektion Um der Bevolkerung weiterhin den Zugang zum Moor zu ermoglichen wurde 1976 innerhalb des Schutzgebietes ein erster befestigter Weg errichtet Anfang der 1980er Jahre wurde ein 1,8 Kilometer langer Knuppeldamm gebaut der zu den interessantesten Bereichen des Moores fuhrte Die Schutzmasnahmen haben sich positiv auf die Regenerierung des Moores ausgewirkt Einige Tiere und Pflanzen sind jedoch verschwunden bevor die Schutzmasnahmen umgesetzt worden sind Darunter befand sich die zuvor im Moor grosflachig gewachsene Blumenbinse die zuletzt 1960 gesehen worden ist
In der Folgezeit wurde der Steg durch Verwitterung und starke Belastung beschadigt so dass aus Sicherheitsgrunden eine umgehende Erneuerung notwendig wurde Zum Schutz des vom Aussterben bedrohten Birkwildes wurde die Lange Rhon in der auch das Schwarze Moor liegt am 28.?Mai 1982 mit der heutigen Flache von 3245 Hektar als Naturschutzgebiet ausgewiesen Bei der Planung des neuen Steges der mit einer neuen Trasse durch das Moor verlaufen sollte wurden die im Moor gefahrdeten Einstande berucksichtigt Im Mai 1987 wurde der neue Moorweg als erster Moorlehrpfad in Bayern mit einem 2,2 Kilometer langen Eichen-Bohlensteg eroffnet Entlang des Steges stellen 22 Informationstafeln die Tier- und Pflanzenwelt des Moores vor Verlandende Wasserflachen sind zu Schwingrasen mutiert seit 2000 sind Wiederbewasserungsmasnahmen im Gange Ehemalige Entwasserungsgraben wurden zu diesem Zweck durch kleine Stauwehre verschlossen um das Wasser im Moor zu halten
2001 wurden die Informationstafeln des Lehrpfades als gemeinsame Initiative der Regierung von Unterfranken der Bayerischen Verwaltungsstelle Biospharenreservat Rhon und des Naturparks Rhon im Zuge der Umsetzung des landerubergreifenden EU-Projektes LIFE neu gestaltet und deren Zahl auf 23 erhoht Diplom-Biologin Ursula Schneider hatte hierbei die Koordination und fachliche Gesamtleitung inne In den vergangenen Jahren wurde der Moorlehrpfad erweitert Im letzten Teil des Rundweges zweigt ein weiterer Bohlensteg vom Lehrpfad ab und fuhrt direkt zum Ein- und Ausgang des Moores Im Jahr 2007 wurde am nordlichen Rand des Moores neben dem Bohlensteg fur 225.000?Euro ein 17?Meter hoher Aussichtsturm mit einer 56 Quadratmeter grosen Plattform errichtet Der Aussichtsturm befindet sich in der Nahe des abzweigenden erweiterten Abschnittes und ist auch direkt vom Eingang des Schwarzen Moores aus zu erreichen
Der erste Abschnitt des Lehrpfades wird doppelt?? als Hin- und Ruckweg?? und der weitere Verlauf als Rundweg begangen Die gesamte Wegstrecke betragt 2,7?Kilometer und fuhrt an den verschiedenen Bereichen des Moores vorbei Der Eingang des Moores befindet sich nordlich und fuhrt von dort aus zunachst nach Suden am Rand eines Karpatenbirkenwaldes vorbei Der Weg fuhrt weiter zum Niedermoor welches sich als Sumpfgurtel um das intakte Hochmoor zieht Der Lehrpfad verlauft im grosen Bogen und fuhrt dann in nordlicher Richtung auf die zentrale Hochflache Er fuhrt an einem Moorauge an Flarken und Schlenken vorbei Von diesem Bereich des Weges ist die komplette zentrale Hochflache zu uberblicken Der Weg fuhrt von der zentralen Flache weiter durch das Niedermoor dann zum Aussichtsturm und von dort mit zwei verschiedenen Wegvarianten zum Ausgang zuruck Der Weg von der zentralen Moorflache zum Turm fuhrt an einem Wasserloch einem ehemaligen kleinen verlandeten Torfstich vorbei
Geotop
Das Schwarze Moor wird im Umweltobjektkatalog UOK Bayern als Geotop mit dem Pradikat wertvoll gefuhrt In Bayern werden vom Geologischen Landesamt jetzt Bayerisches Landesamt fur Umwelt etwa 2800 Geotope detailliert beschrieben Aus diesen wahlt ein Gremium von Fachleuten der obersten Fachbehorde fur Geologie Natur Wasser und Umwelt seit 2001 die 100 Geotope aus die als die wichtigsten angesehen werden Das Schwarze Moor wurde von diesem Gremium am 20.?Juli 2007 als 56 Objekt von Bayerns schonsten Geotopen gewahlt Das Schwarze Moor wird als Torfgemeinschaft mit der Geotop-Nummer 47 und als Geotop 673R008 ausgewiesen Siehe hierzu auch die Liste der Geotope im Landkreis Rhon-Grabfeld
Tourismus
Das Schwarze Moor ist touristisch gut erschlossen und ein beliebtes Ausflugsziel in der Rhon Jahrlich wird das frei zugangliche rollstuhlgerecht ausgebaute Schwarze Moor von 100.000 bis 150.000 Personen besucht es liegt damit hinter dem Kreuzberg an zweiter Stelle in der bayerischen Rhon Von Mai bis Oktober werden mehrmals in der Woche gefuhrte Wanderungen durch das Moor angeboten 300 Meter nordostlich des Schwarzen Moores an der Strase nach Seiferts befindet sich ein groser Parkplatz und das 2005 neu erbaute Haus zum Schwarzen Moor mit Sanitaranlagen Kiosk und Imbissbereich und dem Informationszentrum Am ostlichen Rand des Schwarzen Moores hat die 2005 eroffnete Umweltbildungsstation des Biospharenreservates Bayerische Rhon ihren Sitz mit einem Schulungsraum fur Schulklassen und einem uberdachten Arbeitsbereich im Freien
Reichsarbeitsdienst-Lager
Das ehemalige Reichsarbeitsdienst RAD)-Lager Hochrhon auch als Dr.?Hellmuth-Lager bezeichnet lag am ostlichen Rand des Schwarzen Moores Ein steinernes Tor im Eingangsbereich 1936 errichtet erinnert als Mahnmal daran Das Lager wurde zwischen August 1934 und Fruhjahr 1936 errichtet und beherbergte etwa 300 Personen Mainfrankens Gauleiter Dr.?Otto Hellmuth wollte mit seinem Rhonaufbauplan die wirtschaftlich schwache Region kultivieren und fur die Landwirtschaft offnen so genannter Dr-Hellmuth-Plan zur Neuordnung des Gaues Mainfranken Die Rhon war als Notstandsgebiet aus dem ein Wohlstandsgebiet werden sollte definiert Aufgaben des RAD waren Drainagen legen Entfernung von Steinen Fichtenanpflanzungen und Kartoffelanbau Die Masnahmen brachten nicht das gewunschte Ergebnis 1945 wurde das Lager aufgegeben und bis auf die Fundamente abgetragen die heute noch zu erkennen sind Von den RAD-Mannern wurde bis 1938 der Rhonhof als Musterhof fertiggestellt Wahrend dieser Zeit wurden etwa 500 Hektar Jungwald aufgeforstet Die Aufforstungen um das Schwarze Moor ruhren von diesen Masnahmen her
Sagen und Legenden

Eine weitere Geschichte uber das Moor handelt vom Seevogelchen Es wird erzahlt dass im Schwarzen Moor in lauen Sommernachten manchmal ein Vogel singt ein seltsames Lied um jedes Mal zu verschwinden wenn in der Morgendammerung die Aveglocke aus der Tiefe des Sumpfes klingt
Gebet gegen Uberschwemmung
In der Gemeinde Rudenschwinden wurde bis etwa 1780 seit alters her jeden Freitag eine Betstunde abgehalten um eine befurchtete Uberschwemmung des Dorfes und die Vernichtung der Fluren abzuwenden Die Gemeinde befurchtete dass das Moor in einer sturmischen Nacht rauscht und tobt um dann auszubrechen und die ganze Gegend zu uberschwemmen
Das Moor als Wetterprophet
Fur die umliegenden Dorfer dient das Schwarze Moor als Wetterprophet Wenn am Morgen leichter Dunst auf dem Moor liegt gibt es keinen schonen Tag Trubes regnerisches Wetter wird am Morgen durch dichten Dunst prophezeit Raucht das Moor am Morgen so ist mit Sturm und Gewitter zu rechnen Mit dem schlimmsten Unwetter ist zu rechnen wenn fruhmorgens schon ein Sturm uber das Moor fegt dass die Mooraugen hohe Wellen schlagen Das Tosen des Moorwassers konne sogar Erdbeben die in weiter Ferne stattfinden anzeigen

A chuspas which is Quechua for bag)is a pouch that is used to carry coca and cocoa leaves used primarily in the Andean region of South America Both textiles and coca are very important to the people in Andean South America These chuspas are a vital piece of culture and are especially important to combat the bitter cold in the mountainous zones of the Andes These bags are also a way to showcase the cloth which in itself is a primary artistic medium Highland textiles are traditionally woven from the hair of native camelids usually the domesticated alpacas and llamas and more rarely wild vicuna and guanaco These pouches are important symbols of social identity As part of this tradition chuspas show to the rest of their people how skilled they are in weaving They can express their artistic skills and display their cultural affiliation by creating these chuspas
History
Since the beginning of the first millennium AD chuspas have been a constant presence in Andean society Chuspas have endured changing fashions and technologies throughout the years just like other pieces of fashion Furthermore as with other textiles in Andean South America stylistic differences between chuspas distinguish them as products of particular regions and communities However chuspas are unique among Andean textiles because of the substance they hold coca leaves
Long before the Spanish arrived in Peru Andean artists portrayed people wearing chuspas especially on pottery vessels Between AD1 and 700 the Moche dominated the north coast of Peru and during that time Moche ceramic artists produced lifelike representations of people plants and animals in molded ceramic vessels Many of these representations depicted people carrying chuspas
Depictions of chuspas in media have been around since pre-Hispanic times Chuspas are particularly notable in the seventeenth century line drawings that accompany Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala's length description of Inca customs Guaman Poma includes chuspas in an extensive variety of contexts as two individuals share coca during horticulture in ritual settings at funerals in festivals and in parades
Written descriptions of Andean chuspas or huallqepos as they are called in Aymara another widely spoken Andean language are also remarkably consistent from the Spanish conquest to present In 1609 Bernabe Cobo wrote that underneath his mantle and over his tunic a man would carry a small chuspa which hangs around the neck It is more or less one span in length and about the same width This bag hangs down by the waist under the right arm and the strap from which it hangs passes over the left shoulder There have been many visual and written representations of chuspas throughout the centuries which demonstrate the ubiquity of chuspas and suggest that coca bags are relatively straight forward and conservative items but in fact variations are evident in the actual objects that have survived Surviving chuspas reveal a great deal about the technological and artistic styles evident in the Andes at different periods
Crafting Chuspas
Chuspas are created using similar tools and techniques involved in making larger items such as shawls and ponchos Although the technologies are relatively simple creating a chuspas can take more than a week and for a much smaller object
The crafting process incorporates three basic stages spinning weaving and embellishing Using a hand spindle a weaver spins coton camelid fiber or sheep's wool into a thread and then twists or piles two or more spun threads together to strengthen the yarn When she has spun and piled enough yarn the weaver turns to her loom Horizontal ground looms are particularly common in the southern Andes where most of the chuspas are made Once the weaver has wraped the loom by continuously wrapping a length of yarn in a figure-eight around the bars at each end of the loom she can begin to interlace the weft threads into the warp to create a structure Although plain weave is the simplest and most common weavers use a range of more complex weaving techniques in order to achieve the elaborate designs seen in chuspas and other Andean cloth
Regardless of the technique used after the weaver is finished she removes the loom pieces and is left with a four-selvage length of cloth which is folded in half and stitched along the sides to create the basic bag shape of a shuspa Although simple stitching is seen in some coca bags weavers often create a tubular edging to ensure that the sides are more securely held together This is achieved by extracting either a cross-knit loop stitch or hand-woven edge bindings When the body of the bag is complete the weaver adds straps To finish the weaver sews on tassels fringes eads and other decorations according to local custom

Siege of Novo Brdo 1440?41

The Siege of Novo Brdo was a military blockade of Novo Brdo an important fortified mining town in the Serbian Despotate by the forces of the Ottoman Empire beginning in 1440 and lasting until the capture of the fortress on 27 June 1441 During the siege the Serbian garrison was supported by the local community of citizens of the Republic of Ragusa
Background
Fall of Smederevo and siege of Belgrade
In 1439 the Ottoman forces led by the sultan Murad II attacked Serbian Despotate Serbian despot ?ura? Brankovi? fled to Hungary to seek support for the defense of his realm organized by his son Grgur Smederevo was the capital and the most important city of the Serbian Despotate
During the siege of Smederevo in 1439 Sultan Murad II ordered the marcher-lord Ishak-Beg who was on his return from Mecca to join forces of Had?m ?ehabeddin and besiege Novo Brdo On 6 August 1439 the Ottoman forces under Ishak-Beg defeated forces of Serbian Despotate in a battle fought near Novo Brdo The Ottomans captured Smederevo on 18 August 1439 which reduced the territory of the Serbian Despotate under ?ura? Brankovi? to Zeta and a region around Novo Brdo The forces under Murad II joined Ishak-Beg to attack Novo Brdo but its garrison successfully repelled their attacks The Ottomans realized that it would be difficult for them to capture well-defended Novo Brdo so Murad II order Ottoman forces to retreat and stay in Skopje during the winter Before they did so they robbed caravans of Ragusan merchants while Murad went to Adrianople The Ottomans allowed Grgur Brankovi? to govern his father's former estates in southern Serbia as Ottoman vassal When Ottomans captured Smederevo on 18 August 1439 the only remaining territory under suzerainty of the Serbian Despotate consisted of Zeta and the region around the fortified mining town Novo Brdo because Brankovi? ceded Belgrade to Hungary in 1427 During Spring and Summer of 1440 the Ottomans again besieged Belgrade but without success although they used cannons cast in Smederevo captured a year before
Siege of Novo Brdo 1439
Novo Brdo was one of the largest cities in the Balkans Because of its rich gold and silver mines Novo Brdo was the most important non-coastal city in the Balkans in the 14th and 15th centuries The Ottomans unsuccessfully besieged it in 1412 and in 1427 when they used canons constructed for the 1422 siege of Constantinople In 1439 the Ottomans again unsuccessfully besieged Novo Brdo
Siege of Novo Brdo 1440
In 1440 after their defeat during the siege of Belgrade the Ottoman forces commanded by Had?m ?ehabeddin a beylerbey of the Rumelia Eyalet again besieged Novo Brdo The garrison in Novo Brdo was under the command of Voivode Prijezda
Ragusan citizens were to be found all over the Serbian Despotate while in Novo Brdo they had a flourishing merchant community The Republic of Ragusa instructed its citizens in Novo Brdo to participate in the resistance of the besieged town Therefore the garrisoned forces of Serbian Despotate were also supported by the citizens of the Republic of Ragusa which had important role in the defense of Novo Brdo Ragusans who were predominantly merchants were practically forced to resist the Ottomans because otherwise their property in Novo Brdo would be confiscated like it was in the case of Ragusan merchants who happened to be outside of the town when the siege began and refused to return to it
Despot ?ura? Brankovi? and his wife traveled from Hungary to Zeta accompanied with several hundred cavalry and voivode Peter Spani of the Spani family They first went to Zagreb to ?ura?'s sister Katarina who was the wife of Ulrich II Count of Celje Then Brankovi? arrived to Dubrovnik at the end of July 1440 and after several days he continued his journey toward his coastal towns of Budva and Bar which became the new capital of the remaining part of his despotate In the period between 1 July 1440 and Despots arrival to Bar the Ottoman forces defeated some military units from Novo Brdo in a battle near Makre? a village near modern-day Gnjilane
In August 1440 Brankovi? arrived to Bar where he stayed until the end of the winter 1440/1441 There he tried to mobilize forces to recapture the territory of the Serbian Despotate he lost to the Ottomans At the same time Brankovi? maintained communication with the garrison in Novo Brdo and his son Grgur who at the time was an Ottoman governor That was one of the main reasons why the Ottomans probably justifiably accused Grgur for treason and dismissed him from his governorship in April 1441 On 8 May 1441 both Grgur and his brother Stefan were blinded based on the order of Sultan Murad II Brankovi? faced another disappointment in Zeta where he found out that the Crnojevi?i rebelled against Duke Komnen the governor of Zeta Brankovi? left Zeta in April 1441 and resided in Dubrovnik for a while This angered Ottomans who requested through their envoy Agub that Dubrovnik should hand over Brankovi? Ragusans refused this request and explained in a letter to Ishak-Beg and Had?m ?ehabeddin that Dubrovnik has not accepted Brankovi? because he was an enemy of the sultan but because Dubrovnik is a free city that accepts anybody who seeks shelter in it They also emphasized that Brankovi? being in Dubrovnik is the best guarantee that he would not undertake any action against the Ottomans Ragusans wanted to send their diplomats to Had?m ?ehabeddin and requested his written guarantee for their safe conduct On 13 June 1441 Had?m ?ehabeddin who was in Vu?itrn at the time issued the requested guarantee to the Ragusans
During the siege of Novo Brdo its population suffered heavy casualties On 27 June 1441 Novo Brdo surrendered to the Ottoman forces who then robbed and burned the captured town
Aftermath
?ura? Brankovi? received the news about the fall of Novo Brdo when he was in Zeta Stephen Vuk?i? who was an Ottoman vassal at that time used weak position of the Serbian Despot and tried to capture Zeta After he successfully penetrated into Zeta highlands Venetian Republic captured Zeta's coastal cities and regions based on agreement with despot Brankovi? that they will protect his possessions from falling under Ottoman control Brankovi? realized that he lost all of his territory and power base which supplied him with troops necessary to secure his suzerainty so he moved to his estates in Hungary Eventually Zeta fell under control of the local tribes with the Crnojevi?i noble family trying to assert their dominance The Ottomans made significant efforts to again raise Novo Brdo and gave substantial privileges to people who settled in it and worked in its mines while its Serb citizens were awarded with trading privileges Within next three years the Ottomans re-established the mint in Novo Brdo which began to strike akce for the first time
In 1444 during the Long Campaign of Crusaders Novo Brdo was recaptured from the Ottomans and again became a part of the reestablished Serbian Despotate until it finally fell to the Ottoman control on 1 June 1455 Among the survivors of the siege was Dimitrije Kantakouzenos In 1455 the Ottomans forced the besieged to surrender because they used heavy artillery All men of any distinguished rank or importance were decapitated under orders of sultan Mehmed II An estimated 320 boys were taken to become janissaries dev?irme Approximately 700 girls and young women were given to Ottoman soldiers and their commanders The siege and its aftermath were described in Memoirs of a janissary written in 1490?1501 by Novo Brdo resident Konstantin Mihailovi? who was one of the boys taken

Nach Bach

Nach Bach German for After Bach subtitled Fantasia for harpsichord is a composition for harpsichord or piano by American composer George Rochberg written in 1966 and dedicated to his friend Igor Kipnis who premiered the work in Annenberg Auditorium at the University of Pennsylvania on 27 January 1967
History
Rochberg composed this piece while still serving as chairman of the music department at the University of Pennsylvania He had just abandoned serialism three years previously in 1963 the year before his father died in the spring and in November of the same year his teenage son Paul died because of brain tumor The composer said it was after his son died that He also said he had found serialism to be a style incapable of expressing serenity tranquility grace wit energy and perhaps most importantly joy His last serial work was the Trio for violin cello and piano written in 1963
Rochberg composed the work at Tanglewood in the summer of 1966 on a commission from the harpsichordist Igor Kipnis At the time Rochberg knew virtually nothing about the technical problems of the harpsichord so be fore setting to work had a long discussion with Kipnis who demonstrated the use of pedals the attack and timbral characteristics of the instrument which enabled the composer to incorporate every possible color combination available on Kipnis's custom-built instrument into the structure of the piece The manuscript score is dated July 6 1966 and at that point was designated only for the harpsichord The score was revised for publication to include registration markings for the harpsichord added by the dedicatee Igor Kipnis and accommodations for performance on the piano including dynamic markings indications for pedaling and ossia passages on pages 4.1 4.2 and 8.2 in which some notes are to be played an octave higher on the piano than in the version for harpsichord
Structure
This work is in free form like many other fantasias with long sections with durations in unmeasured notation The composer describes this form as open asymmetrical and progressive i.e non-repetitive and so akin in spirit at least to the old fantasia idea of Bach and Mozart quoted in In the score according to the composer passages marked in boxes are direct quotes from J S Bach's Partita No 6 in E Minor BWV 830 and should be played as dramatic inserts In addition to these direct quotations all of which occur in the second of its five main sections there are many non-literal quotations and pitch segments derived from Bach's composition There is also a quotation from a Brahms Intermezzo on the last page
The general texture of the work is freely atonal with rhythms written in indeterminate notation One of the most striking features of the work is the contrast between this predominant texture and the quotations from Bach A free-form composition with an improvisatory character the work nevertheless falls into five large sections with a transitional passage between sections two and three The sections are discriminated by the use of strong cadences long pauses and changes in texture density tempo mood and dynamics Dissonances are also used to differentiate the sections
Although it does not employ twelve-tone technique several twelve-tone sets occur in the piece including one that opens the work B E B C D C E F G A A G which divides into a pair of 1 2 3 4 6 hexachords Many of the main pitch elements of the piece are derived from this set Three further twelve-tone sets occur in the second main section and two in the third


Advanced metrics

Advanced Metrics is the term for the empirical analysis of sports particularly statistics that measure in-game productivity and efficiency Advanced metrics were first employed in baseball by Bill James a pioneer in the field who is considered the father and public face of the practice
General principles
The basic principles of advanced metrics were outlined in The Sabermetric Manifesto by David Grabiner 1994 In the piece Grabiner explains that Bill James defined sabermetrics the first advanced metric as the search for objective knowledge about sports
To glean objective knowledge advanced metrics practitioners gather and synthesize thousands of situational game data points from a wide variety of sources beyond high level box score information A large volume of situational data is then distilled into sophisticated statistics that helps sports enthusiasts better understand compare and appreciate the on-field performances by athletes Advanced metrics provide more objective answers to questions such as which player on the Red Sox contributed the most to the team's offense or who is the best wing player in the NBA or how many touchdowns is Dez Bryant likely to score for the Cowboys By removing the subjective observations of sports media members and the emotional opinions of fans advanced metrics offer a more clinical rational prism from which to enjoy sporting events and consume sports media coverage
Early history
Advanced metrics were first posited in the mid-1900s and Earnshaw Cook was one its earliest practitioners Cook's research for his 1964 work Percentage Baseball was the first publication siting advanced metrics to garner national media attention Despite the competitive advantage offered by advanced metrics the practice was unanimously dismissed by major sports organizations for most of the twentieth century
In the late 1970s Bill James helped bring SABR which stands for the Society for American Baseball Research and the empirical analysis of athletic performance to national prominence The analytical perspective on sports championed by James and SABR developed a wider following after Sports Illustrated featured James in the article He Does It By The Numbers by Daniel Okrent 1981
Advanced metrics in baseball
Former Major League Baseball second baseman Davey Johnson was the first known member of a major sports organization to advocate for the use of advanced metrics During his time with the Baltimore Orioles he used an IBM System/360 to write a FORTRAN baseball computer simulation to determine the team's optimal starting lineup When he proposed his findings to Orioles manager Earl Weaver Johnson's proposal was summarily dismissed A decade later after becoming the New York Mets manager in 1984 Johnson tasked a team employee with writing a dBASE II application to run sophisticated statistical models in order to better understand the capabilities and tendencies of the team's opponents At the close of the twentieth century advanced metrics had gained significant acceptance by the management of many Major League Baseball clubs notably the Oakland A's Boston Red Sox and Cleveland Indians
The adoption of advanced metrics by professional baseball franchises has been largely outpaced by sports fans and sports media Bill James first published his Baseball Abstract in the early 1980s In 1996 Baseball Prospectus sought to built upon Bill James work when it launched the website BaseballProspectus.com in order to present sabermetric research and related findings as well as publish advanced metrics such as EqA the Davenport Translations DT's and VORP Today Baseball Prospectus has grown into a multi-channel sports media organization employing a team of statisticians and writers who publish New York Times Best Selling books and host weekly radio shows and podcasts
Advanced metrics in basketball
North Carolina under coach Frank McGuire was the first known basketball organization to utilized advanced possession metrics to gain a competitive advantage Since then advanced metrics enthusiasts in basketball have borrowed aspects of Bill James philosophy in order to create weighted statistics that measure each player and each team's on-court efficiency Most basketball-specific advanced metrics feature a per-minute measurement to ensure that a player's incremental team contributions are measured irrespective of usage volume
Beginning in the 1990s statistician Dean Oliver and ESPN sports writer John Hollinger first popularized the use of advanced metrics in basketball Oliver's book Basketball On Paper and Hollinger's Pro Basketball Forecast are credited with the advancement of basketball's version of sabermetrics APBRmetrics Major sports media proponents such as Hollinger have helped basketball evolve more quickly from rudimentary statistics to advanced metrics than some other major American sports
Houston Rockets Daryl Morey was the first NBA general manager to implement advanced metrics as a key aspect of player evaluation In the years that followed Morey's hiring the NBA moved quickly to adopt advanced metrics-based player evaluation practices In 2012 John Holliger left ESPN to become VP of Basketball Operations for the Memphis Grizzlies
Beyond professional basketball front offices major sports media websites such as basketballreference.com and hoopsdata.com are now dedicated to the collection synthesis and dissemination of advanced metrics to pro and college basketball organizations sports media members and fans
Advanced metrics in American football
The adoption of advanced metrics by college and professional football organizations has been a gradual evolution While the sabermetrics revolution in baseball has already inspired a bestselling book Moneyball by Michael Lewis which also became a critically acclaimed film the advanced metrics movement in football has had no such prominence
In 2003 the advanced metrics-focused website FootballOutsiders.com pioneered football's first comprehensive advanced metric DVOA defense-adjusted value over average which compares a player's success on each play to the league average based on a number of variables including down distance location on field current score gap quarter and strength of opponent Football Outsiders work has since been widely cited by analytical members the sports media establishment A few years later Pro Football Focus launched a comprehensive statistical database which soon featured a sophisticated player grading system
Grantland lead football writer Bill Barnwell created the first advanced metrics focused on predicting the future performance of an individual player the Speed Score which he referenced in a piece written for Pro Football Prospectus After analyzing data pertaining to running back success Barnwell discovered that the most successful running backs at the NFL level were both fast and heavy therefore Speed Score weights 40-yard dash times by assigning a premium to bigger often stronger running backs
The fantasy football community has been one of the driving forces in the evolution of advanced metrics in American football Fantasy sports writer and author of How To Think Like A Fantasy Football Winner C.D Carter is a leading advocate for the use of advanced metrics in fantasy football analysis He and peers at XN Sports NumberFire and the long-form fantasy football analysis site Rotoviz.com have established an informal subculture of fantasy football sports writers who refer to themselves as degens The degen movement is responsible for the creation of numerous American football efficiency metrics that better explain past football performances and attempt to predict future player production Height-adjusted Speed Score College Dominator Rating Target Premium Catch Radius Net Expected Points NEP and Production Premium were recently created and disseminated by degen writers and mathematicians Building on the work of these writers sites such as PlayerProfiler.com distill a wide variety of established advanced metrics into a single player snapshot designed to be palatable to the casual sports fan

Naomi Feinbrun-Dothan was a botanist who became part of the academic staff at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem She studied the flora of Israel and published dozens of articles and several analytical flora books Just after her 91st birthday she received the 1991 Israel Prize for her unique contribution to the Land of Israel studies
Biography
Naomi Feinbrun was born in Moscow in 1900 her parents Rachel and Aharon Feinbrun belonged to Hovevei Zion and her father was also a member of the Benei Zion association in Moscow She also had an older sister Shulamit and two younger brothers Miron and Moshe
The family lived in Kishinev Bessarabia But the street was not within the Kishinev pogrom boundary She went to an elementary school where she was taught Hebrew for one hour every day Then she went to a Jewish girlsÅf high school in Kishinev In 1907 the family moved to Moscow After finishing high school in 1918 she went to study at Moscow University In 1920 the family moved back to Bessarabia She carried on her studies at the University of Cluj in the Romanian province of Transylvania In 1923 she received her first degree in Botany She then became a teacher at a Jewish girls high school teaching natural sciences
In 1924 the entire Feinbrun family emigrated to Palestine Since Naomi was 24 she could not use her parentsÅf familial immigration certificate Instead a relative helped her by testifying to the authorities that she had been a high-school student at the Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium in Tel Aviv before leaving for Moscow for a few years After receiving a recommendation from Rachel Katznelson Feinbrun started work as a teacher at a school in Tel Adashim in the Jezreel Valley
In 1925 Feinbrun went on a study tour for natural sciences teachers to the Tavor Mountain Guiding the tour was Alexander Eig He encouraged her to do more plant research He became her mentor and colleague It is presumed that one of the factors that Feinbrun never married was due to their close working relationship
In 1926 she attended the Institute of Agriculture and Natural History in Tel Aviv which was directed by Otto Warburg She then accepted the part-time post of guest researcher During this time she studied English mostly using G E PostsÅfs book Flora of Syria Palestine and Sinai Beirut 1898
When the Hebrew University of Jerusalem was founded in April 1925 it was later decided that the Institute of Agriculture and Natural History would be part of the new university Its name was changed to the Systematic Botany Branch with Otto Warburg still the director
In 1929 she became an un-tenured assistant at the University with Alexander Eig and Michael Zohary they moved to Jerusalem In 1931 they produced the first analytical flora book written in Hebrew It was later reprinted in English in 1965
The University started as a research facility without formal teaching The teaching of sciences started in the early 1930s In the Department of Botany genetics was chosen to be one of the six major subjects on the curriculum Due to Feinbrun's cytology work with Hannan Oppenheimer who was engaged in physiological botany in Rehovot Campus of the University
From 1930 to 1938 all her botanic publications were in Hebrew or German and only after 1938 did she start publishing in English
In 1931 she went to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin in order to increase her knowledge of genetics and there she worked in the Department for Hereditary Research
In 1931 Alexander Eig founded the Jerusalem Botanical Gardens on Mount Scopus together with Michael Zohary and Feinbrun
In 1933 Feinbrun joined a delegation of seven Hebrew University scientists who were invited to Iraq by the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture Their main purpose was to conduct a survey of the forests of Kurdistan - preparing an inventory of trees and presenting a proposal for afforestation and for preserving the forests Other research expeditions in which Feinbrun participated were to Transjordan the Sinai Peninsula Lebanon Cyprus and in 1944 to the eastern desert in Egypt
In 1935 she spent two and a half months in the laboratory of Professor Alexandre Guilliermond at the Sorbonne University in Paris When she returned to Palestine she began teaching genetics and cytology Until the 1950s she was the only one who taught a course in genetics at the Hebrew University
In 1936 Eig established the Palestine Journal of Botany Jerusalem It later in 1951 became the Israel Journal of Botany and then in 1994 Israel Journal of Plant Sciences In which Feinbrun and her colleagues used to publish their works The first issue of the journal included a phytographic map based on the three researchersÅf many field trips
During this time she worked on her doctoral dissertation ÅgMonography study of the genus Bellevalia,Åh studying the number and form of chromosomes and using them in the systematic classification of this plant genus Under the supervision of Dr Eig It was published in the Palestine Journal of Botany
In 1938 at the age of 44 Dr Alexander Eig passes away After his death his two assistants Michael Zohary and Naomi Feinbrun continue his work of cultivating the Mount Scopus Botanical Garden
Also in 1938 she received her Ph.D degree but was promoted from instructor to lecturer eventually in 1952 She devoted her full attention to the study of local and Middle Eastern species mostly grown in her experimental plots and investigated cytotaxonomically a branch of taxonomy in which characteristics of cellular structures particularly of somatic chromosomes are used to classify organisms
After 1947 when the state of Israel was established she and her brothers Hebraized their family name and she became Naomi Feinbrun-Dothan
In 1953 Feinbrun spent a sabbatical year at the herbarium at Kew Gardens in London and also the herbariums of Edinburgh and Geneva In 1960 she became an associate professor of the University She joined Elisabeth Oldschmidt Tscharna Rayss and Hanna Rozin in various fields of biology and medicine who were the only three women of that rank in the University
In 1960 she wrote Wild plants in the land of Israel
In 1966 with Zohary Michael she wrote Flora Palaestina Part 1 Equisetaceae to Moringaceae Part 2 Platanaceae to Umbelliferae Part 3 Ericaceae to Compositae Jerusalem Academy of Sciences and Letters 1966-79 Textvolumes and Plate volumes
In the 1970s several bulbs of an unknown Colchicum were given to her to study She identified it as a Greek species called Colchicum bowlesianum Later the bulbs were re-investigated by Karin Persson and were then classed as a separate species She described the bulbs as a new species in the Israeli Journal of Plant Science She named it Colchicum feinbruniae after Prof Naomi Feinbrun who had passed away in the meantime
In 1978 and 1986 she wrote Flora Palestinea Parts 2 and 3 Which were follow ups of
Flora Palestinea Parts 1 1966 and Part 2 1972 written by M Zohary
In 1986 this book obtained her a gold medal from Optima Organization for the Phyto-Taxonomic Investigation of the Mediterranean area the International Organization of Mediterranean Sea botanists
In 1991 she wrote with Avinoam Danin a new and updated analytical flora book This became one of her most important pieces of work
She won the Israel Prize Land of Israel Studies in 1991
On the 8 March 1995 Naomi Feinbrun-Dothan died just before her ninety-fifth birthday
She is the botanical author of Allium truncatum Allium dumetorum and Iris regis-uzziae

Bhaskar Save

Bhaskar Hiraji Save born 27 January 1922 known in India as the Gandhi of natural farming is an educator entrepreneur farmer and activist
Biography
Bhaskar Save was born in the coastal village of Dehri India on the Arabian Sea into a family belonging to the Wadval community of farm tenders His early years were spent in Dehri at that time a small city in Valsad District in the state of Gujurat where modern conveniences like electricity did not yet exist Farming was a natural integral part of life changing according to the season but regulated by the monsoon which signaled the beginning of a new production season
As a child Bhaskar Save learned the value of cooperation Like most other local farmers SaveÅfs family grew mainly rice pulses and some vegetables People often worked together on each other's fields when extra hands were needed to transplant or harvest a paddy field
Often he accompanied his father on bullock cart trips through forests to neighboring areas After encountering the Warli tribe he was fascinated by their way of life and culture and particularly awed by their belief that God lived in green trees Among the Warli trees were never cut down till they dried and shed all trace of green from their body It was an idea that struck a chord and was to be applied in his own farming career since the planting of tree crops was not a part of his family's traditional agricultural practices
His formal education included Standard 7 of the old system equivalent to class 10 today followed by two years of work towards the Primary Training Certificate This qualified him to teach in a secondary school in a neighboring village which he did for 10 years
On 2 February 1951 Bhaskar Save married Maltiben who has since been his companion The same year the Save family began digging their well By 1952 the well was completed and a waterwheel was constructed After harvesting their monsoon rice the family grew irrigated winter vegetables And for the first time in his life Bhaskar Save used chemical fertilizer together with dung manure ? for his vegetable plants And in 1953 he used chemicals for his rain-fed rice paddy as well
The harvest he reaped attracted attention from a director of the Gujarat State Fertilizer Corporation who offered Save an agency contract for marketing their chemical fertilizer His job included instructing farmers in its use for which he was promised a commission of Rs 5 on every bag of the chemicals he sold Soon Save was recognized as a model farmer for his use of the new technology Several agricultural scientists from Pune and elsewhere drew on his experience for conducting their field trials
By 1954-55 Save had already earned enough money to buy one hectare of land suitable for growing rice to begin his own family farm This was the first of the plots purchased on which today stands the Save family's Kalpavruksha farm now a 6 hectare orchard in Umbergaon region a coastal zone of South Gujarat
By 1956 Save reverted to his father's traditional farming methods However inspired by both the writings of Gandhi and Vinoba Bhave particularly an article by Vinoba on farming practices of certain adivasis he decided to revert to an organic system on one paddy for experimentation This called for changing the impounded water several times in one plot during pauses in the monsoon rains without using any chemicals This too was successful
Though his yield declined the first year so did his expenses and gradually he converted more acreage which he reserved entirely for organic experimentation Organic methods of crop rotation the planting of un-irrigated pulse legumes like beans Bengal moong and so on after harvesting his organic rice were implemented He found that winter pulses which supplied an abundance of atmospheric nitrogen in the soil grew entirely on the sub-soil moisture still present from the recent monsoon When the pulses were harvested cattle were allowed to browse the crop residue in the field thereby recycling their manure to condition the soil as well
In 1957 Bhaskar Save built a small home on his new now present farm which had grown to two hectares and moved there with his family Raising an orchard was now his major preoccupation and he wanted to spend more time working and observing By 1960 he had completely eliminated the use of chemicals on his farm
Save's Philosophy of Natural Farming
Bhaskar Save developed his system of natural farming after being induced to use chemical fertilizers which after three years he realized was not returning value to him or his land He later commented that By ruining the natural fertility of the soil we actually create artificial needs for more and more external inputs and unnecessary inputs for ourselves while the results are inferior and more expensive in every way
The concept and practice of Natural Farming was pioneered by Masanobu Fukuoka of Japan who visited Save at his Kalpavruksh farm in 1997 as a special guest to commemorate India's 50 years of independence led by Mahatma Gandhi While both men depended on tree crops for the sustainability of their farms Save organized his own vision of natural farming far more aggressively around the active irrigation of his tree crops supplemented by grains vegetables and livestock as did Fukuoka Save is credited with pioneering the platform and trench system to provide water to his tree crops storing moisture in the soil year round In the beginning in order to sustain his farm until the long-life fruit trees matured and yielded value he integrated short medium and long-life plant species into his early scheme to rapidly establish complete ground cover and optimize yield Briefly Save's polyculture plant categories and natural farming philosophy are based on this pattern
Save's idea for platforms resulted from a need to grow trees on low-lying paddy fields To elevate the land he constructed raised earthen mounds or berms and was then able to plant his saplings.Initially he simply broaden the berms between his rice plots depending solely on the monsoon rains for moisture Later he was granted permission by the village panchayat to excavate at his own expense a village pond on some uncultivated common land near his farm The soil that was dug out ? as the pond was gradually enlarged and deepened each year ? further served to elevate and expand his platforms for the trees
Initially the saplings of coconut or chikoo long life-span species were intercropped only with vegetables short life-span species Later Bhaskar Save integrated other crops like bananas and papayas medium life-span among his chikoos and coconuts ? to optimize the use of the available sunlight until the long-life trees matured and cast thick shade on the ground Today 90% of the family's income is earned from chikoo and coconut production
In 2006 Bhaskar Save published an ÅgOpen LetterÅh to the Minister of Agriculture and other top officials to bring attention to the mounting suicide rate and debt among farmers and to encourage them to abandon their policies of importing and promoting the use of toxic chemical fertilizers that were a source of the problem
Recognition
Beyond the many awards that Bhaskar Save has received his reworking of an ancient trench and platform system for irrigated fruit trees like banana chikoo and coconut has been recognized by the United Nations 2001 and others as one of most important orchard production systems in the world Other achievements include


Third Tikal-Calakmul War

The Third Tikal-Calakmul War was the third in a series of wars between Tikal and Calakmul Tikal-Calakmul Wars two of the Major superpowers of the Maya Civilization during the classic period
During the third war the vassal state of Quirigua played an important role when it declared independence from Copan Tikal's closest ally in the south and then allied itself with Calakmul
Before Quirigua
After Calakmuls defeat in 695 9.13.2.14.19 on the Maya calendar violence continued between it and Tikal but for the most part died down
Then again in 720 9.14.8.3.9 conflicts slowly started up
Despite Tikal being more prosperous Naranjo Dos Pilas and El Peru remained under Calakmul's control
Between 733 and 736 Tikal imprisoned a noble from Calakmul after a victorious battle His capture was commemorated by the building of an altar that has a sculpture of him bound by Tikal soldiers
Quirigua's revolution
Quirigua was a small city in the south of the Maya area it would eventually grow to house 16,000 people
The city had long been a vassal of the larger Copan In 724 9.14.12.4.10 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil Ajaw of Copan installed K'ak Tiliw Chan Yopaat as regional ruler of Quirigua
In 734 at Altar M in Quirigua KÅfak Tiliw Chan Yopaat gave himself the title kÅfuhul ajaw thus declaring QuiriguaÅfs independence from Copan
This lead to a four year revolutionary war
It was two years later in 736 9.15.4.7.13 that Wamaw K'awiil and several ambassadors from Calakmul met with KÅfak Tiliw Chan Yopaat
On April 27 738 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was captured by K'ak Tiliw Chan Yopaat Due to there having been no major battles around copan or Quirigua it has been concluded that he was probably not captured in battle
On 3 May 738 9.15.6.14.6 after a public trial and during a ritual Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was decapitated by an axe thus event is recorded in history as an axe event
After Quirigua's revolution
Though Quirigua was to a certain extent a vassal of Calakmul it was never directly under Calakmul's control At the same time Copan never attempted to re conquer Quirigua because its leaders were afraid of the military power of Calakmul The alliance was mutually beneficial to Quirigua and Calakmul Quirigua's importance was mainly due to its position on several major trade routes
in 743 El Peru was taken by Tikal and in 744 Naranjo was take destroying Calakmuls once powerful and extensive network of allies vassal states and trade networks
Aftermath
After 790 Calakmul lost most of its northern territories to nations on the Yucatan Peninsula
In 810 three stele were raised in Calakmul
March 20 829 is 9.19.19.0.0 on the Maya calendar the beginning of a new Winal because of this normally new stele would have been raised but none were In 899 possibly 909 the last stele record was raised in Calakmul After this a few more stele were raised but don't appear to be actual writing just imitations from people trying to keep Maya civilization from collapse
This was part of the Maya Collapse Tikal and most of the other major cities of the time also experienced an extreme population decrease

Parc de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge

The Parc de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge formerly known as the Square de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge is a public park in the 19th arrondissement of Paris which was created in 1939 It is an example of 1930s modernist park design and contains a fountain and works of sculpture from the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne 1937 held at the Trocadero
The park is located between the Boulevard d'Algerie Boulevard Serurier and avenue Debidour The nearest Metro station is Pre-Saint-Gervais
History
The Parc was built on a wide strip of land around the edge of the city which had been set aside as a military zone in the 1840s Some Paris architects and planners had called for transforming the entire zone around the city into a continuous park but that plan was abandoned and only a small amount of the zone was dedicated to green space
The new park was designed by the architect Leon Azema a classically trained architect who had won the Prix de Rome in 1921 along with his colleagues Jacques Carlu and Louis-Hippolyte Boileau who had all worked together on the hillside and fountains of Palais de Chaillot for the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne 1937
The park marked a major departure for the garden designs of Paris Since 1855 all the new parks and gardens of Paris had been designed or re-designed by Jean-Charles Alphand the first first chief of Paris Promenades and Plantations under Emperor Napoleon III from 1855 until 1870 and then Director of Public Works of Paris from 1871 until his death in 1891 or by the pupils of Alphand and they all followed the same basic picturesque style with groves of trees flowerbeds winding paths kiosks and follies Azema's style was more classical with wide open lawns highlighting works of sculpture and the groves of trees serving mainly as a background He used the park to showcase several works of modern sculpture
Features of the park
The park has an area of 4.68 hectares and is built on a hillside which offers a fine view of the city from the top The moderne-style buffet d'eau at the entrance on Boulevard d'Algerie on the lower end of the park has a statue of Eve 1938 which had been displayed at the 1937 exposition by Raymond Couvegne a winner of the prix de Rome
Two stairways and two long alleys climb the hillside from the entrance on either side of a large lawn and two spiral paths lead up to two belvederes surrounded by groves of trees which offer views of the city Other paths lead to a terrace higher in the park which also offers a panoramic view A group of three statues two women and a child with grapes by Pierre Traverse 1938 decorates the hillside lawns in the fashion of statues in the classical gardens of the 18th century The park also has two large playgrounds one with neo-classical columns The architecture in the park is in the decorative style of the 1930s using bricks combined with cement encrusted with pebbles

On 1 July 1903 the Adelaide Rifles became the 10th Infantry Regiment and Weir was appointed as adjutant before being promoted to major on 1 January 1904 and appointed as regimental second-in-command On 22 June 1908 Weir was promoted to lieutenant colonel and was appointed as the commanding officer of the 10th Infantry Regiment On 1 January 1912 he was transferred to the unattached list but this only lasted until 1 July 1912 when the universal training scheme was introduced He was soon appointed to command the 19th Infantry Brigade and on 9 September 1913 he was promoted to colonel
World War I
On 5 August 1914 the day confirmation was received in Adelaide of the British declaration of war against the Central Powers Weir was promoted to colonel in the British forces On 12 August he received a telegram from Colonel Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan the designated commander of the 3rd Brigade offering him the command of the 10th Battalion Weir promptly accepted and on 17 August was appointed as a lieutenant colonel in the Australian Imperial Force AIF making him the first South Australian to be commissioned in the AIF He was also made an honorary colonel
Weir assembled and trained his battalion at Morphettville Racecourse then embarked with them on the transport Ascanius on 20 October 1914 On arrival in Fremantle six companies of the 11th Battalion were embarked on the transport and Weir was appointed Officer Commanding Troops for the voyage The battalion began disembarking at Alexandria on 6 December 1914 and were entrained for Cairo where they began to set up camp at Mena The 3rd Brigade was selected as the covering force for the Landing at Anzac and the 10th Battalion embarked for the Greek island of Lemnos in the northern Aegean Sea on 1 March 1915 After further training on Lemnos the battalion was one of the first two battalions ashore on the morning of 25 April 1915 Weir landed with the scout platoon and immediately urged the men of both the 9th Battalion and his own battalion to immediately begin climbing the cliffs that overlooked the beach Weir was the only commanding officer from the 3rd Brigade to go forward of the first ridge and a ridge running off the 400 plateau was subsequently known as Weir Ridge Within five days half of Weir's battalion had been killed or wounded

Later life
Weir had two significant advantages in his return to a civilian career Firstly he was repatriated well before most servicemen and South Australia had implemented a policy of preferment of returned servicemen for government employment His appointment as the first South Australian Public Service Commissioner in 1916 resulted from these advantages Weir was not suited to this role being unable to navigate the competing personal and political agendas of senior public servants and politicians and was soon sidelined On 8 June 1923 after many years of poor health his wife Rosa died In 1925 legislative changes made it possible for the government to replace Weir which occurred in 1930 In 1926 he married Lydia Maria Schrapel In the last year-and-a-half before his retirement in 1931 Weir was the chairman of both the Central Board of Health and the Public Relief Board excelling at the latter

Coliseum?Oakland International Airport line

The Coliseum?Oakland International Airport line also known informally as BART to OAK Airport is an automated guideway transit AGT system operated by Bay Area Rapid Transit BART between BART's Coliseum Station and Oakland International Airport The system opened for public service on November 22 2014 and is integrated into BARTÅfs fare system During planning and construction it was known as the Oakland Airport Connector OAC project and was expected to cost approximately $484 million
Overview
The BART to Oakland International Airport AGT system replaces the former AirBART shuttle bus service Initially operating between two terminal stations the system includes provisions for a third intermediate station Doolittle Station that may be built at a later date
Fares
On June 12 2014 the BART Board of Directors voted to set the base fare for travel on the BART to Oakland International Airport AGT system at $6 The Board left open the possibility that temporary promotional fares could be introduced in the future In addition seniors people with disabilities and children age 12 and under will be eligible for BART's 62.5% discount Subject to approval BART staff planned to recommend at a later Board meeting that airport employees continue to pay a discounted fare of $2.00 for the trip on the new service
Operations
The Coliseum?Oakland International Airport AGT system is operated by BART and is integrated into BARTÅfs existing fare system However it does not utilize existing BART rolling stock and it is not physically connected with existing BART tracks Instead it has its own fleet of AGT vehicles that operate on fixed guideways and are cable-drawn The guideways and Cable Liner vehicles were built by DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car The line is designed to have an approximate headway of 4.5 minutes though it is currently operated with a headway of 5 minutes and to complete a one-way trip in approximately 8 minutes with an on-time performance of more than 99.5%
Initially there will be four 3-car trains 113 passengers each train but the system can accommodate an expansion to four 4-car trains 148 passengers each train The system uses a pinched-loop configuration with two tracks that switch down to a single track just before each terminus Cars switch cables during dwell time at the station
The AGT route between Oakland Coliseum Station and the airport is mostly elevated largely in the median of Hegenberger Road with one underground section as it passes under Doolittle Drive and one at-grade section just west of that point before the AGT enters airport property on an elevated guideway A maintenance and storage facility is located near the midpoint of the system A two-person team monitors operation of the system from a central control room
The AGTÅfs connection to the existing BART system at Coliseum Station resembles the AirTrain JFK and AirTrain Newark airport people movers existing off-airport connections to other rail transit lines In this case however both the airport people mover and connecting rail transit will be operated by BART and share the same fare system The AGT's platform at Coliseum Station connects to the south end of the original BART platform via an elevated walkway above San Leandro Street
Funding
The $484 million for funding the project came from local government funds $275 million 57% state funds $79 million 16% federal funds $25 million 5% and BART deficit spending $106 million 22%
In late 2009 just prior to the award of the contract to construct the system the project lost $70 million of federal stimulus funding because the Federal Transit Administration FTA found that BART was out of conformance with Title VI Among other non-OAC considerations the FTA cited that BART did not complete the necessary analysis to determine if the future change in service would disproportionately impact low-income or minority communities The FTA forced the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to reallocate the funding
By September 2010 all necessary federal and state funding for the OAC had been re-established and a groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 20
Alternatives
Trips between the BART station and Oakland Airport can also be made on AC Transit Route 73 AC Transit is cheaper at $2.10 with additional discounts for those transferring Route 73 runs every 15?minutes daily which is much less frequent than BART to OAK AGT service and is less frequent than even the former AirBART bus service used to be Although Route 73 makes several local stops total trip time is only slightly longer The airport connection provided by Route 73 is not emphasized signage and information is the same as the other AC Transit routes serving the station However use of Route 73 is advised by BART on those days in which the BART to OAK AGT service is non-operational
AC Transit route 805 is also available late at night after BART service ends This route provides service to downtown Oakland where All Nighter connections are available


Five Nights at Freddy's

Five Nights at Freddy's is a 2014 indie point-and-click survival horror video game developed by Scott Cawthon The game centers on the fictional pizza restaurant Freddy Fazbear's Pizza where the player must act as a night security guard defending themself from the malfunctioning animatronic animal characters by tracking their movement through the facility using security cameras
Five Nights at Freddy's was first released via Desura on August 8 2014 On August 20 2014 after it was approved by the service's crowdsourcing platform Greenlight Five Nights at Freddy's was also released via Steam Ports have been released for Android iOS and Windows Phones
The game was praised by critics for being a unique take on the survival horror genre with a particular emphasis on its simplistic design along with how its gameplay mechanics and aesthetics contributed to an overall feeling of fear and paranoia Five Nights at Freddy's was the top-selling game on Desura for the week ending August 18 2014 and the game became the subject of a number of popular Let's Play videos on YouTube The game's sequel Five Nights at Freddy's 2 was released November 11 2014
Gameplay
The player must survive their shift lasting from midnight to approximately 8 to 9 minutes of real time 4-5 minutes on the mobile and tablet editions without being attacked by one of the animatronic animal robots roaming the facility The player who sits in an office and is unable to move is given access to a network of security cameras throughout the facility to track the movement of the animatronic robots Four of the five characters have distinct movement patterns however most of the characters movements take place off-screen The camera feeds are dimly lit and distorted one of the rooms only contains an audio feed and the cameras do not cover certain areas of the building most notably the two hallways directly to the left and right of the player The player cannot leave the guard room but can close the doors to defend themselves and briefly turn on lights in the hallways to check for animatronics Use of these actions consume the player's limited electrical power if the power runs out the cameras become inoperable the doors open and the lights go out leaving the player with no defense against an attack
As the title suggests the game has five levels comprising five nights in the game which increase in difficulty Completion of the game unlocks an even more difficult 6th Night level and completion of this level opens up a Custom Night level editor where the player can adjust the AI difficulty of the individual characters
Plot
The main character whose name is later revealed to be Mike Schmidt has started a job working as a night watch security guard at the restaurant Freddy Fazbear's Pizza a pastiche of restaurants like Chuck E Cheese's A voicemail message left by Mike's predecessor explains that the animatronic animal characters used at the restaurant?including the titular Freddy Fazbear Bonnie the Bunny Chica the Chicken and Foxy the Pirate Fox?are able to roam freely around it at night because if they were left off for too long their servo motors would lock up He also adds that the characters were no longer allowed to roam freely during the day following an incident referred to as the Bite of 87 which apparently involved the loss of someone's frontal lobe The employee warns the player that if one of the robots encounters a human they will automatically assume that it is a robot that is not in costume yet and forcefully stuff them into a spare mechanical Freddy Fazbear costume killing them in the process
Newspaper clippings in the background of one of the scenes reveal that the restaurant was site to the disappearances of five children whose bodies were never found after a man dressed as one of the animatronics lured them into a back room and was said to have murdered them Later the restaurant received complaints that the animatronics began to smell foul and became stained with blood and mucus around the eyes and mouth with one customer comparing them to reanimated carcasses
Development and release
Five Nights at Freddy's was first released via Desura on August 8 2014 On August 20 2014 after it was approved by the service's crowdsourcing platform Greenlight Five Nights at Freddy's was also released via Steam A port for Android was released on August 27 2014 via Google Play Store On September 11 2014 an iOS port was released The Windows Phone version was published on December 05
Reception
Five Nights at Freddy's received positive reviews from critics Indie Game Magazine praised Five Nights at Freddy's for its simple take on the horror genre noting that its artistic direction and gameplay mechanics contributed to a feeling of brutal tension"?worsened by how a player may be familiar with similar restaurants such as Chuck E Cheese's and that it's an incredibly terrifying experience to try to save yourself from the single jump scare that ends the game In conclusion Five Nights at Freddy's was considered a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying However the game was criticized for taking too long to load when launched
Omri Petitte for PC Gamer gave Five Nights at Freddy's a score of 80 out of 100 commenting that the game took a less-is-more approach to its design and that while the AI isn't some masterwork of procedural unpredictability it would head straight to you and eat your face off or it'll play around like an innocent child before closing in for the kill Your mind will fill in the rest The game's overall atmosphere was praised for emphasizing the fear and suspense of an approaching threat rather than the arrival of the threat itself as in other horror-oriented games However the gameplay of Five Nights at Freddy's was criticized for becoming repetitive once a player masters it as there is not much more to expect beyond managing battery life and careful timing of slamming doors shut so those with steely willpower won't find anything else past the atmosphere of it all Ryan Bates of Game Revolution gave the game a 4.5 out of 5 comparing its camera-oriented gameplay to the 1992 game Night Trap he praised the game's minimalistic presentation with particular emphasis on its audio design and lack of music for contributing to the terror of the game along with the fact that the nervous impulses of its repetitive gameplay would reach almost OCD-type levels adding to the tense environment In conclusion he felt that the game was horror done right but that it was too short
Eurogamer"s Jeffrey Matulef compared the animatronic animals in the game to Weeping Angels ? predatory creatures from the universe of Doctor Who ? due to their ability to only move when they are not being observed Softpedia gave the game 4 out of 5 stars with reviewer Cosmin Anton noting that it drifts away from the classic first-person horror survival titles but that the inability to move combined with the limited power available will make you feel quite helpless in front of those relentless robots that just want to share a bit of their love with you
Five Nights at Freddy's was the top-selling game on Desura for the week ending August 18 2014 and the game became the subject of a number of popular Let's Play videos on YouTube
Sequel
Five Nights at Freddy's 2 was released on Steam on November 11 2014 earlier than the original planned release date of December 25 2014 due to issues with releasing the demo The mobile port for Android was released on November 13 2014 Set in 1987 the sequel has the player as a different security guard than before The game features both brand new enemy characters as well as redesigned and degraded versions of the original four enemy characters from the original game A new mechanic in the game is that the player cannot access doors to close and instead must put on a Freddy Fazbear mask to avoid being killed by the animatronics
In January 2015 a new image was uploaded to Scott Cawthon's website teasing a third entry in the series


List of Owenite communities in the United States

This is a list of Owenite communities in the United States which emerged during a short-lived popular boom during the second half of the 1820s Between 1825 and 1830 more than a dozen such colonies were established in the United States inspired by the ideas of Robert Owen All of these met with economic failure and rapid disestablishment within one or a comparatively few years
The Owenite movement of the 1820s was one of the four primary branches of secular Utopian Socialism in the United States during the 19th Century antedating Fourierism 1843-1850 Icarianism 1848-1898 and Bellamyism 1889-1896
Background
The communitarian ideas of Welsh reformer Robert Owen 1772-1837 were popularized in the United States by his arrival in America in November 1824 Owen had learned that an already established Rappite religious community at Harmony Indiana was for sale and set sail for America with a view acquiring it from the Harmony Society and thereby making it a model for his collectivist plans This initial American community of Owen a tract of 30,000 acres on the Wabash River which included farmland dwellings and factories would be rechristened New Harmony and served as the inspiration for the establishment of other Owenite colonies
The idea of Owenite communities in the United States was boosted by two widely publicized addresses by Owen made before the United States Congress dated February 25 and March 7 1825 The assembled audience included President John Quincy Adams several members of his cabinet the justices of the Supreme Court of the United States and a number of other invited luminaries
Owen was assisted in his development of New Harmony by Philadelphian William Maclure himself a wealthy philanthropist as well as the leading American geologist of the day Other leading American intellectuals directly participated in the project including preeminent zoologist Thomas Say painter Charles Alexandre Lesueur visionary pedagogue Francis Neef and Scottish-born feminist and freethinker Frances Fanny Wright among others
A brief fad followed seeking the realization of Owen's ideas in practice resulting in the formation of over a dozen Owenite communities All of these proved short-lived whether owing to internal dissension or an inability to generate a surplus producing manufactured goods and agricultural products sufficient to retire debts incurred By about 1830 the Owenite movement in America had vanished with little trace the established village of New Harmony having long since converted to operation on an individualistic basis

Gas blending

Gas blending is the process of mixing gases for a specific purpose where the composition of the resulting mixture is specified and controlled
A wide range of applications include scientific and industrial processes food production and storage and breathing gases
Gas mixtures are usually specified in terms of molar gas fraction which is closely approximated by volumetric gas fraction for many permanent gases by percentage parts per thousand or parts per million Volumetric gas fraction converts trivially to partial pressure ratio following Dalton's law of partial pressures Partial pressure blending at constant temperature is computationally simple and pressure measurement is relatively inexpensive but maintaining constant temperature during pressure changes requires significant delays for temperature equalization Blending by mass fraction is unaffected by temperature variation during the process but requires accurate measurement of mass or weight and calculation of constituent masses from the specified molar ratio Both partial pressure and mass fraction blending are used in practice
Applications
Shielding gases for welding
Shielding gases are inert or semi-inert gases used in gas metal arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding to protect the weld area from oxygen and water vapour which can reduce the quality of the weld or make the welding more difficult
Gas metal arc welding GMAW or metal inert gas MIG welding is a process that uses a continuous wire feed as a consumable electrode and an inert or semi-inert gas mixture to protect the weld from contamination
Gas tungsten arc welding GTAW or tungsten inert gas TIG welding is a manual welding process that uses a nonconsumable tungsten electrode an inert or semi-inert gas mixture and a separate filler material
Modified Atmosphere Packaging in the food industry
Modified atmosphere packaging is a technology used to preserve the quality of fresh produce so that it can be sold to markets far away from where it is grown extend the marketing period and help reduce food waste within the cold chain The gas composition used to pack food products depends on the product A high oxygen content helps to retain the red colour of meat low oxygen reduces mould growth in bread and vegetables may require a three-gas mixture
Breathing gas mixtures for diving
A breathing gas is a mixture of gaseous chemical elements and compounds used for respiration The essential component for any breathing gas is a partial pressure of oxygen of between roughly 0.16 and 1.60 bar at the ambient pressure The oxygen is usually the only metabolically active component unless the gas is an anaesthetic mixture Some of the oxygen in the breathing gas is consumed by the metabolic processes and the inert components are unchanged and serve mainly to dilute the oxygen to an appropriate concentration and are therefore also known as diluent gases
Scuba diving
Gas blending for scuba diving is the filling of diving cylinders with non-air breathing gases such as nitrox trimix and heliox Use of these gases is generally intended to improve overall safety of the planned dive by reducing the risk of decompression sickness and/or nitrogen narcosis and may improve ease of breathing
Surface supplied and saturation diving
Gas blending for surface supplied and saturation diving may include the filling of bulk storage cylinders and bailout cylinders with breathing gases but it also involves the mixing of breathing gases at lower pressure which are supplied directly to the diver or to the hyperbaric life-support system Part of the operation of the life-support system is the replenishment of oxygen used by the occupants and removal of the carbon dioxide waste product by the gas conditioning unit This entails monitoring of the composition of the chamber gas and periodic addition of oxygen to the chamber gas at the internal pressure of the chamber
The gas mixing unit is part of the life support equipment of a saturation system along with other components which may include bulk gas storage compressors helium recovey unit bell and diver hot water supply gas conditioning unit and emergency power supply
Medical gas mixtures
The anesthetic machine is used to blend breathing gas for patients under anesthesia during surgery The gas mixing and delivery system lets the anesthetist control oxygen fraction nitrous oxide concentration and the concentration of volatile anesthetic agents
The machine is usually supplied with oxygen O2 and nitrous oxide N2O2)from low pressure lines and high pressure reserve cylinders and the metered gas is mixed at ambient pressure after which additional anesthetic agents may be added by a vaporizer and the gas may be humidified Air is used as a diluent to decrease oxygen concentration In special cases other gases may also be added to the mixture These may include carbon dioxide CO2 used to stimulate respiration and helium He to reduce resistance to flow or to enhance heat transfer
Gas mixing systems may be mechanical using conventional rotameter banks or electronic using proportional solenoids or pulsed injectors and control may be manual or automatic
Chemical production processes
Providing reactive gaseous materials for chemical production processes in the required ratio
Controlled atmosphere manufacture and storage
Protective gas mixtures may be used to exclude air or other gases from the surface of sensitive materials during processing
Examples include melting of reactive metals such as magnesium and heat treatment of steels
Customized gas mixtures for analytical applications
Calibration gases
Calibration gas mixtures are generally produced in batches by gravimetric or volumetric methods
The gravimetric method uses sensitive and accurately calibrated scales to weigh the amounts of gases added into the cylinder Precise measurement is required as inaccuracy or impurities can result in incorrect calibration The container for calibration gas must be as close to per
fectly clean as practicable The cylinders may be cleaned by purging with high purity nitrogen the vacuumed For particularly critical mixtures the cylinder may be heated while being vacuumed to facilitate removal of any impurities adhering to the walls
After filling the gas mixture must be thoroughly mixed to ensure that all components are evenly distributed throughout the container to prevent possible variations on composition within the container This is commonly done by rolling the container horizontally for 2 to 4 hours
Methods
Several methods are available for gas blending These may be distinguished as batch methods and continuous processes
Batch methods
Batch gas blending requires the appropriate amounts of the constituent gases to be measured and mixed together until the mixture is homogenous The amounts are based on the mole or molar fractions but measured either by volume or by mass Volume measurement may be done indirectly by partial pressure as the gases are often sequentially decanted into the same container for mixing and therefore occupy the same volume Weight measurement is generally used as a proxy for mass measurement as acceleration can usually be considered constant
The mole fraction is also called the amount fraction and is the number of molecules of a constituent divided by the total number of all molecules in the mixture For example a 50% oxygen 50% helium mixture will contain approximately the same number of molecules of oxygen and helium As both oxygen and helium approximate ideal gases at pressures below 200 bar each will occupy the same volume at the same pressure and temperature so they can be measured by volume at the same pressure then mixed or by partial pressure when decanted into the same container
The mass fraction can be calculated from the molar fraction by multiplying the molar fraction by the molecular mass for each constituent to find a constituent mass and comparing it to the summed masses of all the constituents The actual mass of each constituent needed for a mixture is calculated by multiplying the mass fraction by the desired mass of the mixture
Partial pressure blending
Also known as volumetric blending This must be done at constant temperature for best accuracy though it is possible to compensate for temperature changes in proportion to the accuracy of the temperature measured before and after each gas is added to the mixture
Partial pressure blending is commonly used for breathing gases for diving The accuracy required for this application can be achieved by using a pressure gauge which reads accurately to 0.5?bar and allowing the temperature to equilibrate after each gas is added
Mass fraction blending
Also known as gravimetric blending This is relatively unaffected by temperature and accuracy depends on the accuracy of mass measurement of the constituents
Mass fraction blending is used where great accuracy of the mixture is critical such as in calibration gases The method is not suited to moving platforms where the accelerations can cause inaccurate measurement and therefore is unsuitable for mixing diving gases on vessels
Continuous processes
Additive
Continuous gas blending is used for some surface supplied diving applications and for many chemical processes using reactive gas mixtures particularly where there may be a need to alter the mixture during the operation or process
Subtractive
These processes start with a mixture of gases usually air and reduce the concentration of one or more of the constituents These processes can be used for the production of Nitrox for scuba diving and deoxygenated air for blanketing purposes

The Skyship 500 was developed from the Aerospace Developments AD500 the sole example of which was effectively the prototype / technology demonstrator for the production Skyship 500
AD500
Aerospace Developments began the design of a new non-rigid airship in the 1970s intended to carry out civil and paramilitary roles such as aerial advertising promotional and pleasure flying surveillance and maritime patrol duties
The AD500 introduced new materials and technology to airship manufacture and operations Materials used in the ship included thin single-ply polyester coated with titanium dioxide-doped polyurethane for the envelope;Kevlar for the cables suspending the gondola from the top of the envelope a Kevlar nose-cone moulded in the same manner as glass-reinforced plastic and a gondola moulded by Vickers?Slingsby from Kevlar-reinforced plastic Other innovations featured in the AD500 included simplified controls and thrust vectoring ducted fans driven by inboard-mounted Porsche engines
Assembly of the prototype AD500 began at No.1 Hangar Cardington in March 1978 but was not flown until 3 February 1979 due to various problems with certification and the power-plant On 8 March 1979 whilst moored outside the hangar a storm blew up unexpectedly preventing the airship from being moved into the hangar The nose cone was damaged and the envelope was deflated using the emergency rip cord
Although regarded as a success Aerovision the major investor in Aerospace Developments pulled the plug and the company went into liquidation on 8 June 1979 Development of the AD500 continued with a new company Airship Developments until it was acquired by Thermo-Skyships Ltd to form Airship Industries to bring the concept to production as the Skyship 500
Skyship 500
With the formation of Airship Industries production of the Skyship 500 could commence and five further airships were produced.-
The Skyship 500 consists of a polyester fabric envelope retaining helium gas and carrying a gondola for the control cabin passenger cabin propulsion systems and ballast fixed and jettison-able The envelope is of a traditional streamlined shape with cruciform tail surfaces which carry control surfaces for roll yaw and pitch The undercarriage consists of a castoring twin wheeled oleo-pneumatic strut at the rear of the gondola with ground handling ropes for ground crew to manoeuvre the airship on the ground The nose-cone of the envelope also carries the mooring point which can connect to a mobile mooring mast
The polyester fabric envelope is coated on the outside with Titanium Dioxide TiO2 loaded Polyurethane to reduce Ultra-Violet degradation and lined with a Polyvinylidene chloride PVDC film bonded to the fabric to minimise Helium He losses
Most other structural components are produced from fibre-reinforced composite materials to reduce weight including Fibre-lam board used to build up the fibre reinforced plastic FRP tail surfaces and control surfaces
The moulded FRP gondola houses the control cabin passenger cabin power-plant systems and ballast both fixed and jettison-able Large windows to the front and sides provide excellent visibility for crew and passengers seated on five individual seats and a three abreast bench seat at the rear Support for the gondola comes from Kevlar cables inside the envelope
Power for the Skyship 500 comes from two converted Porsche 930/10 engines inside the rear of the gondola driving the vectoring Hoffmann ducted reversible-pitch propellers through a converted Westland Lynx tail-rotor gearbox and lateral drive-shafts The pilot and co-pilot seated at the front of the cabin have a full set of instruments and avionics and control the airship through yokes which operate the control surfaces though cables
One of the five production airships was produced as a heavy payload version designated Skyship 500 HL was built using a larger Skyship 600 envelope carrying a Skyship 500 gondola
Operational history
In the years 1980-1990 the 6 Skyship 500 airships were used worldwide not only for advertising but also for security and passenger sky-cruises over major cities Fujifilm arranged the first overseas charter using JA-1003 which was delivered in March 1984
A Skyship 500 was used as a camera and surveillance platform at the Games of the XXIII Olympiad in 1984 at Los Angeles California Later in 1984 G-BIHN was shown to full effect in the James Bond film A View to a Kill
Skyship 500s also carried out Sky-cruises and were used as advertising billboards using light arrays The 1987 Sky-cruise programme offered a schedule of 700 flights in a season from March to October Demand for the programme was so high that all flights were sold out within 72 hours
At least one Skyship 500 G-SKSA was used by the United States Navy at the Naval Air Development Center NADC NAS Patuxent River Maryland


SUPS

In computational neuroscience SUPS for Synaptic Updates Per Second or formerly CUPS Connections Updates Per Second is a measure of a neuronal network performance useful in fields of neuroscience cognitive science artificial intelligence and computer science
Computing
For a processor or computer designed to simulate a neural network SUPS is measured as the product of simulated neurons formula_1 and average connectivity formula_2(synapses per neuron per second
formula_3
Depending on the type of simulation it is usual equal to the total number of synapses simulated
In an asynchronous dynamic simulation if a neuron spikes at formula_4 Hz the average rate of synaptic updates provoked by the activity of that neuron is formula_5 In a synchronous simulation with step formula_6 the number of synaptic updates per second would be formula_7 As formula_6 has to be chosen much smaller than the average interval between two successive afferent spikes which implies formula_9 giving an average of synaptic updates equal to formula_10 Therefore spike-driven synaptic dynamics leads to a linear scaling of computational complexity O(N per neuron compared with the O(N2 in the synchronous case
Records
Developed in the 1980s Adaptive Solutions CNAPS-1064 Digital Parallel Processor chip is a full neural network NNW It was designed as a coprocessor to a host and has 64 sub-processors arranged in a 1D array and operating in a SIMD mode Each sub-processor can emulate one or more neurons and multiple chips can be grouped together At 25?MHz it is capable of 1.28?GMAC
After the presentation of the RN-100 12?MHz single neuron chip at Seattle 1991 Ricoh developed the multi-neuron chip RN-200 It had 16 neurons and 16 synapses per neuron The chip has on-chip learning ability using a proprietary backdrop algorithm It comes in a 257-pin PGA encapsulation and develops 3.0 W max It was capable of 3?GCPS 1?GCPS at 32?MHz
In 1991-97 Siemens developed the MA-16 chip SYNAPSE-1 and SYNAPSE-3 Neurocomputer The MA-16 is a fast matrix-matrix multiplier that can be combined to form systolic arrays It can process 4 patterns of 16 elements each 16-bit with 16 neuron values 16-bit at a rate of 800?MMAC or 400?MCPS at 50?MHz The SYNAPSE3-PC PCI card contains 2 MA-16 with a peak performance of 2560?MOPS 1.28?GMAC 7160?MOPS 3.58?GMAC when using three boards

Cork City Gaol

Cork City Gaol is a former prison located in Cork City Ireland it is now a museum
History
In 1806 an Act of Parliament was passed to allow the building of a new Cork City Gaol to replace the old Gaol at the Northgate Bridge the old Gaol which was nearly 100 years was on a confined site and was overcrowded & unhygienic
The first site chosen for the new prison was at distillery fields but this site was later deemed to be unsuitable because it was prone to flooding
A site on Sunday's Well was eventually chosen its altitude being seen as an advantage for containing Gaol fever
The site its approach roads and perimeters was commenced in 1816 and the building of the prison proper started in 1818
The building was designed by William Robertson of Kilkenny and built by the Deane family
The famous sculptor John Hogan worked on the building as a draughtsman
Description
The new Cork City Gaol opened in 1824 & was reported as being Ågthe finest in 3 kingdomsÅh
In 1870 the west wing was remodelled into a double sided cell wing
City Gaol
When the prison opened in the 1820s it housed both male and female prisoners whose crimes were committed within the city boundary Anyone committing a crime outside that boundary were committed to the County Gaol across the river from the City Gaol near University College Cork
Nineteenth Century
The Fenian Brian Dillon was remanded at Cork City Gaol when he was arrested in September 1865
Women's Gaol City and County
The 1878 General Prisons Ireland Act reorganised the prisons in Cork The Cork City Gaol became a WomenÅfs Gaol for Cork City and Cork County and the Cork County Gaol near UCC became the menÅfs gaol for Cork City and Cork County On the day the change came into effect male prisoners were marched out of the SundayÅfs Well Prison and over to the County Gaol while the women were marched in the opposite direction
Nineteenth Century
Many of the prisoners in the late 19th Century were repeat offenders locked up for what would not today be imprisonable offences for example a woman named Mary Tucker from Rathmore in County Cork was imprisoned at least three times between 1849 and 1908 sometimes for offences such as Obscene Language or Drunkeness
Twentieth Century
During the Irish War of Independence Republican women prisoners were imprisoned in the Gaol
In October 1919 Constance Markievicz the first woman to be elected to the British Parliament was imprisoned at Cork Gaol for making a seditious speech
In January 1919 another member of Cumann na mBan Mary Bowles was imprisoned for arms offences Later that month a Republican prisoner named Dolly Burke escaped from the prison
Civil War
In 1922 and 1923 the prison was opened to male and female Republican anti-treaty prisoners of the Irish Civil War
One of those imprisoned at the time was the writer Frank O'Connor
A spectacular escape was made from the Gaol in November 1923 The escapees were high-value prisoners who had been sent to the Gaol as it was the safest place to hold themÅh Some men had feigned illness on the night preceding the escape A rope ladder was made to scale the outer wall and bed clothes were used to descend to the ground by night After the prisoners had lowered themselves to the ground inside the wall they had to huddle in its shadow in sight of a sentry The position of the moon at a certain hour had to be estimated in order to conceal the movements of the men in the shadows They went in batches of fourteen as that was the number that could fit in the shadow of the wall the most wanted men being given preference in order of the serious nature of their charges All the men in the first batch were liable to the death penalty and cast lots for the order in line When number nine went over the wall some noise attracted the sentry and he made movements which caused the prisoner to balk After a few moments silence the action was resumed and three batches amounting to forty two men escaped with a lapse of fifteen minutes between each batch It was a frosty night and they had to travel in stockinged feet Some of those who escaped were natives of Cork City and got clear of there before daylight but others in the last few batches were recaptured later in the day
The Gaol closed in August 1923 with all remaining prisoners either released or transferred to other prisons
Post 1923
From 1927 the top floor of the Governors house was used as a radio broadcasting station by 6CK the first official radio station in Cork Ireland
6CK was succeeded by a national radio station- Radio Eireann now Raidio Teilifis Eireann and broadcasting continued at the Gaol until the 1950s
Apart from the radio broadcasting and some storage use of the exterior grounds by the Dept Posts & Telegraphs the Gaol complex was allowed to become totally derelict
Museum
The building reopened to the public as a visitor attraction in 1993


Radare2

Radare2 also known as r2 is a complete framework for reverse-engineering and analyzing binaries composed of a set of small utilities that can be used together or independently from the command line Built around a disassembler for computer software which generates assembly language source code from machine-executable code it supports a large number of executable formats for different processors and operating systems
Radare2 performs automatic code analysis using cross-references between code sections and other information However the nature of disassembly precludes total accuracy and a great deal of human intervention is necessarily required This is why it gives great power to the user letting him change every aspect of the analysis
History
It was created in February 2006 aiming to provide a free and simple command line interface for a hexadecimal editor supporting 64 bit offsets to make searches and recovering data from hard-disks for forensic purpose Since then the project has grown with the aim changed to provide a complete framework for analysing binaries with some basic *NIX concepts in mind like everything is a file small programs that interact together using stdin/out or keep it simple
In 2009 the decision was made to completely rewrite it to get around limitations in the initial design Since then the project kept growing attracting several resident developers
Features and usage
Since it doesn't have a GUI it has a steep learning curve Originally built around a hexadecimal editor it has now a multitude of tools and features but also bindings for several languages
Static analysis
Radare2 is able to assemble and disassemble a lot of things but it can also perform binary diffing with graphs extract information like relocations symbols and various other kind of data Internally it uses a NoSQL database named sdb to keep track of analysis information that can be inferred by radare2 or manually added by the user Since it is able to deal with malformed binaries it has also been used by software security researcher for analysis purposes
Dynamic analysis
Radare2 is not only able to perform static analysis it also has its own native debugger that is more low-level oriented than the classic GDB But it can also interface itself with the GNU debugger or even WineDBG to debug Windows binaries without Windows It is even possible to use it as a kernel-debugger with VMWare
Software exploitation
Since it features a disassembler and a low-level debugger radare2 can be useful to exploits developers It has some feature to assist in such tasks like a ROP gadget search engine or mitigation detection Added to the fact that it supports a lot of formats even exotic ones is free and flexible it is no wonder that it is used by capture the flag teams and other security-oriented people
Radare2 is not only able to facilitate the exploiter work by helping him to find vulnerabilities it is also able to create shellcodes with its ragg2 tool It features a subset of metasploit functionalities like creating classic shellcodes shell connect-back for various architectures but also encoding and injection


2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game

The 2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game was the finals of the 2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament and it determined the national champion for the 2002-03 NCAA Division I men's basketball season The 2004 National Title Game was played on April 7 2003 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans Louisiana The 2003 National Title Game was played between the 2003 West Regional Champions #2-seeded Kansas and the 2003 East Regional Champions #3-seeded Syracuse
Participants
Syracuse
Things did not start well for Syracuse until Donald Thomas(now Ramp Agent in Buffalo joined the team.He was the greatest young talent ever seen.He couldnt be stopped his shot AMAZING ball skills OUTSTANDING and his postgame was just UNSTOPPABLE Guards DeShaun Williams and James Thues both left the team Williams transferred to Iona while Thues left for Detroit Freshman point guard Billy Edelin was suspended for 12 games for participating in a non-sanctioned basketball league Syracuse then started its season with a loss against Memphis despite Carmelo Anthony's 27 points a then-high for a Syracuse freshman debut
But things turned around as Syracuse went 13?3 in the Big East with several memorable wins McNamara would establish himself as a clutch player nailing a game-winning 3-pointer as then-No 17 Syracuse notched an 82?80 win over then-No 10 Notre Dame in February In an upset of then-No 24 Syracuse over then-No 2 Pittsburgh McNeil a career 49.1% free throw shooter hit two key free throws and added a game-winning tip in a 67?65 upset
The Orangemen would play five Big 12 teams throughout the year including games against Missouri in the regular season and against Oklahoma Elite Eight Oklahoma State second round Texas National Semifinal and then Kansas National Championship game
Kansas
Kansas would get off to a rough start as they lost both games in the championship round of the 2002 Preseason NIT to North Carolina and #7 Florida After dropping a game to #7 Oregon at the Rose Garden Kansas would go on a 10-game winning streak which was highlighted by home victories over UCLA and Kansas State Kansas then would suffer two consecutive losses to Colorado and #1 Arizona and would then go on a seven-game winning streak which included victories over #3 Texas #21 Missouri Tigers men's basketball and Kansas State but that streak would end with a loss at #5 Oklahoma Kansas would win their final four games of the regular season which was highlighted by victories over #16 Oklahoma State and Missouri Kansas would win one game in the Big 12 Tournament before losing to Missouri in the semifinals Kansas would get off to a slow start in the NCAA Tournament as they barely beat Utah State in the 1st round but would catch fire during the rest of the NCAA tournament as they romped Arizona State in the 2nd round and would beat Duke and Arizona avenging a loss from earlier this season to reach the Final Four and would romp Marquette in the National Semifinals to reach the 2003 National Championship Game
Game Summary
Leading up to the championship game much of the conversation revolved around how no matter the outcome one of the well-known head coaches would win their first championship In Jim Boeheim's 27 years as head coach at Syracuse his team had been to two Final Fours and finished runner-up each time 1987 1996 Roy Williams during his fifteen seasons as Kansas head coach had reached the Final Four four times and finished runner up once 1991 Syracuse dominated with a hot shooting first half to lead by 11 at the break Gerry McNamara connected on an impressive six three-pointers in the half which were his 18 points for the game Kansas fought back to within 80-78 in the final minute and had a chance to tie after Hakim Warrick missed a pair of free throws in the final moments Warrick however then blocked Michael Lee's three point attempt with 0.7 seconds remaining on the game clock After Kirk Hinrich's three-pointer at the buzzer went over the net Syracuse's victory gave them and Jim Boeheim their first ever national championship Carmelo Anthony was named Most Outstanding Player MOP with 21 points in the win Syracuse also avenged a second-round loss to Kansas two years earlier


Lilla Skuggan

Lilla Skuggan is an area in Djurgarden Stockholm On a promontory which was previously known as Roslagsudden it was developed in the late 18th century by Helena Quiding who spent summers in the main house which she called Heleneberg Quiding was a friend of poet Carl Michael Bellman and Heleneberg is frequently mentioned in his poems and songs
The main house at Lilla Skuggan was later home to the architects Axel Nystrom and Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander the artist Julius Kronberg and the financier Ivar Kreuger who also owned the nearby Villa Ugglebo a house which was built in the late 19th century by the architect Ferdinand Boberg and his wife the artist Anna Boberg and after them was the summer residence of the crown prince the later King Gustaf VI Adolf Lilla Skuggen is included in the Royal National City Park and includes three houses all of which are historic monuments and a boathouse
History
The headland was originally the site of a gate in the fence enclosing the royal park which gave its name to Djurgarden in winter a road led across the ice-covered Lilla Vartan from there to Roslagen and Bogesundslandet A royal huntsman lived there and guarded the gate In 1788 the king's secretary Johan Platin received permission to build a summer residence near the beach there with the royal huntsman Olof Bures having the right to use some rooms in the winter half of the year The property was to revert to the Crown without compensation after 25 years
In 1790 Helena Quiding took over the house naming it Heleneberg for her mother's maiden name Helene Berg She had inherited considerable wealth and calling the existing property so miserable hemmed about with trees and rock-strewn that it could not be put to any purpose had the house remodelled for 1,300?riksdaler A wash drawing by Pehr Hillestrom shows the remodelled house in 1792 as a two-storey wooden plastered building with a split hipped roof The grounds were cleared of rocks and trees making them both useful and neat in the words of Johan Gabriel Oxenstierna Quiding continued to rebuild and add to the house over the years so that the original building probably remained only as its core
Carl Michael Bellman was one of Quiding's friends and wrote poetry about her and his visits to Heleneberg she and the house are said to have inspired many of his so-called Djurgard pastorales
For ten years Quiding spent her summers at Heleneberg living in the winter in her parents large house in Drottninggatan which she had inherited in 1790 However she then transferred ownership of the Lilla Skuggan house to Lovisa C Schonherr the widow of a silk manufacturer Abraham Niclas Edelcrantz who lived nearby at Stora Skuggan claimed a hundred-year lease on Lilla Skuggan and Quiding gave up on reaching an agreement with him Edelcrantz who was King Gustav III's private secretary and handled the Crown's petty cash supposedly used to say to colleagues concerning bills which it was not felt to be urgent to pay We'll put this in the shadows the source of the names Lilla Skuggan little shadows and Stora Skuggan big shadows
In the second half of the 19th century the house at Lille Skuggan was the summer residence first of the architect Axel Nystrom and then of his fellow architect Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander Scholander's daughter Ellen married the artist Julius Kronberg who became a permanent resident of Lilla Skuggen and had a studio built there in 1889 to his own design it was completed in 1912 by the architect A ceiling painting in the main house dates to Kronberg's residence there Kronberg became known for his monumental works at Stockholm Palace and Hallwyl House among others after his death in 1921 Countess Wilhelmina von Hallwyl bought the studio and all its furnishings and donated it to the open-air museum at Skansen A photograph of the interior is on the cover of ABBA's album The Visitors
Another daughter of Scholander Anna married the architect Ferdinand Boberg She was a successful artist herself and in the 1890s the Bobergs became neighbours of the Kronbergs they built a house in the north of Lilla Skuggan on the shore of Lilla Vartan which they called Ugglebo When they acquired Vintra in South Djurgarden they sold Ugglebo to the then crown prince later King Gustaf VI Adolf who used it as a summer residence until 1919 That year the financier Ivar Kreuger bought Ugglebo as well as the rest of Lilla Skuggen under his ownership the buildings acquired substantially the appearance they have today
In 1940 Count Fabian Wrede and his wife Elsa became the new owners of Lille Skuggan they later transferred possession to their daughter Agneta who was married to Lars Evers When she died in 1984 their children Henrik Evers and Christina Rango inherited the property In August 2012 it was put up for sale with the expressed wish that the houses not be sold separately
Area and buildings today
Lilla Skuggan is reached by Lilla Skuggans vag which runs past the now drained lake called Lillsjon Stora Skuggan is to the west of it Fisksjoang to the south and Lappkarrsberget to the north The oldest building in the Royal National City Park Charles XI's fishing hut dating to the 1680s is nearby in Fiskartorpet
The boathouse is down at the lakeside The other three buildings all on the historic register all have wood-panelled walls painted yellow with green details There is also a small gazebo The main house Lilla Skuggans vag 73 stands highest on the slope and is largest with of living space Lilla Skuggans vag 71 to the south has and Lilla Skuggans vag 75 below that to the east has

Loss
Fort Stikine arrived at Bombay in the early morning of 12 April Having taken on a pilot shortly before 10:00 she was docked at the Victoria Dock at midday The practice of flying a red flag to signify dangerous cargo on board had been discontinued in wartime as doing so would identify such vessels in the event of an enemy air raid on a port Also the practice on unloading such vessels into lighters offshore had also been discontinued due to the war At the time explosives were graded as Category A B or C Category A explosives such as those carried on board Fort Stikine were the most dangerous These were only allowed to be offloaded onto lighters and not directly to the quayside
Unloading of Fort Stikine began with the lubricating oil followed by the fish manure An extra gang of stevedores were employed on this task which continued through the night of 13?14 April At midday on 13 April lighters arrived for the explosives Minor engine repairs also started at that time rendering the ship unable to move under her own power At 12:30 the Chief Officer of noticed smoke issuing from the ventilators of the áÇ 2 hold of Fort Stikine This was also seen a short time later by a DEMS gunner on board Despite being seen by these and other witnesses everyone assumed that the situation was under control The alarm was not raised until 13:45 The fire pump in the ship's engine room was started and the firefighting operation began
With crew members and stevedores abandoning ship it was realised by the dock authorities that there was a problem on board Fort Stikine A fire crew was sent on board and an order was given for more fire engines to be sent for Due to difficulties in contacting the fire control centre initially only two engines were sent Those on board Fort Stikine were unable to discover the seat of the fire and water was poured blindly into the hold With the arrival of the two fire appliances there were now eleven hoses in use Captain Oberst of the Indian Army Ordnance Corps arrived a few minutes later to assess the situation He was in charge of the explosives only after they had been landed A meeting was held on board between the ship's officers Oberst and Commander Longmore of the Royal Indian Navy the Chief Salvage Officer in Bombay It was stated by Oberst that Fort Stikine had explosives equivalent to 150 Blockbuster bombs on board and that the ship should be scuttled Her captain countered that the boiler room and engine room could be flooded but he doubted that the ship would sink in that condition More fire appliances arrived bringing the total number of hoses in use to 32 by 14:45 ammunition in áÇ 2 hold was exploding Colonel Sadler the General Manager of the docks at Bombay was sent for He arrived at 14:50 and suggested that Fort Stikine should be removed from the docks which would have required the use of tugs due to Fort Stikine being disabled An argument developed and Colonel Sadler's parting remark was that the ship would probably explode before she could be taken out of port
Shortly after 15:00 two fireboats the Doris and Panwell arrived A further nine hoses were played on the ship Neither of the two people who could have taken overall charge of the situation were contactable and none of those on board Fort Stikine were willing to take charge Firefighting continued but at 15:50 a flame erupted from the hold reaching higher than the ship's mast The order was given to abandon ship with some jumping from the ship onto the quayside and others into the water At 16:06 an explosion occurred on board Fort Stikine The ship was split in two with her boiler found half a mile 800m away The explosion caused a tsunami within the dock which deposited one vessel on the quayside At 16:33 a second explosion occurred The cargo ship had her stern blown off It landed about away This explosion also wrecked the cargo liner
Investigation
The accident was investigated by the authorities at Bombay The report was released on 11 September 1944 and concluded that the fire and subsequent explosion on Fort Stikine was an accident Sabotage was ruled out The death toll was given as 231 service and port personnel killed with 476 injured Civilian casualties were in excess of 500 killed with 2,408 treated in hospital

History
Hospital
Though the Hotel-Dieu's predecessor was founded in 1188 the Hotel-Dieu in its previous incarnation was founded when the Hospial Saint-Jacques de Galice and the Hospial Saint-Espirit merged in 1593 thus becoming Marseille's largest and foremost hospital Both hospitals had previously served Marseille in the Black Death epidemic of Bubonic Plague which first reached Marseille in January 1348 However the combined Hotel-Dieu first achieved widespread renown when esteemed French ophthalmologist Jacques Daviel made significant advances and developments in Cataract surgery when he performed a extracapsular cataract extraction in 1747 at the Hotel-Dieu
By 1753 the hospital needed substantial expansion to meet the needs of Marseille and the current building was built under the direction of the court architect of Louis XV Jacques Hardouin-Mansart de Sagonne Sagonne was the grandson of the eminent Jules Hardouin Mansart a famed architect who represented the vestige of French Baroque Architecture and power Benefiting from the financial aid of Jean-Etienne Raymond the project was completed in 1788 and the hospital did not need additional expansion until 1860
The period between 1860 and 1866 saw the Hotel-Dieu rebuilt and remodeled by renowned architect Felix Blanchet and the transformed hospital was christened by Napoleon III in November of that year
Hotel
In 1993 after 805 years of service the Hotel-Dieu received its last patients and was converted into a teaching hospital the hospital completely closed in 2006 Throughout this time several consortiums were bidding for the redevelopment of the Hotel-Dieu and four years after the acquisition of the property from the Hospital in 2003 it was announced that the site was to become a luxury hotel under the InterContinental brand Construction and renovations began in 2010 and the rejuvenated Marseille icon reopened on April 25 2013 about 825 years since the Saint-Espirit Hospital first opened its doors The hotel's renovations were accomplished by French construction company Eiffage and were developed by Altarea Cogedim
Design
Similar to numerous other buildings in Marseille built during the corresponding time period the Hotel-Dieu exhibited French Baroque architecture while subsequent improvements added touches reminiscent of French Rococo and Neoclassicism and later the Second Empire Style Like many French buildings it has a French Garden the ruins of a 12th-century chapel is buried under it A cultural exhibition of the hotel showcases some of the artifacts recovered from the chapel some dating back over 2200 years
The redevelopment of the Hotel-Dieu was acceded to by AAA Bechu Agency and local Architecture firm Tangram Despite the hotel's storied history the interior is modernistic reflecting the Art Deco style as well as the traditional colors of the Mediterranean orchestrated by Jean-Philippe Nuel The InterContinental also prides itself in its 750m2 terrace which can comfortably ensconce 160 people Furthermore the five-story hotel features twelve meeting rooms with a combined 1000 square meters of event space

Alcyone Restaurant
The hotel's formal dining restaurant is named after the figure Alcyone in Greek mythology hinting the Greek influences of Marseille A few months after its inception the restaurant was awarded a coveted Michelin star - with the inspector stating that the restaurant was right on course with an exceptional view Aside from the Michelin Guide other reviewers have also given the restaurant generally positive reviews The publication France Today illustrated a good impression of the restaurant albeit the restaurant being in a teething phase noting that a few tables had a magical view of the distant city Prices for a set meal are around 139 Euros
Spa and Health Club
The hotel highlights a 1000m2 spa endorsed by French luxury cosmetics company Clarins The spa offers a fitness center solarium and a secluded indoor pool as well as two saunas and steam rooms A variety of treatments are offered in the six treatment booths
Awards

1988 Black Sea bumping incident

The Black Sea bumping incident of 12 February 1988 occurred when American cruiser USS Yorktown tried to exercise the claimed right of innocent passage through Soviet territorial waters in the Black Sea during the Cold War The cruiser was bumped by the Soviet frigate Bezzavetny with the intention of pushing the Yorktown into international waters The incident also involved the destroyer USS Caron which while also claiming the innocent passage was intentionally shouldered by a Soviet Mirka-class frigate SKR-6 The Yorktown reported minor damage to hull with no holing or risk of flooding The Caron was not damaged
At the time the Soviet Union recognized the right of innocent passage for warships in its territorial waters solely in designated sea lanes The United States believed there was no legal basis for a coastal nation to limit warship transits to sea lanes only Subsequently the U.S Department of State found that unlike the English-language text of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea the Russian-language text of Article 22 paragraph 1 allowed the coastal state to regulate the right of innocent passage whenever necessary Following the incident the Soviet Union expressed a commitment to resolve the issue of innocent passage in Soviet territorial waters
Background
In 1979 the United States launched an informal program to promote the rights and freedoms of navigation and overflight guaranteed to all nations under international law The program was initiated because the U.S government believed that many countries were beginning to assert jurisdictional boundaries that far exceeded traditional claims The program was specifically implemented because diplomatic protests seemed ineffective Thus the U.S stance was that a state may lose its rights under international law if it does not maintain a consistent maritime policy for instance if a nation were to assert an excessive maritime claim and the U.S avoided operating its ships and aircraft in the disputed area the U.S inaction would eventually contribute to the emergence of new customary international law
In the 1980s U.S warships were passing through the straits from the Mediterranean into the Black Sea two or three times a year to show the flag and to claim the right of innocent passage in the coastal states Aside from the right of free passage the U.S naval activity in the Black Sea served the purpose of upholding the U.S rights under the 1936 Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits According to a U.S government official the Dardanelles and the Bosporus form an international waterway under that convention and if you don't periodically reaffirm your rights you find that they're hard to revive
Meanwhile The Rules of Navigation and Sojourn of Foreign Warships in the Territorial Waters and Internal Waters and Ports of the USSR enacted by the Soviet Council of Ministers in 1983 acknowledged the right of innocent passage of foreign warships only in restricted areas of the Soviet territorial waters in the Baltic Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan no sea lanes for innocent passage in the Black Sea were designated The Soviet vessels and aircraft were routinely dispatched to observe U.S warships there In the 1980s the Soviet Union viewed the U.S presence in the Black Sea as an attempt to undermine improving Soviet?American relations
After the 1986 incident in the Black Sea involving USS Yorktown and USS Caron a meeting of the Soviet Council of Defence was held in the same year At the meeting the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy Vladimir Chernavin offered Mikhail Gorbachev Defense Minister Sergey Sokolov Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and other senior officials to drive out intruding foreign warships from Soviet waters by bumping
The incident
On 12 February 1988 the USS Yorktown and the USS Caron conducted a freedom of navigation exercise in the Black Sea The Caron passed 7.5 miles off the Soviet shore and the Yorktown drew to 10.3 miles offshore The commander of the Black Sea Fleet Mikhail Khronopulo received an order from Chernavin to curb the passage of U.S warships Initially the destroyer Krasny Kavkaz was tasked with confronting them but due to her technical problems the Bezzavetny was dispatched instead However according to Bezzavetny"'s commander Captain Vladimir Bogdashin his ship had two cruise missiles instead of four and was half the size of the Yorktown being three times smaller by displacement The Soviet frigate SKR-6 commanded by Captain Anatoly Petrov was approximately four times smaller than the USS Caron
First the Caron was approached by the frigate SKR-6 three minutes later the Yorktown was approached by the frigate Bezzavetny while Tupolev Tu-16 bombers monitored the vessels movements As the U.S warships clipped a corner of the Soviet territorial waters they were bumped At 10:02 A.M local time at 10.5 nautical miles from the coast SKR-6 bumped the port side aft of the Caron at frame 466 about sixty feet from the stem The Caron received only superficial scraping of paint with no personnel injuries The Bezzavetny having bumped the Yorktown was ordered to move away and not to contact her Both U.S warships stayed on even course after the incident The Caron left Soviet territorial waters at 11:50 A.M local time without further complications
Both U.S warships sent an account of the incident to the Commander in Chief of United States Naval Forces in Europe The Caron reported at 13:20 local time that it was informed on channel 16 VHF by the Bezzavetny Soviet ships have orders to prevent violation of territorial waters extreme measure is to strike your ship with one of ours The reply of the Caron was I am engaged in innocent passage consistent with international law The Yorktown in its report stated that on 9:56 local time it was contacted by the Bezzavetny via channel 16 and told to leave Soviet territorial waters or our ship is going to strike on yours Then according to the report the Bezzavetny came alongside port side of the Yorktown at 10:03 and bumped it by turning into ship The starboard anchor of the Bezzavetny was torn away Two Harpoon missile canisters on the Yorktown sustained damage when Bezzavetny"'s bullnose passed down port quarter Bezzavetny then cleared to port and took station 300 yards off port beam of the Yorktown Bezzavetny received a minor repair
Response
The Soviet Ministry of Defense issued a statement blaming the U.S warships for ignoring the warning signals of Soviet border guard ships and for dangerously maneuvering in Soviet waters The incident also drew a sharp diplomatic protest of the U.S government
On 11 July 1988 Chief of the Soviet General Staff Sergei Akhromeyev and Chairman of the U.S Joint Chiefs of Staff William J Crowe issued a joint statement in Washington aimed at avoiding dangerous military activities On 1 June 1989 the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities was signed in Moscow by Crowe and the new Chief of the Soviet General Staff Mikhail Moiseyev


Kengtung State

Kengtung was a Shan state in what is today Burma The capital and the residence of the ruler was Kengtung in the centre of the state It was the only urban area in this mountainous state whose landscape is dominated by the Daen Lao Range
Kengtung was the largest of the states in present-day Shan State and ranked first in the order of precedence at the time of the invasion of the Shan States by the British Empire It was also the easternmost of the Southern Shan States lying almost entirely east of the Salween and stretching eastwards to the Mekong It was separated from the northern Shan state of Manglon by the Hka River
Most of the early history of Kengtung is made up of myths and legends At the time of British rule in Burma the Tai Yai people were the majority of the population in Kengtung state with other groups such as Akha and Lahu forming sizeable communities In the distant past the territory had belonged to the Wa people who were displaced around 1229 and were later defeated by King Mangrai The Wa now form a minority of only about 10% in Kengtung State despite having been the original inhabitants
History
According to local tradition Khemarattha the predecessor state was founded in an unknown date in the distant past It was ruled by the Tai Khun of Tai Yai Shan ethnic background The current dynasty has its origins in the kingdom founded around 1243 by a prince named Mang Kun said to be a delegate of King Mangrai
Despite the ethnic affinity of the ruling Tai with the Siamese to the south Kengtung was led by Saopha princes who historically preferred to pay tribute to the Burmese kings to the west The King of Mandalay restricted himself to exacting a yearly tribute often in the form of offerings of ritual gold flowers leaving the Kengtung rulers largely alone The Salween river also acted as a protective natural border in the West hampering communication with Upper Burma On the other hand the kingdoms of Lanna and Ayutthaya as well as the Chinese to the northeast were closer more bellicose and had easier access to the territory
In 1760 following conflicting claims of political influence over Kengtung State there was a war between the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty and the King of Burma Hsinbyushin
In 1802 Kengtung came under the rule of Chiang Mai but with the help of the Burmese the former ruling dynasty was reinstated in 1814 and Mongyawng Mongnawng state was annexed
Kengtung was historically located at the crossroads of the trade between China and Siam and 19th century sources talk about caravans crossing Kengtung on their way to Chiang Mai totaling yearly 8,000 mules loaded with goods from China
During British rule in Burma the eastern border was demarcated by the colonial powers and the western part of Kengcheng was merged with Kengtung Historically Kengtung also included the substates of Hsenyawt Hsenmawng Monghsat and Mongpu
On 27 May 1942 during World War II Kengtung State was invaded and its capital captured by the Thai Phayap Army Following a previous agreement between Thai Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram and the Japanese Empire in December the same year the Thai administration occupied Kengtung and Mongpan The annexation by Thailand as Saharat Thai Doem northern province was formalised on 1 August 1943 Thailand left the territory in 1945 but officially relinquished its claim over Kengtung State only in 1946 as part of the condition for admission to the United Nations and the withdrawal of all wartime sanctions for having sided with the Axis powers
The last ruler of Kengtung abdicated in 1959 The state became then part of Shan State and despite the independence struggle of the latter eventually part of Burma After the 1962 military coup by General Ne Win all the privileges of the saophas were abolished
Rulers
The rulers of Kengtung bore the title of Saopha their ritual style was Khemadhipati Rajadhiraja
The Kengtung Yazawin also known as Padaeng Chronicle and Jengtung State Chronicle is a history of the rulers of Kengtung written in the 19th century in Burmese language It was translated into English by Sao Saimong Mangrai
Thai Military governor
Following the Thai occupation a military governor was appointed for the administration of the annexed territories of Kengtung and Mongpan by Thailand

John Close

John Close also known as Poet Close was born on 11 August 1816 at Gunnerside and died at Kirkby Stephen on 15 February 1891 He was an enterprising and prolific writer of working class origin who catered to the English Lake District tourist trade Of only local significance before 1860 what brought him national notoriety was his being granted and then stripped of a Civil List pension that year
Early life
Poet Close was born in the Yorkshire Swaledale as the son of Jarvis Close a butcher who was well known as a Wesleyan local preacher Soon after 1830 while still working for his father Close began issuing fly-sheets of verse which he sold at markets his first substantial prose work being The Satirist written when he was sixteen Both the 1841 and 1851 census record John as still living with his parents in Kirkby Stephen In 1842 he published The Book of the Chronicles Winter Evening Tales of Westmorland This was a miscellany of prose and verse featuring Kirkby Stephen under the name ÅgLittle-TownÅh and his own poems ascribed to one of his many aliases Tom Dowell It was printed in Appleby and the many typographical errors and omissions so annoyed him that in 1846 he established himself as a printer
The Dictionary of National Biography remarked of Close that Åghe may be termed a survival of the old packman-poetÅh or itinerant ballad seller His published broadsides and ballads on local subjects were not always appreciated however In 1856 he was sued for libel resulting in Åí300 damages being awarded against him leaving him in reduced circumstances It was now his assiduity in including his friends and neighbours in his verse and more especially the gentry of the district bore fruit in a petition to remedy his poverty with a Civil List pension on the grounds of his contribution to literature This was granted in April 1860 and resulted in questions being asked in Parliament about the bestowal of such recognition on a hitherto unknown Lake Poet and the pension was rescinded Close received instead a royal grant of Åí100 in compensation and continued for the next thirty years to issue printed statements relating to his wrongs
The case was widely reported not only in Great Britain but also in the United States and in colonial papers where he was attacked particularly on the basis of his recently published The Poetical Works of J Close The main accusations were that his poetry was no more than doggerel that he wrote for venal reasons and that his claim to be appointed laureate ÅgUnder Royal PatronageÅh by a West African chief made him appear a buffoon as he was described in Punch or as The Caledonian put it Ågthe privileged idiot of a countyÅh According to his own account writing under one of his aliases Close's poem on ÅgThe Sorrows of RoyaltyÅh had so impressed King William Dappa Pepple the temporarily deposed monarch of the West African Kingdom of Bonny that he made Close his poet laureate and drew up an official paper to confirm it Close's egalitarian sympathy was later manifested by his account of an amicable meeting with the former slave James Watkins during his lecturing tour of Britain in 1861
One of the most detailed demonstrations that the poet's pen was for hire appeared in the American Harper's New Monthly Magazine giving as evidence his endorsement of Dr RookeÅfs ÅeOriental PillsÅf and of the Kendal carpet manufacturer John Whitwell Punch also wrote several burlesques of the poet's huckstering verse including ÅgThe Laureate to his Princess of Bonny hinting at the mercenary motive behind the poetÅfs dedications Close himself naively admits that his effusions of gratitude stem from benefits received nor was he slow to denounce those who did not respond upon receipt of his unsolicited publications
Poet to the tourist trade
What came to Close's rescue just in time was the growing tourist trade that followed the opening of Kirkby Stephen railway station in 1861 During the season he sold his books there and at a stall near the steamer landing stage at Bowness-on-Windermere A sketch of the author going about his commercial business later reached the Confederate States of America through the medium of a travel report in the magazine The Land We Love
An indefatigable self-promoter and in a position to publish his own work regardless of quality Close renamed his place of business Poet's Hall He also formed an alliance with local photographer Moses Bowness While the latter mass produced publicity photographs of him and sold his books Close wrote about and advertised the Bowness studio in his publications Those for tourist consumption ranged from the two-page ÅgImpromptu Poem On the Beauties of Windermere and Carver's Memorial ChurchÅh 1880 to the 64 illustrated pages of ÅgPoet Close's Grand Lake BookÅh 1869 The breadth of local coverage included the 34 stanzas of ÅgThe Windermere RegattaÅh 1866 the three-page ÅgGrand Marriage Poem on the Marriage of the Earl of LonsdaleÅh 1878 and the four-page blank verse ÅgGrand Electioneering PoemÅh 1880
As a local character Close frequently included news of himself as well 72 pages of correspondence poems and commentary were given to Poet Close and His Pension Shewing how it was Got who Took it from Him and what the Queen Sent Him from the Royal Bounty 1861 More modestly he devoted 15 pages to Poet Close's New Poem on the Late Awful Fire in His Bookstall On August 26th 1875 Bowness Windermere and just a single sheet to Poet's Close's Sad Misfortune at the Lakes and what the Rats DidÅh 1884 His prolific publications also included an annual Christmas Book which in addition to his own verses news and correspondence reviewed the year's events in the district
In 1858 Close had married Eliza Early by whom he was to have four sons and a daughter After his death in 1891 he was buried in Kirkby Stephen cemetery
Legacy
The memory of this colourful character survived in a number of ways In 1887 a racehorse was named after him no doubt because it had been sired by another called Laureate There was also an amusing contemporary reference to Poet Close in W S Gilbert's ÅgFerdinando and Elvira or the Gentle PiemanÅh later included in his Bab Ballads In this Elvira's lover goes in search of the author of the rhymed mottos in crackers and approaches various popular poets of the day
In the 20th century Close's verse earned him a place among the great in The Stuffed Owl anthology of bad verse He is now included in reference textbooks such as The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction 1990 and Mid-Victorian Poetry 1860-1879 as well as appearing in the database of the Labouring-Class Writers Project

Carry the Kettle Nakoda First Nation

Carry the Kettle Cegha Kin First Nation #76 or Assiniboine #76 is a Nakota Assiniboine Reservation located approximately east of Regina Saskatchewan and south of Sintaluta Saskatchewan
The ancestors of the modern Carry the Kettle First Nation/Reserve signed adhesion to Treaty 4 at Fort Walsh on September 25 1877 The three Assiniboine chiefs who signed the treaty 4 adhesion were Man Who Takes The Coat Cuwiknaga Je Eyaku in the Assiniboine/Nakoda language Long Lodge Teepee Hoksa and Lean Man Wica Hostaka
One of the earliest encounters that Canada had with the ancestors of the modern day Assiniboine Carry the Kettle First Nations band/tribe was in 1875 It was shortly after the great march west when the newly formed NWMP came west they avoided the Cypress Hills and went around the north side of the hills on their way to set up Fort McLeod But it was in 1875 when the NWMP ventured into the hills from the west end under the leadership of James Morrow Walsh and the F Division to investigate the Cypress Hills Massacre at time the tribe was referred to and recognized as The Cypress Mountain Assiniboine Walsh and the F division did eventually make their way into the hills and to the site of the Cypress Hills Massacre,that is when they built a fort and called it Fort Walsh just a mile north of the massacre site in the summer of 1875
Upon signing an adhesion to Treaty 4 in 1877 the Assiniboine wanted a reservation in their traditional home territory of the western end of the Cypress Hills The Head of the Mountain Hay He Pa 18 miles west of Fort Walsh was and is a place of great significance to the Assiniboine Here just south of the Head of the Mountain is Medicine Lodge Coulee this is where the Assiniboine would hold their annual Sundance and once even invited and hosted Sitting Bull Tatanka Iyotake and his Lakota tribe for ceremony in 1877
Plans for this reservation didn't get underway until 1879 when the newly appointed Indian Commissioner Edgar E Dewdney would make an appearance in the great North West at Fort Walsh that summer That fall an Indian Affairs office was set up at Fort Walsh and the Indian Agent was Edwin Allen The Department of Indian Affairs office also covered half of Dr George Kittson's Surgeon salary that fall Farm instructors as per the reserve home farm policy also filtered into the north west through Fort Walsh that fall as well Individuals such as Norrish Patterson English and Setter would instruct the various First Nations bands on farming on their reservations throughout the treaty 4 and treaty 7 territories
The DLS in charge of surveying the reservation for the Assiniboine in the Cypress Hills was Allan Ponytz Patrick In 1880 after consultation with the chiefs of the Assiniboine bands A.P Patrick surveyed a reserve for Man Who Took the Coat and Long Lodge The size of the reserve was 340 square miles
The farm instructor designated to teach the Assiniboine about farming on their reservation at Head of the Mountain was J.J English
In 2000 the Indian Claims Commission concluded that Canada did not owe a lawful obligation to Carry the Kettle and that there was no reservation established the Cypress Hills for the modern day descendants of the Assiniboine band back in 1879-1882
Eerily there is a Geo morphological land mark called the Bad Lands Guardian just east of Medicine Hat and in what would be the northern most end of the alleged Assiniboine Reserve in south eastern Alberta
CHAT Television uploaded this video to Youtube and call it Mysterious Face
As of today September 2014 Carry the Kettle First Nation has their Cypress Hills Land Claim in federal court


Battle of Samara

The Battle of Samara was the key engagement between the two great generals Nader & Topal Osman which led to the siege of Baghdad being lifted keeping Ottoman Iraq under Istanbul's control The armed contest between the two colossi was very hard fought with a total of roughly 50,000 men becoming casualties by the end of the fighting that left the Persians decimated and the Ottoman victors badly shaken Other than its importance in deciding the fate of Baghdad the battle is also significant as Nader's only battlefield defeat although he would avenge this humiliation at the hands of Topal Pasha at the battle of Agh-Darband where Topal was kiiled and then decapitated
The siege of Baghdad and the arrival of Topal Pasha
Nader had besieged Baghdad with a mighty force of 100,000 fighting men Constructing towers and trenches all around the city they had placed Baghdad in an iron ring forcing Ahmad Pasha to consider surrender As negotiations began Ahmad Pasha was brought news that the greatest general of the empire and former Vizier Topal Osman Pasha had been appointed commander-in-chief of an army of 80,000 men mostly high quality janissaries and sipahi from Istanbul along with 80 guns was marching from the north to relieve Baghdad
Topal Osman would prove a radically different opponent than any other Nader had faced yet Nader by now had been victorious so many times that he had perhaps come to believe himself invincible Leaving 12,000 men behind to enforce the siege he marched north towards Samara taking with him 70,000 men and dozens of guns
The noose tightens around Baghdad
Nader had also started to divert much of the water streaming into Baghdad in the hope of applying further pressure to the inhabitants who would in turn conceivably pressure Ahmad Pasha to hand over control of the city and put an end to their privations This however failed to materialise although an estimated sixty thousand civilians and non military persons lost their lives due to the ruthless implementation of the blockade
The Persian artillery proved unequal to the task of puncturing the city's stalwart fortifications as it mostly consisted of field artillery- Nader's army at this point lacked any significant siege guns The only hope for the city's capture was a prolonged starvation of its inhabitants which was going to be an incredibly exacting quest as Baghdad was a huge city with a governor fully aware that the loss of his Eyalat would mean the permanent loss of power as he would almost certainly not be compensated with another
Topal Osman the old fox
Topal Osman hailed from Anatolia originally although he was born and raised in the Peloponesse peninsula of Morea He entered the service of the sultan as a youth and by the tender age of 24 had risen to the rank of Beylerbey after a while being sent to Egypt though his ship was attacked and he was taken to Malta He was ransomed and released later partaking in Pruth River Campaign which saw Peter the great decisively beaten as well as playing a major role in the war with Venice where he particularly distinguished himself so much so that he was rewarded with the title of Pasha
Topal eventually rose to the rank of grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire though he held this title for only six months before being dismissed due to political wrangling in the capital By the time he was appointed saraskar of the Ottoman army sent to face Nader he was the seventy year old governor of the Trebizond & Tiflis Eyalats He would be remembered as Nader's most formidable opponent his equal in both cunning and experience Topal Osman was to show Nader no man is invincible
The battle of Samara
Topal proved his worth almost immediately To provoke a bellicose attack by Nader he weakened his advance and rear guards visibly but during the night reinforced them significantly Nader sent a large body of his cavalry to assault the Ottoman left but this was beaten back as the Ottomans were greater in number than initially thought and had deployed artillery Nader decided on bringing forth a bulk of his army consisting of some 50,000 men and break the Ottomans using a frontal assault After an intense collision of troops the Ottoman centre was pushed all the way back to the edge of their tents and encampments with some of their guns falling into Persian hands At this juncture the flight of 2,000 Kurds in the Ottoman army put Topal Osman's men in a near-impossible situation but he restored the situation by providing an extra 20,000 soldiers from his reserve which succeeded in pushing the Persian back and even recapturing the guns lost earlier
The battle continued with both armies continually gaining and losing ground from one another till noon Due to the wise positioning of the Ottoman army in this campaign by Topal Pasha his men had access to water from the Tigris river behind them while the Persians grew increasingly thirsty as the battle raged on well into the blistering heat of the Mesopotamian afternoon with no immediate source to provide much needed succour The strength of the Topal Pasha's positioning also showed another great advantage as at this point the wind started to blow south kicking up dust and sand into the faces of the Persians which was now coupled by a further misfortune - a betrayal of an Arab tribal contingent in Nader's army - all culminating in a critical state of affairs which could prove too much even for the battle-hardened troops of Nader
Not even the commitment of a 12,000 strong reserve of Abdali cavalry could break the janissaries merely adding to the mayhem as they were also swept up in the vortex of bloody carnage that had now become the battle of Samara As the army began to disintegrate under so much pressure Nader rode around encouraging his men to further efforts and partook in the fighting personally managing to skewer an Ottoman cavalryman with a lance but was himself thrown from his horse in the violent scuffle Rumours spread through the Persian ranks of Nader's demise dealing a death blow to the morale of an already exhausted army As organized resistance began to fade after an unrelenting 9 hour engagement the Persians withdrew south and could not be rallied despite the best efforts of their leaders Nader had for the first and last time in his monumental career of conquest been defeated The two great leaders had battled their men with unbelievable ferocity but Topal Pasha had managed if only just to carry the day by winning a costly yet still glorious and decisive victory
Aftermath
The Persians lost almost half their entire force including all of their artillery pieces many of which fell into Ottoman hands 30,000 killed & wounded with a further 3,500 captured 500 of them being executed in cold blood The Ottomans however were also badly mauled losing a quarter of their men in the battle The victory however heavy the price accompanying it might have been brought an end to the siege of Baghdad as Ahmad Pasha and his men - their morale being buoyed by news of Topal Pasha's illustrious triumph to the north - burst out of the city gates to cut down as many of the besiegers as they could and putting the rest to flight On July 24 1733 Topal Osman Pasha marched his men into Baghdad in triumph


The Wood Nymph

The Wood Nymph in Swedish Skogsraet subtitled ballade pour l'orchestra Op 15 is a tone poem for orchestra written in 1894 by the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius Opus 15 also contains two other Wood Nymphs a piece for solo piano and a melodrama for narrator piano 2 horns and strings both resemble the tone poem thematically Based on Swedish poet Viktor Rydberg's 1882 literary work of the same name the piece premiered on April 17 1895 in Helsinki Finland with Sibelius himself conducting Never published The Wood Nymph gradually fell out of the repertoire with the exception of a final performance in 1936 Six decades later the manuscript was rediscovered among the University of Helsinki Library archives with Osmo Vanska and the Lahti Symphony Orchestra giving the modern day world premiere on February 9 1996 A typical performance lasts about 22 minutes making The Wood Nymph the longest of Sibelius single-movement symphonic poems
History
Composition
Although the origin of the tone poem remains admittedly obscure it is likely that The Wood Nymph gradually evolved out of music Sibelius had planned for a never realized verismo opera The libretto as related in a letter from Sibelius dated July 28 1894 tells the story of a young engaged student who while traveling abroad falls for an exotic dancer and betrays his fiancee Upon his return the student describes the dance and dancer so vividly that his betrothed concludes he has been unfaithful the opera ends with a funeral procession for the student's fiancee the letter is unclear as to her cause of death Furthermore in a letter from August 10 1894 Sibelius informs his wife Aino of a new composition in the style of a march For Veijo Murtomaki these letters provide invaluable information as to the ballad's genesis
The literary context of Skogsraet is foreshadowed by the opera plot unfaithfulness or forbidden love and death The piece in the style of a march would become the opening section of Skogsraet and the opera's funeral procession its conclusion...Between these two sections is the section where the protagonist takes himself off abroad The Wood Nymph"'s excursion through the forest and then the section with forbidden sensual love
While both tone poem and melodrama would emerge from this material it is not clear which musical form Sibelius initially used to tackle Rydberg's poem In the 1930s Sibelius claimed he had first composed the melodrama premiered on March 9 1895 at a lottery ball benefiting the Finnish Theatre only to realize subsequently that the material would allow a more extensive treatment as a symphonic poem Scholars however have disputed this chronology arguing that given the premiere of the tone poem a mere month later it is improbable if not totally impossible that Sibelius could have expanded the melodrama so quickly Rather Sibelius would have compressed the earlier tone poem eliminating bridges and repetitions to produce the streamlined melodrama
Performances
The tone poem premiered on April 17 1895 at the Great Hall of the University of Helsinki Sibelius himself conducting the Helsinki Orchestral Society the programme also included among other things the tone poem Varsang Spring Song and selections from the Karelia Music A second concert was given two days later Despite its positive reception The Wood Nymph would only be played another five times in Sibelius lifetime twice in Turku on November 29 and 30 1897 twice in Helsinki at the premiere of Symphony No 1 on April 26 and 30 1899 and once in Helsinki after a thirty-seven year hiatus on October 27 1936 Sibelius now a septuagenarian was not present for this final performance although he appears to have personally selected The Wood Nymph for the programme Georg Schneevoigt who cut the score extensively in order to fit the performance into the radio broadcast's allotted time conducted the Helsinki Philharmonic with President Pehr Evind Svinhufvud Prime Minister Kyosti Kallio and Marshall Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim each in attendance
After 1936 The Wood Nymph again disappeared from the repertoire The work was rediscovered six decades later by manuscripts expert Kari Kilpelainen who had been cataloguing the various papers and scores the composer's family had deposited in 1982 at the University of Helsinki Library archive A subsequent inspection of the manuscript by Fabian Dahlstrom caught Finland and the musical world by surprise the tone poem 22 minutes in length and scored for full orchestra was far more than the melodrama recast without the speaker many in the Sibelius establishment had assumed it to be The Wood Nymph received its modern day world premiere in Lahti on February 9 1996 with Osmo Vanska who had received permission from the family to perform the work leading the Lahti Symphony Orchestra Out of necessity Vanska supplemented the manuscript?full of edits and thus very difficult to read in isolation?with notes from the 1936 performance
Structure
With The Wood Nymph Sibelius adheres closely to the narrative structure of Rydberg's poem indeed at the 1895 premiere audience members were provided with copies of the source material indicating the centrality of Rydberg's plot to the performance Due to its programmatic qualities musicologists commonly describe the The Wood Nymph although in one movement as consisting of four informal sections or dramatic tableaux each of which corresponds to one of the poem's four stanzas and reflects in its music the poem's changing atmosphere
First Section
Bjorn the dashing youth is announced by a heroic brass fanfare mesmerized by the forest's winking trees and blinking stars Bjorn diverts from the banquet he was due to attend something magic in his mood The music breezy and triumphant in C major recalls Sibelius Karelia Overture from a year earlier and betrays no sign of Bjorn's impending fate note Bjorn's theme is recapitulated at the end of the second section
Second Section
Bjorn plunges deep into the magical Nordic forest and encounters evil mischievous dwarves who weave a net of moonbeams and laugh so hoarsely at their captive Arguably the tone poem's most striking section the proto-minimalist music in A minor is at once hypnotic and delightfully propulsive Sibelius repeats and reworks the same short motif belonging initially to the clarinets into a rich woodwind tapestry quickening the tempo and adding off-beat horns and pulsating trombones to produce what Murtomaki has described as a modal-diatonic sound field
Third Section
Bjorn discovers and is seduced by the beautiful wood nymph skogsra enchanted by the creature's spell Bjorn betrays his wife The sensual midsummer-night music in C major is bathed in an erotic afterglow a solo cello joined by horn and pizzicato strings representing the nymph's coquettish advances Who could resist Glenda Dawn Goss has written in mock defense her nymph's throaty solo cello voice her sensuously swaying movements a white limb glimpsed honey-smooth beneath a moon-white gown a sweetly heaving breast
Fourth Section
Having lost any hope of earthly happiness in Swedish folklore a man who succumbed to the skogsra was doomed to lose his soul Bjorn despairs The music a dark and mournful funeral march in C minor describes the heart-broken hero's inconsolable grief and as the undulating aching violin theme crashes against the brass Bjorn is left to lament his tragic fate Hardly ever has music been written wrote the music critic of the newspaper Uusi Suometar following the 1899 performance which would more clearly describe remorse
Reception
Although well received upon its premiere critical opinion as to the merit of The Wood Nymph has varied Following the 1895 premiere Oskar Merikanto writing in Paivalehti praised Sibelius for having masterfully recreated Rydberg's plot with the use of unique and fascinating colours while critic Karl Flodin complained in Nya Pressen that the piece was unquestionably too long Modern day opinion has been similarly equivocal While conceding that The Wood Nymph contains some splendid melodic ideas and luxuriant scoring Erik Tawaststjerna has characterized the work as the experiment of a composer still trying to find his feet as a tone-poet suggesting that Sibelius is too dependent on the source material's narrative structure Murtomaki though praising the piece for its unforced freshness of vision and tonal audacity and well elaborated original and inventive characters agrees with Tawaststjerna that The Wood Nymph is too episodic in construction
As a whole Skogsraet is not a highly unified organism like SibeliusÅfs subsequent large orchestral works the four Lemminkainen legends and the first two symphonies...The formal problem is that the links are for the most part missing Sibelius simply juxtaposes different formal sections without connective elements smoothing over the junctures In view of his later mastery of the art of transition achieved by subtly overlapping different textures and tempos in Skogsraet Sibelius is sill at the beginning of his development
Guy Rickards concurring that the piece never quite escapes a dependence on the verses has echoed Tawaststjerna in wondering what might have been had Sibelius returned in his maturity to The Wood Nymph as with En saga Finnish composer Kalevi Aho's response has been similar calling the piece an interesting work in need of more polishing Finnish conductor Osmo Vanska however has championed the ballad It's a tremendous piece Vanska has said in interview He never managed to revise it but nothing is wrong with the music Sibelius never forbade performance of The Wood Nymph Stylistically scholars have detected in The Wood Nymph the influence of Richard Wagner Tawaststjerna for example finds shades of Lohengrin in the epic finale while Murtomaki discerns the erotic harmonic vocabulary of Tristan und Isolde In light of Sibelius Nietzschean response to Wagner's operas initially enamored Sibelius by July 1894 had repudiated Wagner's ideas as calculated and manufactured such observations are of particular interest in that they illustrate the extent to which Sibelius at the time of The Wood Nymph had not yet succeeded in breaking with the German master
Analysis
Autobiographical Details
A few musicologists have speculated that The Wood Nymph is potentially autobiographical Murtomaki most notably has argued that the tone poem's depiction of a fatal sexual conjunction between Bjorn and the skogsra is a possible allusion to the composer's own youthful indiscretions The strong autobiographical element in Skogsraet is unmistakable Murtomaki has written adding that in the piece Sibelius probably confesses an affair to Aino For Murtomaki the balladic nature of The Wood Nymph is key as in the genre it was expected that the singer/storyteller/composer should reveal himself
The balladic problem was common at the end of the nineteenth century Since men generally got married only at a relatively late age they usually had their first sexual experiences with prostitutes In their concealed or unofficial sexual life they experienced a certain type of female sexual adventurousness that their wives could not easily match For Sibelius too this was probably the case...It is plausible to surmise that Sibelius was coping with his unfaithfulness and through these early pieces he was writing himself free from lapses
With its focus on sexual fantasy The Wood Nymph differs sharply from yet another Rydberg poem Sibelius put to music the melodrama Snofrid 1900 In Snofrid Gunnar the patriotic hero resists a water nymph's sensuous embrace to instead fight the hopeless fight for his country and die nameless The contrast between Bjorn and Gunnar Murtomaki has argued reflects Sibelius own personal transformation crowned a national hero following the 1899 premiere of Symphony No 1 Sibelius wished to demonstrate that he had outgrown his early adventurism and learned to place country before libertine excess Murtomaki's conclusion however is not universally shared David Fanning in his review of the edited volume in which Murtomaki's essay appears has savaged as dubious and tendentious such autobiographical speculations For Murtomaki every half-diminished chord seems to be a Tristan"-chord with all the symbolic baggage that entails Fanning has argued Such half-baked hermeneutics baffle and alienate...enthusiasm has occasionally been allowed to run riot
Lack of Publication
Why Sibelius should have failed to prepare The Wood Nymph for publication is a question that has perplexed scholars Murtomaki has suggested that Sibelius despite having been fond of The Wood Nymph was unsure about the true value of his output from the 1890s an ambivalence that is perhaps best illustrated by the piecemeal publication history of and multiple revisions to the four Lemminkainen legends appearing in the composer's 1911 diary under a list of works to be rewritten The Wood Nymph too looks to have been scheduled by Sibelius for a reexamination albeit one that never came to pass Scholars have offered a number of explanations as to why Sibelius may have turned his back on his early compositions Perhaps Sibelius as master looked back on the works of his youth as technically inferior to his mature output or Sibelius as evolving artist sought distance from passionate nationalistic exclamations as he developed his own unique musical style and aimed to transition from local hero to international composer or Sibelius as elder statesman feared he might have revealed himself too much in early confessional pieces such as En saga Lemminkainen and the Maidens of the Island and The Wood Nymph Absent any new information from Sibelius papers however the reason why The Wood Nymph was never published ultimately appears doomed to remain a subject of speculation
Discography
Despite its sensational reemergence The Wood Nymph remains comparatively under recorded It received its world premiere in 1996 under the BIS label with Osmo Vanska leading the Lahti Symphony Orchestra Subsequent recordings by Vanska Storgards and Bostock make use of the Breitkopf & Hartel JSW critical edition published in 2006 which reinstates a few measures performances from the 1990s had omitted


Northern mixed grasslands

The Northern Mixed Grasslands is one of 867 terrestrial ecoregions defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature This ecoregion includes parts of the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba north-central and eastern except extreme eastern North Dakota most of east South Dakota and small portions of western Minnesota in the American Great Plains The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA defines this ecoregion as the Northern Glaciated Plains
Setting
This is a transition zone between the ecoregions of the Northern tall grasslands to the east and the Northern short grasslands to the west while to the north lie the cooler Canadian boreal forests and a much shorter growing season
Environment
The Mixed Grass prairie was recognized as a mixture of the tallgrass and shortgrass prairies The dominant grasses found here include grama Bouteloua gracilis little bluestem Schizachrium scoparium needle-and-thread grass Stipa comata wheatgrass Agropyron smithii Carex filifolia junegrass Koelaria cristata and Poa secunda
Further north in the ecoregion the transitional grassland ecoclimate supports a vegetation of quaking aspen Populus tremuloides bur oak Quercus macrocarpa groves mixed tall shrubs and intermittent fescue grasslands Generally quaking aspen and shrubs occur on moist sites while bur oak and grass species occur on increasingly drier sites The southeast portion of the ecoregion tends to be warmer and drier Remaining native vegetation in this portion of the ecoregion is dominated by spear grass and wheat grass In addition local saline deposits support alkali grass wild barley red sampire and seablite In the separated Cypress Upland fescue and wheatgrass grow below 1000 m and mixed montane forests of lodgepole pine deciduous trees and shrubs grow at higher elevations Larkspur Delphinium sp death camas Zigadenus elegans and wild lupine Lupinus sp are found here and nowhere else in the prairies
The topography is broken by many glacial pothole lakes making this ecoregion the most productive breeding area for waterfowl in the U.S Other wildlife characteristic of the moist mixed grassland are black-tailed and white-tailed deer Odocoileus hemionus and O virginianus pronghorn antelope Antilocapra americana coyote Canis latrans short-horned lizard Phrynosoma douglassi western rattlesnake Crotalus viridis rabbit Sylvilagus sp and sage grouse Centrocercus urophasianus Yellow-rumped warbler Dendroica coronata is also found only in this part of the prairies Bison were once a common feature of this ecoregion
Threats and preservation
The ecoregion provides significant waterfowl production for the continent and is a major staging area It is estimated that up to 80 percent of the wetlands however have been lost or degraded The Cypress Uplands Alberta/Saskatchewan which are believed to have escaped the last glaciation are located in this ecoregion
No completely intact blocks of habitat remain Restoration of some areas is just beginning Few sites are protected


Biovision

The ÅgBiovision Foundation for Ecological DevelopmentÅh is a not-for-profit organisation involved in ecological and sustainable development projects for people living in Africa With its basic principle of Åghelp for self-helpÅh it promotes the preservation of natural resources Biovision is also a global advocate for ecological thinking and action Biovision projects are helping therefore to achieve UN Millennium Development Goals In 2012 Biovision was the first Swiss foundation to be granted General Consultative Status by the United Nations
In 2013 Biovision and its founder Hans Rudolf Herren were awarded the Right Livelihood Award - also known as the Alternative Nobel Prize In its citation the Jury cited HerrenÅfs expertise and pioneering work Ågin promoting a safe secure and sustainable global food supply.Åh
The Foundation
Initially set up in 1998 as an association by the Swiss entomologist Hans Rudolf Herren Biovision has its registered office in Zurich and seeks to bring about sustainable improvements in the living conditions of people in Africa and preserve the natural environment as the basis for life In 2004 and with the same purpose he established the Biovision Foundation a foundation under Swiss Law and so regulated by the FDHA the Swiss Federal Department of Home Affairs
ÅgThe Foundation promotes the preservation of natural resources for present and future generations It supports projects in Switzerland and developing countries in the Third World that promote the sustainable and socially responsible use of natural resources and at the same time serve to promote and preserve the diversity of flora and fauna and encourage ecological thinking and action.Åh
As initial funding Hans Rudolf Herren used the prize money from his 1995 World Food Prize but projects are now funded primarily by membership fees private and institutional donations and legacies In 2013 Biovision had access to more than 8 million Swiss Francs
Vision ? A future for all naturally
Biovision promotes ecological thinking and action in both the global North and South The Foundation is committed to a world with sufficient healthy food for all produced by healthy people in a healthy environment To that end it tackles the root causes of poverty and hunger and promotes the development spread and use of ecological methods that bring about sustainable improvements in living conditions in Africa
Its projects focus mainly on small-scale farmers in Africa Biovision recognizes that this group is crucial if the continent is to provide people with sufficient healthy food manage the agricultural landscapes and in general preserve natural resources
Approach
To underpin development that is both ecological and sustainable Biovision pursues a holistic approach known as Åg4 H plus IÅh 4 H stands for the health of humans animals plants and the environment and the ÅgIÅh stands for the dissemination of information and knowledge In terms of human and animal health Biovision places great emphasis on poverty reduction It uses ecological methods to tackle the root causes of infectious human and animal diseases transmitted by insects In the areas of plant and environmental health a further priority is the spread of organic methods rather than methods that use artificial pesticides or fertilizers In this way it seeks to bring about sustainable improvements in food security and protect eco-systems
Biovision splits its work into three main priorities grassroot projects information projects and advocacy For its grassroot projects Biovision works with local partners to develop and implement scientifically sound approaches to the sustainable use of natural resources Projects are designed not only to improve the living conditions of those directly involved but also to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach The knowledge gained from these projects is then fed into an information programme In this way the practical knowledge gained from such successful approaches is made available to a wider section of the population In turn the experiences gained from the grassroot and information projects feed into its advocacy work so providing Biovision with convincing arguments that allow it to influence international policy In this element of its work Biovision is guided in essence by the recommendations of IAASTD the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge Science and Technology for Development - also known as the World Agriculture Report
Projects
Kenya is a focus country for Biovision Since 1998 Biovision has been supporting various projects there which implement ecological health promotion and agricultural methods The research institute icipe headed for over 10 years by Dr Hans Rudolf Herren also has its headquarters in Nairobi Kenya icipe is active in over 30 African countries and is the main partner organisation of Biovision
Ethiopia has been a focus country of Biovision since 2001 These projects have as their goal the widespread use of ecological methods for health promotion as well as for sustainable agriculture and land use Biovision works with local partner organisations and the regional office of icipe in Addis Ababa In project partnership with Helvetas Biovision also supports the combined program for combating sleeping sickness in East Africa
Tanzania is a key country in Swiss development co-operation which receives support from numerous international donors as well as from non-government organisations Since 2006 Biovision has concentrated its work in Tanzania on preservation of biodiversity and conservational use of natural resources To fulfil this aim Biovision co-operates with the Eastern Arc Mountains Conservation Endowment Fund EAMCEF
Biovision has been active in Uganda since 2009 Biovision supports traditional doctors in the use and cultivation of local medicinal plants and so contributes to the conservation of the biodiversity of the surrounding forests
In accordance with the foundation goal Biovision works for the increased dissemination of ecological thinking and action The wasteful use of natural resources is a global problem Conservation of biodiversity is also not just a local concern For this reason Biovision is engaged in the field of information as well as in cross-national programmes in other countries
With Hans Rudolf Herren as one of its authors and also co-chair Biovision played a significant role in the drafting of the 2008 World Agriculture Report IAASTD At the Earth Summit in Rio Rio+20 Biovision ? together with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations ECOSOC in New York - argued strongly for a change in the course of global agriculture


Miroslav Hubmajer

Miroslav Hubmajer was a Slovenian officer and volunteer in Herzegovina Uprising * 1851 Åı 1910
Hubmajer Miroslav born on 3 January 1851 in Ljubljana died on 1 March 1910 in Sarajevo Trained for a typesetter
worked in Graz Budapest and elsewhere During military service in Austrian army he received rank of reserve lower officer He served as a gunner and was studying the mechanics and applied for several patents When he returned from military service he started working for National Printing House Narodna tiskarna in Ljubljana The printworkers at that time were well organized informed and educated and Miroslav Hubmajer joined the printworkers organization A lot of printworkers volunteered in the Herzegovina uprising as did Miroslav Hubmajer who went to Herzegovina in Mai 1876 At the assembly of rebels in Jamnica was
elected against Peter Mrkonji? later Serbian king Petar I Karadjordjevi? for chief
commander of all rebel troops although he was not recognized as leader of adherents of Peter Mrkonji? The Turks launched at his head high reward In the
Serbo-Turkish war he joined Serbian army became artillery officer and later fled with
Nikola Pa?i? to Bucharest where he founded a lithographic institute Later he got a job in Belgrade and was editor Belgrader Zeitung Together with Vaso Pelagi?em in 1884 writes the declaration for Balkan-Karpathian federation In 1896 he got a job in the regional museum in Sarajevo and was as good expert adviser of
Austro-Hungarian ministry of finance and administrator of the
Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina
Beni Kallay
Hubmajer Miroslav from Ljubljana or Black Miroslav as he was
called by rebels was among all slovenian volunteers in Herzegovina Uprising best known He served as an
artillery NCO in Segedin where he became acquainted with the Serbs He was by
profession a typesetter and when he was 24 year old he joined the
Herzegovina Uprising where he soon acquired the reputation of the hero Stories about
his military achievements thewere circulating among the people of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and also European newspapers wrote about it
Hubmajers first military activities were around Trebinje in
Herzegovina Later he travelled
with dr Kosta Gruji? to Montenegro as delegate of the uprising movement to Montenegrin prince
Nikola to get the support in the war against
Turks The duke Vrbi? Minister of
the Interior kindly accepted them and presented them to all the nobility and
guests on the Montenegrin court Hubmajer received there from duke Vrbi? in
recognition of his merits in the struggle against the Turks a gun belt and
60 bullets Later he was sent to Una region in Bosnia to
start organize and command the uprising in that region Meanwhile it has been recognized by
rebels that individual troops cannot achieve strategic success in battle against
the Turks Therefore gathered in Jamnica west from Una 85
rebel leaders to elect a chief commander and determine the battle plan At this assembly
was also Peter Mrkonji? and some have suggested him for the chief commander
because he was the grandson of Karadjordje and like volunteer bravely fought
in the French army against Prussians and proved his heroism in battle on the
river Loire But volunteers at the assembly were not in accordance the small majority
were supporters of prince Milan of Serbia on opposite side were also supporters of
Peter Mrkonji? who were in the minority and few supporters of Austria Among the
latter leading role was played by Peter Uzelac whom have joined some of the
followers of the prince of Milan and this way he succeeded to prevent the
election of Peter Mrkonji? for the main leader Thus for the head of rebels was
selected slovenian Miroslav Hubmajer As commander he led then fierce battles near Jamnica and tried to
take the Kostajnica When it failed he hit with his troops the Turk troops in
Topola two hours away from Jamnica and succeeded the great victory over them
Under the influence of this victory the rebels oath on the flag that they will
fight to the last rather than to admit and suffer the Turkish dominion
Hubmajer later when in 1876 when Serbia declared war to Turkey participated in
the fighting at Javor and Deligrad Russian general Mikhail Chernyayev
who came with volunteers from Russia to help Serbia and became the chief commander of the
Serbian army has raised him to the rank of lieutenant because of his abilities

HIVE is a robust flexible massively parallel Distributed Computing Environment due to the colocation of both storage and the database of sequence read metadata on the same network The distributed storage layer of software and drivers is the key component for file and archive management and the backbone for the deposition pipeline The data deposition backend allows automatic uploads and downloads of external datasets to HIVE data repositories The metadata database can be used to maintain specific information about short reads obtained from NGS experiments
The honeycomb engine developed for HIVE has the ability to represent objects as either flat files or networked files maintaining the interrelatedness through a novel flat schema Unlike other object oriented databases HIVE implements unified APIs to search view and manipulate data of all types The honeycomb engine also facilitates a highly secure hierarchical access control and permission system allowing determination of data access privileges in a finely granular manner without flooding the security subsystem with a multiplicity of rules The security model designed for sensitive data provides comprehensive control and auditing functionality soon to be approved as FISMA Moderate
Interfaces
HIVE is equipped with a web-portal for user and administrative access The portal's client side applications are built using primarily Javascript and HTML5 CGI requests drive the back-end servers which perform computations using C/C++ native programs
Visualizations
The HTML5 vector scalable graphical engine is the core of the graphical visualization package HIVE provides its own graphical abstraction layer to ensure independence from platform-specific implementations of Object-oriented web applications An interactive event handling layer facilitates interaction with graphical primitives on the screen using mouse and keyboard This functionality enables a user to communicate with a rendered scene send commands or retrieve additional information about visual representations Generic sequence annotation and visualization controls allow the user to create and view sequence annotations obtained from remote resources or as a result of HIVE computational results
Mobile Applications
HIVE Mobile apps have been developed to allow users to check and monitor the statuses of previously launched processes and subsequently restart or stop ongoing computations Current mobile applications include HIVE Genecast which provides Mutation and Gene expression data for 26 cancers in BioMuta and HIVE Pubcast which allows users to browse topics and publications on mobile devices
Performance
Speed
The speed of HIVE-hexagon aligner was measured for alignments of query reads to the corresponding reference genomes of three species hepatitis C virus mycoplasma and human Full viral genome mapping was completed in 12 seconds and full human genome mapping in 23 minutes NOTE The maximum number of CPUs used in these trials is 48
Accuracy
One million synthetic reads were generated directly from genomes with a randomly distributed noise of 0 1 or 5% Genomes used include influenza a bacterial mixture and human HIVE-hexagon fully aligns all error-free reads for influenza and other small organisms with high similarity to the reference
Scalability
The following elements allow extension of HIVE to support expected future data needs


Phyllis M Ryan

Phyllis Milgroom Ryan July 2 1927 - May 5 1992 was a civil rights activist from Brookline Massachusetts Most of her work was concentrated in fair housing welfare reform and prison reform during the 1960s through the 1970s

Social activism
Boston Public School stayout
A series of boycotts against the Boston Public Schools called Stayout for Freedom were organized starting in 1963 to protest segregation of the Boston Public School System The Stayouts began as a way to demonstrate how empty certain public schools in Boston would be if all of the non-white students did not show up Instead of going to school the students went to Freedom Schools where they learned about history of blacks in America civics and civil disobedience as protest Phyllis Ryan her husband William and other fair housing activists in the suburbs of Boston organized their own Stayout because housing practices played a major role in the segregation of schools Instead of non-white students in Boston boycotting their schools students from Boston's predominantly white suburban schools followed the example of earlier Stayouts and were bussed into Roxbury to participate in Freedom Schools Phyllis oversaw the public relations of the event and managed to get the event on the front page of major Boston newspapers

Unionism in Wales

Unionism in Wales describes a strand of thought which favours the continuation of some form of political union between Wales and the other countries of the United Kingdom England Scotland and Northern Ireland Unionism in Wales is characterised by opposition to WalesÅfs independence as a separate state and support for remaining within the United Kingdom
Wales within the Union
Wales was assimilated into England by way of a series of changes and events that occurred between the Norman invasion of Wales starting in 1067 and the Laws in Wales Acts of 1535 and 1542 which effectively annexed the whole of Wales within the Kingdom of England
The political union between the Kingdoms of England and Scotland was created through the Act of Union 1707 This united the two previously independent states which had shared the same monarch in a personal union since 1603 under the Parliament of Great Britain With the Act of Union 1800 the Kingdom of Ireland united with Great Britain to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland After the partition of Ireland through which most of Ireland left the United Kingdom in 1922 the state became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
The history of the Unions is reflected in various stages of the Union Flag which forms the flag of the United Kingdom As a historically fragmented territory and later a possession of England Wales never signed an act of union with any of the other countries of the United Kingdom and is not distinguished from England within the national flag Its position in the Union came about as a result of its relationship with the English Crown It is for this reason that Wales has until recently occupied a more constitutionally ambiguous state than Scotland or Ireland
The establishment of the National Assembly for Wales in 1998 confirmed Wales position as a distinct nation and as a recognised constituent country of the United Kingdom
Support in Wales for the Union
Support in Wales for the Union has historically been strong in part due to the country's strong economic and cultural links to England with which it shares a long border as well as the traditional dominance of the pro-Union Labour Party in Wales most heavily industrialised areas While there was growth in nationalist sentiment there was little appetite for home rule and independence in Wales during the 19th and early 20th centuries at a time when independence movements in Ireland and Scotland were gaining support Support for the Union has since declined somewhat reflected in the political inroads made by pro-independence Plaid Cymru In recent years support for the Union is consistently shown as being at between 85 and 90 per cent of the population A 2001 survey for the Institute of Welsh Affairs found that 11% of people polled favoured independence
Support for the Union and political parties
Political support for the Union is widespread with three of the four major political parties in Wales advocating remaining within the UK Support for the Union is found in political parties on both the right and left of Welsh politics

History of the Albanian Americans in Metro Detroit

The organization Global Detroit stated that the largest group of ethnic Albanians not in Europe is in Metro Detroit As of 2014 4,800 ethnic Albanians live in Macomb County making up the fourth-largest ethnic group and the highest concentration of Albanians in Metro Detroit
History
In 1912 Albanians began arriving in the area They had no peak migration period At the time there were groups in east Detroit northwest Detroit and Grosse Point
The early settlers originated from southern Albania but they were recorded as being from Greece Turkey or from the country in which they boarded their boats to the United States Many had initially lived in New York and New England but moved to Detroit by the 1910s
Frances Trix the author of The Sufi Journey of Baba Rexheb wrote that Detroit's Albanian community was more conservative than that of New York City and that the cohesiveness that crossed religious lines and that manifested itself in gatherings and in unusual generosity to Albanian cultural activities was a factor special to Albanians in Detroit
As of 1951 Metro Detroit had about 3,000 Albanians
A wave of mass immigration came in 1992 with the breakup of Yugoslavia and it continued in the 1990s Some Catholic ethnic Albanians from Montenegro entered the United States from Mexico and settled in Detroit
Geography
In the 1990s ethnic Albanians in Sterling Heights had the nickname Albos and they often had conflicts with Yugos collectively those of ethnic Serb and Macedonian ethnicities
Economy
By 2012 many Albanians were operating Coney islands or restaurants serving the Coney Island hot dog Albanians in general operate many restaurants Many Albanian immigrants are employees in fast food restaurants in Macomb County and Oakland County
Albanian TV of America headquartered in Troy transmits Albanian-language television shows
Religion
In 1929 the St Thomas Orthodox Church was established by Albanian Christians Albanian Muslims assisted the Christians with their mortgage
For a period of time prior to 1949 Hussein Karoub provided pastoral services to the Albanian Muslims In 1949 the first U.S Albanian mosque opened in Detroit The Albanian Moslem Society organized in 1947 established it once it had recruited a cleric This cleric was Vehbi Ismail Ismail accused Karoub of trying to sabotage him
The First Albanian Bektashi Monastery Tekke opened in Taylor in 1953 Baba Rexheb an Albanian Sufi had established it In 1963 the Albanian Islamic Center in Harper Woods opened

The authors Abdo Elkholy Frances Trix and Linda Walbridge all as paraphrased by Sally Howell stated that relations between Albanian Muslims and other Muslims in Detroit were limited at best


Kiran Choudhry

Daughter of a war veteran Brigadier Atma Singh from Kumaon Regiment of Indian Army Kiran Choudhry is a public spirited Congress leader from Haryana She rose through the ranks of the party to become Minister for Excise Taxation and Public Health and Engineering in her State
With nearly three decades of public life now behind her she counts on the late Rajiv Gandhi the most for inspiring her to take a plunge into politics This was way back in 1986 when she joined the womenÅfs wing of the party or All India Mahila Congress as a joint-secretary Ever since she never looked back and successfully contested Delhi Assembly elections in 1998 from Delhi Cantonment She was elected Deputy Speaker of the House unopposed She held the post until the end of the term of the Assembly in 2003
But two years later she was struck by the tragic death of her husband the late Surender Singh in a helicopter crash Son of the former Haryana Chief Minister and IndiaÅfs former Defence Minister Bansi Lal and thus scion of StateÅfs main political family Singh was Minister for Agriculture in Haryana in his own right at the time of his tragic end Soon his mantle fell on her The late MinisterÅfs constituents in Tosham near Bhiwani demanded that someone from the illustrious family should take over the reins of the constituency in the wake of untimely loss of the 59-year-old son of the former Chief Minister in unbelievably tragic circumstances
Byelection that followed in Tosham brought Kiran to the homestead She won the polls with record margin and has ever since been nursing the constituency like her kid Today Tosham is blessed with schools college healthcare centres and almost uninterrupted electricity and water supply This has made Kiran to win the last Vidhan Sabha polls with nearly 50,000 votes Not only this but her daughter Shruti Choudhary was too sent to Parliament in 2009 general elections from Bhiwani-Mahindergarh Lok Sabha constituency under which Tosham falls
The mother-and-daughter duoÅfs success somehow did not go down well in certain powerful quarters and a vicious physical assault was resorted to while Kiran was on a campaign tour in the last general elections held in 2014 She was shifted to a Gurgaon Hospital by her supporters soon after the assault Her daughter also lost the Lok Sabha polls Yet the incident could not deter the valiant duo from doing their bit and more for the voters who invariably look to both as their best bet since the two have set their constituencies onto the road of progress Kiran Choudhry won the Tosham Assembly constituency seat for the third time in a row in 2014 with a margin of 19741 votes at a time when other big leaders of her party were swept away by the Narendra Modi wave and the Congress party lost power with only 15 of its MLAs returning to the Assembly down from its tally of 40 seats in the 2009 assembly polls


Apyornis Island

Apyornis Island or Aepyornis Island is a short story by H G Wells first published in 1894 in the Pall Mall Budget It was included in The Stolen Bacillus and Other Incidents the first collection of short stories by Wells first published in 1895
In the story a man looking for eggs of the Aepyornis an extinct flightless bird passes two years alone on a small island with an Aepyornis that has hatched
Historical background
Aepyornis maximus was a giant flightless bird that lived in Madagascar it became extinct probably because it was hunted excessively by humans The bird was about 3 metres tall and its egg was up to nine litres in capacity Fragments of the eggs are still found
Story summary
The narrator starts a conversation with a fellow Englishman a rough individual named Butcher in an unspecified foreign location Remembering reports of a court case years earlier in which Butcher sued his employer for salary accrued while cast away on a desert island the narrator encourages him to tell the story related to the case
Butcher employed by a collector is engaged in finding Aepyornis eggs He is looking for them in a swamp on the east coast of Madagascar helped by two native assistants in a canoe who are probing the mud with rods They find several whole eggs but one is dropped apparently when an assistant is bitten by something Butcher contemptuous of the natives deals with the matter brutally and he eventually finds himself adrift in the canoe with three Aepyornis eggs his assistants are dead one as a result of the bite and the other shot by Butcher During the days adrift he eats two of the eggs noticing that the embryo of the second egg is developing the tropical heat after centuries in the cold mud is causing this
The canoe drifts onto an atoll The Aepyornis egg hatches Butcher calls the young bird Man Friday after the character in Robinson Crusoe as it is a welcome companion For two years Butcher enjoys the company watching the bird grow and sharing food with it he says to the narrator It was a kind of idyll you might say If only I had had some tobacco it would have been simply just like heaven
Then the bird now about fourteen feet high begins to be aggressive and Butcher has to spend his time in the lagoon or up a palm tree to avoid attacks He eventually manages to kill it He misses the companionship but soon afterwards is rescued from the atoll He sells the bones of the bird to a collector since it is larger than Aepyornis maximus scientists give it the fictitous name Aepyornis vastus


Inglehart?Welzel cultural map of the world

The Inglehart?Welzel cultural map of the world is a map or more precisely a scatter plot created by political scientists Ronald Inglehart and Christian Welzel based on the World Values Survey It depicts closely linked cultural values that vary between societies in two predominant dimensions traditional versus secular-rational values on the vertical y-axis and survival versus self-expression values on the horizontal x-axis Moving upward on this map reflects the shift from traditional values to secular-rational ones and moving rightward reflects the shift from survival values to self-expression values
According to the authors These two dimensions explain more than 70 percent of the cross-national variance in a factor analysis of ten indicators?and each of these dimensions is strongly correlated with scores of other important orientations
The authors stress that socio-economic status is not the sole factor determining a country's location as their religious and cultural historical heritage is also an important factor
Values
Analysis of the World Values Survey data by Inglehart and Welzel asserts that there are two major dimensions of cross-cultural variation in the world
The map is not a geographical map but rather a chart in which countries are positioned based on their scores for the two values mapped on the x-axis survival values versus self-expression values and the y-axis traditional values versus secular-rational values The map shows where societies are located in these two dimensions Clusters of countries reflect their shared values and not geographical closeness
Traditional values emphasize the importance of religion parent-child ties deference to authority absolute standards and traditional family values People who embrace these values also reject divorce abortion euthanasia and suicide Societies that embrace these values have high levels of national pride and a nationalistic outlook
Secular-rational values have the opposite preferences to the traditional values Societies that embrace these values place less emphasis on religion traditional family values and authority Divorce abortion euthanasia and suicide are seen as relatively acceptable
The shift from traditional to secular-rational values has been described by Engelbrekt and Nygren as essentially the replacement of religion and superstition with science and bureaucracy
Survival values place emphasis on economic and physical security They are linked with a relatively ethnocentric outlook and low levels of trust and tolerance
Self-expression values give high priority to subjective well-being self-expression and quality of life Some values more common in societies that embrace these values include environmental protection growing tolerance of foreigners gays and lesbians and gender equality rising demands for participation in decision-making in economic and political life autonomy and freedom from central authority interpersonal trust political moderation and a shift in child-rearing values from emphasis on hard work toward imagination and tolerance
The shift from survival to self-expression also represents the transition from industrial society to post-industrial society as well as embracing democratic values
Clusters
Countries can be divided into nine clusters the English-speaking Latin America Catholic Europe Protestant Europe African Islamic South Asian Orthodox and Confucian ones
Another proposed way to cluster the societies is by wealth with the poor societies at the bottom of both axes and rich at the top
Country-specific analysis
Out of Western world countries the United States is among the most conservative as one of the most downwards-located countries together with highly conservative Catholic countries such as Ireland and Poland Simoni concludes that On the traditional/secular dimension the United States ranks far below other rich societies with levels of religiosity and national pride comparable with those found in some developing societies roughly between Iran and Iraq
Asian societies are distributed in the traditional/secular dimension in two clusters with more secular Confucian societies at the top and more traditional South Asian ones at the center of the map
Russia is among the most survival-value oriented countries and at the other end Sweden ranks highest on the self-expression chart


Innerscope Research

Innerscope Research is an integrated consumer neuroscience research firm founded in 2006 and based in Boston Massachusetts with an office in New York City Using applied neuroscience tools such as biometrics eye tracking facial coding as well as fMRI often integrated with traditional measures of self-report the company aims to measure in a more comprehensive way consumersÅf non-conscious emotional connection to brands products and services
The company services Fortune 500 clients and works in multiple domains using a neuroscience informed framework sometimes referred to as neuromarketing Its research offering includes the evaluation of video advertising shopper marketing media platforms online/mobile user experience as well as a variety of custom studies from testing fragrances to automobile driving experiences InnerscopeÅfs goal is to help its clients understand the role of non-conscious processing in decision making
Company Information
TECHNOLOGIES USED
Innerscope combines conscious and non-conscious research to gain insight of consumersÅf emotional response to media content on various platforms Integrating multiple measurement tools such as facial coding eye-tracking voice analysis fMRI as well as implicit testing combined with the measurements of biometric reactions Innerscope believes that consumer choices are heavily influenced by non-conscious motivators
Working with hardware and software developers Innerscope has developed a proprietary biometric sensor system that measures heart rate skin sweat respiration and motion Worn as a belt the device wirelessly sends the wearerÅfs data to a back-end software platform for analysis on how emotionally engaged participants are with the media they consume
In an effort to gain more data at a lower cost the company developed a neuroscience kiosk system called Sensus which provides marketers with a cost-effective way to gain insights into consumersÅf conscious and non-conscious attitudes and emotions Sensus collects data by combining the biometric measures of heart rate respiration motion skin conductance facial coding and eye-tracking followed by a self-report survey The standalone kiosk system allows marketers to collect data at a variety of entertainment and shopping locations across the U.S
APPLICATION
Brand Immersion Model BIM
With the growth of new media platforms and the development of mobile advertising and media viewing Innerscope has sought to understand the effectiveness of advertising on multiple media platforms used individually and in conjunction with other platforms Innerscope introduced the Brand Immersion Model a new neuroscience-informed model for understanding media engagement in a multi-screen multi-channel environment
Collaborating with companies such as Fox Broadcasting Company and Turner Broadcasting System studies found that emotional engagement was much stronger with television than online viewing but television viewed with similar online content showed the strongest points of engagement Consistent with the model other studies examining the impact of interacting with social media on a second screen while watching TV on a primary screen makes viewers more emotionally engaged than if they were watching alone without social media While in some cases it distracts viewers second screen use also can augment the TV experience
Company History
NOTABLE PROJECTS
Super Bowl Studies
Innerscope annually studies the Super Bowl to identify which ads are most emotionally engaging ? a far better predictor of success than traditional research methods Each year during televisionÅfs most watched event Innerscope collects live biometric data to measure viewersÅf non-conscious responses to advertisements with the goal of understanding advertising effectiveness and consumer behaviors The results of its 2012 Super Bowl study were featured on CNN
In 2014 Innerscope partnered with Time Warner Medialab and Temple University to conduct a study that allowed viewers to watch the Super Bowl in an environment that would resemble a live viewing of the sporting event The research was designed to measure consumer engagement and media habits using biometrics technology in settings like a theater a living room a mock shopping area and eye-tracking stations The researchers then gave ads based on levels of biometric engagement to Temple University to measure the brain activity using fMRI functional magnetic resonance imaging
Path-to-Purchase CampbellÅfs Soup
Innerscope also conducted research concerning path-to-purchase and consumer packaging with companies including Campbell Soup Company The research firmÅfs work played a significant role in Campbell Soup Company redesigning its condensed soup label The research looks at physiological responses such as perspiration and increased heart rate and marketing
HISTORY
The company was founded by Dr Carl Marci and Brian Levine in 2006 out of their relationship at the MIT Media Lab The pair realized their research effectively could predict the outcome of peopleÅfs behaviors using algorithms and biometric technology Innerscope has been recognized with ARF Innovation and Rising Star Awards ESOMAR Best Presentation Award and as a 2013 EXPLOR award finalist at IIRÅfs TMRE

History
It was a flourishing time for Bengal in the second half of the 19th century with prolific intellectual ethical spiritual and philosophical developments that culminated in the Bengali Renaissance From fine arts to commerce from culture to industry from literature to science every aspect of the Bengali identity was in a state of creative flux The burgeoning spirit of this era also had its impact on the world of confectionary with fresh inspiration from Bengali confectioners of the time In the 1860s the man who chose this era to engage his genius was a humble confectioner in a tiny obscure corner of Bagbazar in north Kolkata then known as Sutanotty India His name was Nobin Chandra Das also called ÅeNobin MoiraÅf of Bagbazar and he set up his sweet shop in 1866 currently located on Rabindra Sarani then known as Chitpur Road in Sutanuti Bagbazar However rustic the ambiance of his shop might have been the last thing Nobin Chandra wanted to do was run a mere sales counter His ambition was to create a completely original sweet that would bring new excitement to the Bengali palate and serve as the ultimate delicacy to the rich and poor alike
It was sometime in the year 1868 that his labours finally paid off as he redefined the concept of making a perfect sweetmeat out of fragmented clumps of casein known specifically as ÅgchhanaÅh a variant of cottage cheese from the old Sanskrit word ÅgChinnaÅh due to its crumpled texture and sparse binding capacity It was Nobin ChandraÅfs accomplishment that he was able to create a perfectly homogeneous spherical delicacy that was both spongy and succulent with a unique and distinctive taste through a novel method of processing the ÅgChannaÅh in boiling sugar syrup Nobin Chandra christened this creation the ÅgRossogollaÅh and a legend was born Other variations of ÅgChannaÅh based sweets might have existed in Orissa or other parts of Eastern India but not before the 17th century;as the process and technology involved in synthesizing ÅgChhanaÅh was introduced to the Indians by the Dutch colonists in the 1650s Despite all the controversies the earlier version of these sweets lacked the spherical regularity texture and binding capacity of the modern Rossogolla that is well known and highly acclaimed today This was due to the fact that the know-how involved in synthesizing such a sweet was unknown before being experimentally developed by Nobin Chandra and then constantly improved and further standardized by his successors
It was an innovation of such significance that it earned Nobin Chandra a place among the legends of Bengal Connoisseurs of sweets throughout India remember him as ÅgNobin Moira The Columbus of RossogollaÅh Highbrow Bengalis who had till then used the word ÅgMoiraÅh or confectioner of sweets disparagingly came to lace it with reverence when linking it to Nobin ChandraÅfs name Subsequent generations of sweetmeat manufacturers of Bengal started earning a prominent recognition in society because of his endeavours The word ÅgmoiraÅh itself was redefined by Nobin Chandra during his time as it started to get looked upon by the love and reverence all Bengalis share for their sweets even today
Birth and Beginnings
Nobin ChandraÅfs ancestors were classical sugar merchants involved in indigenous sugar processing and trade They were merchants of considerable social standing in the early 19th Century Originally from the district of Burdwan the Dases had made Kolkata then Calcutta their home for eight generations by then Their house on a horse-shoe bend by the river Ganges in Suttanotty currently on Kashimitra-Ghat Street in Bagbazar was well known even a century ago
By 1846 one year after Nobin Chandra was born in 1845 their traditional business had ceased to flourish Nobin ChandraÅfs father passed away three months before his birth adding to the woes of his family and their sugar business In 1864 driven by poverty and with little provision to complete his education he initially started working for the Indra family sweet confectioners of Shantipur Nadia district They were distant relatives of Nobin Chandra's mother and their shop was located on Chitpur road in Bagbazar Kolkata However it turned out to be a futile venture as Nobin Chandra was humiliated by the Indras and he left the job to start something on his own with fresh motivation There on he started a sweetmeat shop at Jorasanko at the early age of 18 with his close friend and acquaintance Due to the social constraints of his times being from a background of respectable and prosperous sugar merchants the family did not take kindly to Nobin ChandraÅfs decision of becoming a sweetmeat seller His family itself disdainfully referred to him as the ÅgmoiraÅh a profession not held in high esteem in 19th century Bengal However it was unthinkable at that time that history would transform their title of contempt into lasting adulation
Nevertheless Nobin ChandraÅfs Jorasanko business turned out to be a failure as he fell out with his friend Moreover In those days sweetmeat shops depended on credit sales But Nobin Chandra had no resources to offer credit to his customers But he was not a man to give up easily and two years later in 1866 he started a new venture with another shop on Chitpur Road right opposite Indra's mithai shop in Bagbazar where his journey had started Most sweetmeats made then were either ÅgSondesh/SandeshÅh a delicacy exclusively for the affluent which was remolded and popularized by Bhim Chandra Nag or sweets made of ÅgdalÅh lentils or flour from various grains Choices were limited and Åesweet-loversÅf yearned for novelty Nobin Chandra took advantage of this situation to create his own masterpiece
Birth of Rossogolla
In the year 1868 in response to this growing necessity and with a stroke of luck and genius Nobin Chandra altered the fate of Bengali sweets with ÅgRossogollaÅh - his magnum opus It was the ultimate delicacy of his time which could be enjoyed by the rich and poor alike Despite the novelty and appeal of his creation it took some time for Rossogolla to become popular in the absence of advertising and media as we know it today
However as the story goes one particular incident propelled its popularity on the social platform One fine morning a magnificent landau came to a halt at his shop A wealthy businessman Raibahadur Bhagwandas Bagla was in the carriage with his family One of BhagwandasÅf children was thirsty and their carriage had stopped in search of a drink of water Nobin Chandra offered his usual hospitality but with a novelty.The little boy was given water to drink along with Rossogollas The child was so delighted with its unique delicacy that he offered his father The father was equally ecstatic and immediately bought a very large quantity of Rossogollas for his family and friends This unorthodox Åeword of mouthÅf proved a very useful tool of publicity and ÅgNobin MoiraÅfsÅh Rossogolla became famous in no time
Acquaintances and popularity
Stories abound about Nobin ChandraÅfs creative genius When Maharani Swarnamoyee Devi the dowager of the house of Cossimbazar and a regular customer at Nobin Chandra's shop complained that there were no sweets to excite her jaded palate Nobin Chandra whipped up a delectable confection that made the old lady exclaim Åg Abar KhaboÅh i.e I want to eat again This marked the birth of the now famous variant of the time-honoured ÅgsondeshÅh
Nobin ChandraÅfs confections were also hot favourites with the monks of the then new-born Ramakrishna Mission who had set up their monastery in the neighbourhood at Balaram Bose's residence famously regarded as Balaram-Mandir today Rakhal Maharaj Swami Brahmananda the first President of the mission and a close friend and confidant of Swami Vivekananda reportedly once said in jest ÅgNobin has cut off our tongues and holds them hostage.Åh The Dedo Sondesh moulded by Nobin Chandra was a particular favourite of Sri Ma consort of Ramkrishna Paramhansa and to this day this item is regularly sent from of K.C.Das Private Limited as an offering to Sri Ma
Dr Pashupati Bhattacharya a renowned medical practitioner of Bagbazar would invariably buy Nobin Das Rossogolla before visiting Rabindranath Tagore One day the Rossogolla stock was exhausted in Nobin Das shop when Dr Bhattacharya arrived He had to purchase from an adjoining shop Tagore instinctively recognized the difference and asked him to bring Rossogolla from Nobin DasÅf only
Later life and contributions
Contrary to the advice of his friends and admirers to take out patents Nobin Chandra taught the intricacies of Rossogolla-making to numerous sweetmeat makers He was open minded and believed that his creation could only gain popularity if available in all sweet shops across the country
Nobin Chandra was a thoroughly unorthodox Ågmoira,Åh far ahead of his time After he acquired the art of making Rossogolla he diverted his attention to the perfection of sondesh From the granular and course varieties then in vogue he succeeded in making it into a smooth and refined paste and named it ÅgKastura pakÅh He was the first traditional Bengali confectioner to incorporate natural fruit pulp in his creations and Bengalis of the succeeding generations have blessed the creator of the ÅgAata custard apple SondeshÅh and ÅgKathaal jackfruit Sondesh.Åh Another curious example of his creative expression was the way he transformed the broken or crumbled balls of casein left over from the process of making ÅgRossogolla He mixed these crumbs with ÅgkheerÅh and added pistachios raisins and saffron to make a unique kind of ÅgSondeshÅh He christened it ÅgBaikuntha Bhog,Åh which means a creation fit to be served at Vaikunth the abode of the great god Vishnu
Death and legacy
Nobin Chandra left his legacy to his son Krishna Chandra Das 1869-1934 Krishna Chandra enlarged the inheritance of his fatherÅfs genius in the art of Bengali sweetmeats What is more he implanted in his family a spirit of exploration that keeps on seeking new vistas outside the beaten track Krishna Chandra also created the ÅgRossomalaiÅh another perennial favourite To popularize the ÅgRossomalaiÅh Krishna Chandra opened a new sweet shop at Jorasanko in 1930 From there he also introduced the canned Rossogolla which was the first and only canned dessert manufactured in the country at that time Unfortunately Krishna Chandra died within four years of the opening He left the reins in the able hands of his son and successor Sarada Charan Das
The enterprising and energetic Sarada Charan quickly expanded the family business and established a company named K.C Das Private Limited after his father under the Companies Act of 1946 He added to the number of shops in Kolkata beginning with the shop at Esplanade East under his fatherÅfs name in 1935 This was the first time that the shopÅfs name was shortened to the crisper ÅeK C DasÅf from the original Krishna Chandra Das The tradition of innovation continued unbroken with Sarada Charan creating the first sweets for diabetics and the ÅgAmrita Kumbha SondeshÅh an exciting departure from all conventions of shape and taste He also introduced the ÅgSondesh CakeÅh and ÅgIce-cream SondeshÅg in order to compete with western confectionery products and dairy desserts
Sarada CharanÅfs greatest contribution however was not just the final products of confectionery but also the manufacturing process under hygienic conditions He conceived designed and implemented the use of steam generated from a boiler passed through steam-jacketed pans to replace the traditional coal/wood burning stoves and conventional ÅgkadaisÅh He was the true pioneer in modernizing the traditional Indian confectionery industry
Sarada Charan's establishment K.C Das Private limited is a brand well known throughout the nation today as the vanguard among Bengali confectionery industries


Oxygen storage

Methods of oxygen storage for subsequent use span many approaches including high pressures in oxygen tanks cryogenics oxygen-rich compounds and reaction mixtures and chemical compounds that reversibly release oxygen upon heating or pressure change O2 is the second most important industrial gas
Air
Air is the most common source and reservoir of oxygen containing 20.8% This concentration is sufficient for many purposes such as combustion of many fuels corrosion of many metals and breathing of animals Most humans can function at rest with an oxygen level of 15% at one atmosphere pressure a fuel such as methane is combustable down to 12% oxygen in nitrogen
A small room of 10 meter3 has 2.08 meter3 2080 liters or 2.99 kg of oxygen which would occupy 2.62 liters if it was liquid
High pressure
Oxygen tanks containing pressures up to 200 bar / 3000 psi are used for industrial processes including the manufacture of steel and monel welding and cutting medical breathing gas diving and as emergency backup in aircraft
A small steel tank of 16 liters water capacity with a working pressure of 139 bar / 2015 psi holds about 2150 liters of gas and weighs 63 lbs empty
Cryogenic
Liquid oxygen in a cryogenic storage dewar vacuum-insulated flask is used in aerospace submarine and gas industries
Chemical oxygen generators
Chemical oxygen generators store oxygen in their chemical composition and can be used only one time
Oxygen Candles contain a mix of sodium chlorate and iron powder which when ignited smolders at about 600 ÅãC 1,112 ÅãF and results in sodium chloride iron oxide and oxygen about 270 liters per kg of mixture
Some commercial airliners use emergency oxygen generators containing a mixture of sodium chlorate NaClO3 5 percent barium peroxide BaO2 and 1 percent potassium perchlorate KClO4 which after ignition reacts releasing oxygen for 12 to 22 minutes while the unit reaches
The Vika oxygen generating system used on Mir and later the International Space Station under the NASA designation Solid Fuel Oxygen Generator SFOG is based on lithium perchlorate which releases about 60% of its weight in oxygen Of all the perchlorates lithium perchlorate has both the highest oxygen to weight and oxygen to volume ratio except beryllium diperchlorate which is expensive and toxic The Vika system uses a canister containing about 1 liter 2.4 kg of perchlorate to generate 600 liters 0.86 kg of oxygen enough for one person for one day
Chemical oxygen generators containing potassium superoxide were used on the Soyez spacecraft and in some mine safety Self-Contained Self-Rescue SCSR devices KO2 reacts with both H2O and CO2 to produce oxygen and 0.38 kg of oxygen is generated per kg of superoxide
Tetramethylammonium ozonide CH3)4NO3 is proposed as a source of oxygen for generators because of its low molecular weight being 39% oxygen
Reversible chemical absorbers
Scientists at the University of Southern Denmark published a paper on oxygen storage by chemisorption Two molecules of dioxygen are stored into a crystalline salt {(bpbp)CoII2NO3}2(2-amino-1,4-benzenedicarboxylato)(NO3)2ÅE2H2O at 35 Celsius and released by heating to 100 Celsius Bpbp is 2,6-bis(N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)aminomethyl)-4-"tert"-butylphenolato
An analogy of the function of cobalt bound to their organic molecule was made to the function of iron and copper in metalloproteins used for respiration by animals The nitrate anions in the crystal are exchanged with neutral dioxygen but remain in the crystal other anions besides nitrate work similarly and exchange oxygen faster 10 liters of crystals are enough to suck up all the oxygen in a room three times more oxygen than an equivalent sized steel tank


Allah as Moon-god

Allah as Moon-God is a claim put forth by some critics of Islam that the Islamic name for God Allah derives from a pagan Moon god in local Arabic mythology The implication is that Allah is a different God from the Judeo-Christian deity and that Muslims are worshipping a false god The claim is most associated with the Christian apologist author Robert Morey whose book The moon-god Allah in the archeology of the Middle East is a widely cited source of the idea that Allah is a moon-god It has also been promoted in the cartoon tracts of Jack Chick The use of a lunar calendar and the prevalence of crescent moon imagery in Islam is said to be the result of this origination
In 2009 anthropologist Gregory Starrett wrote a recent survey by the Council for American Islamic Relations reports that as many as 10% of Americans believe Muslims are pagans who worship a moon god or goddess a belief energetically disseminated by some Christian activists
Islamic and Western scholars have rejected these claims one even calling them insulting It is argued that Allah is just the word for God in Arabic which ultimately derives from the same root as the Hebrew words El and Elohim both used in the Book of Genesis Sociologist Lori Peek writes that Allah is simply the Arabic word meaning God In fact people who speak Arabic be they Christians Jews or Muslims often say Allah to describe God just as God is called Gott in German and Dieu in French While other gods were certainly referred to using this epithet this is equally true of the Hebrew words The Biblical commandment You shall have no other gods before me uses the same word Elohim to refer to the other gods that is used for the creator god It is also true of the English French and other European-language words for God Indeed the English word God evolved from pagan Germanic terms for invocation the Latin word Deus from which Dieu derives can be traced to the same root as Dyeus which gives the names of the ancient Indo-European divinities Zeus Jove and Dyaus Pitar
Ibrahim Hooper of CAIR calls the Moon-God theories of Allah evangelical fantasies that are perpetuated in their comic books
Etymology
The word Allah certainly predates Islam As Arthur Jeffrey states The 19th-century scholar Julius Wellhausen also viewed the concept of Allah al-ilah the god to be a form of abstraction originating from Mecca's local gods
Alfred Guillaume notes that the term al-ilah the God ultimately derives from the Semitic root used as a generic term for divinity
Guillaume notes that some scholars have argued that the epithet the god was first used as a title of a moon god but this is purely antiquarian in the same sense as the origins of the English word god Some scholars trace the name to the South Arabian Ilah a title of the Moon god but this is a matter of antiquarian interest...it is clear from Nabataean and other inscriptions that Allah meant the god
The word Allah was used by Arabic-speaking Christians and Arab Jews before the lifetime of Muhammad as the word for God It was also used by pre-Muslim Arab monotheists known as hanifs
Crescent moon imagery
The moon plays a significant role in Islam because of the use of a lunar Islamic calendar to determine the date of Ramadan The crescent moon known as Hilal defines the start and end of Islamic months The need to determine the precise time of the appearance of the hilal was one of the inducements for Muslim scholars to study astronomy The Quran clearly emphasises that the moon is a sign of God not itself a god Muslim scholars cite the 37th verse of the Sura Fussilat as proof against the Moon-God claim
The crescent moon symbol used as form of blazon is not a feature of early Islam as would be expected if it were linked to Pre-Islamic pagan roots The use of the crescent symbol on Muslim flags originates during the later Middle Ages 14th-century Muslim flags with an upward-pointing crescent in a monocolour field included the flags of Gabes Tlemcen Tilimsi Damas and Lucania Cairo Mahdia Tunis and Buda
It has been suggested that the star-and-crescent had been adopted from the Byzantines Franz Babinger suggests this possibility noting that the crescent alone has a much older tradition also with Turkic tribes in the interior of Asia Parsons considers this unlikely as the star and crescent was not a widespread motif in Byzantium at the time of the Ottoman conquest
Turkish historians tend to stress the antiquity of the crescent not star-and-crescent symbol among the early Turkic states in Asia In Turkish tradition there is an Ottoman legend of a dream of the eponymous founder of the Ottoman house Osman I in which he is reported to have seen a moon rising from the breast of a Muslim judge whose daughter he sought to marry When full it descended into his own breast Then from his loins there sprang a tree which as it grew came to cover the whole world with the shadow of its green and beautiful branches Beneath it Osman saw the world spread out before him surmounted by the crescent
Islamic flags containing the calligraphy of the Quran were commonly used by the Mughal Emperor Akbar it was the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan who is known to have inlaid the Crescent and Star symbol upon his personal shield his son Aurangzeb is also known to have used similar shields and flags containing an upward Crescent and Star symbol Various Nawabs also preferred to utilize the Crescent and Star symbols such as the Nawab of the Carnatic
Hubal and Allah
In Christian fundamentalism
Before Islam the Kaaba contained a statue representing the god Hubal which was thought to have powers of divination Robert Morey's book The Moon-god Allah in the Archeology of the Middle East claims that Allah is identical in origin to Hubal who he asserts to be a lunar deity This teaching is repeated in the Chick tracts Allah Had No Son and The Little Bride It has been widely circulated in Evangelical and anti-Islamic literature in the United States In 1996 Janet Parshall in syndicated radio broadcasts asserted that Muslims worship a moon god In 2003 Pat Robertson stated The struggle is whether Hubal the Moon God of Mecca known as Allah is supreme or whether the Judeo-Christian Jehovah God of the Bible is Supreme
Farzana Hassan sees these views as an extension of longstanding Christian Evangelical claims that Islam is pagan and that Muhamamad was an impostor and deceiver
Literature circulated by the Christian Coalition perpetuates the popular Christian belief about Islam being a pagan religion borrowing aspects of Judeo-Christian monotheism by elevating the moon god Hubal to the rank of Supreme God or Allah Muhammad for fundamentalist Christians remains an impostor who commissioned his companions to copy words of the Bible as they sat in dark inaccessible places far removed from public gaze
Scholarly views
These claims draw to some extent on historical secular scholarship about the origins of the Islamic view of Allah and the polytheism of pre-Islamic Arabia which date back to the nineteenth century These concern the evolution and etymology of Allah and the mythological identity of Hubal On the basis that the Kaaba was Allah's house but the most important idol within it was that of Hubal Julius Wellhausen considered Hubal to be an ancient name for Allah in 1905 David Samuel Margoliouth wrote that Between Hubal the god whose image was inside the Ka'bah and Allah the God of whom much will be heard there was perhaps some connection but argued that Wellhausen's equation of the two was merely hypothetical
The claim that Hubal is a moon god derives from the speculation of the German scholar Hugo Winckler in the early twentieth century Recent authors do not identify Hubal as a god of the moon David Leeming describes him as a warrior and rain god as does Mircea Eliade Islamic sources make no mention of the moon in connection with Hubal Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi's Book of Idols describes the idol as a human figure with a gold hand replacing the original hand that had broken off the statue He had seven arrows that were used for divination
More recent authors emphasise the Nabataean origins of Hubal as a figure imported into the shrine which may have already been associated with Allah Patricia Crone argues that If Hubal and Allah had been one and the same deity Hubal ought to have survived as an epithet of Allah which he did not And moreover there would not have been traditions in which people are asked to renounce the one for the other
Islamic views
Many of these theories are consistent with mainstream Islamic thought which holds that worship of Allah was passed down through Abraham and other prophets but that it became corrupted by pagan traditions in pre-Islamic Arabia Before Muhammad Allah was not considered the sole divinity by Meccans however Allah was considered the creator of the world and the giver of rain The notion of the term may have been vague in the Meccan religion Allah was associated with companions whom pre-Islamic Arabs considered as subordinate deities Meccans held that a kind of kinship existed between Allah and the jinn Allah was thought to have had sons and that the local deities of al-ÅeUzza Man?t and al-L?t were His daughters The Meccans possibly associated angels with Allah Allah was invoked in times of distress Muhammad's father's name was meaning the slave of All?h
Hubal versus Allah
Islamic scholars argue that Muhammad's role was to restore the purified Abrahamic worship of Allah by emphasising his uniqueness and separation from his own creation including phenomena such as the moon The alleged miracle of the splitting of the moon shows that God is not the moon but has power over it Whether or not Hubal was even associated with the moon both Muhammad and his enemies clearly identified Hubal and Allah as different gods their supporters fighting on opposing sides in the Battle of Badr Ibn Hisham notes that Abu Sufyan ibn Harb leader of the defeated anti-Islamic army called to Hubal for support to gain victory in their next battle
Likewise Sahih al-Bukhari clearly differentiates between the worshippers of Allah and the worshippers of Hubal referring to the same event
In Islamic fundamentalism
In 2001 Osama bin Laden called America the modern Hubal He referred to allies of America as hypocrites who all stood behind the head of global unbelief the Hubal of the modern age America and its supporters Al-Qaeda's then-number two Ayman al-Zawahiri repeated the phrase hubal al-'asr in describing America during his November 2008 message following Barack Obama's election to the presidency
According to Adnan A Musallam this use of Hubal as a symbol of the modern worship of idols as un-Islamic gods can be traced to one of the founders of radical Islamism Sayyid Qutb who used the label to attack secular rulers such as Nasser It may have been passed on to bin Laden by one of his teachers Abdullah Azzam

The Boat Race 1963

The 109th Boat Race took place on 23 March 1963 Held annually the event is a side-by-side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames The race umpired by Gerald Ellison the Bishop of Chester was won by Oxford with a winning margin of five lengths
Background
The Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford sometimes referred to as the Dark Blues and the University of Cambridge sometimes referred to as the Light Blues The race was first held in 1829 and since 1845 has taken place on the Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions having won the previous year's race by five lengths and led overall in the event with 60 victories to Oxford's 47 excluding the dead heat of 1877
Cambridge's coaches were Harry Almond who rowed for Cambridge in the 1950 and 1951 races Tony Butcher who rowed in the 1947 race for Cambridge David Jennens who rowed three times between 1949 and 1951 and Charles Lloyd who also rowed three times from 1949 to 1951 Oxford were coached by R M A Bourne who represented Oxford in the 1946 and 1947 races Ronnie Howard who rowed twice in the 1957 and 1959 races Mike Nicholson the non-rowing boat club president of Cambridge in 1947 Antony Rowe who had rowed in the 1948 and 1949 races and E R Spencer During practice rows at Putney Cambridge experienced a number of crabs and while the crew demonstrated a nervous disability to cope with rough water they had the quicker start
The race was umpired by Gerald Ellison Bishop of Chester who had rowed for Oxford in the 1932 and 1933 races
Crews
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 13?st 0.125?lb 82.4?kg over per rower more than their opponents Cambridge's crew contained just a single rower with Boat Race experience in the boat club president and stroke Lord Chewton while Oxford saw Richard Morton David Skailes and cox Christopher Strong return Four rowers two from each university were registered as overseas participants in the race Oxford's Philip Roff was Australian while D Spencer was American and Cambridge's B Jackson was South African while John Haasland hailed from New Zealand Oxford's boat club president Toby Tennant had removed himself from the crew two weeks prior to the race as a result of a lack of form
A correspondant for The Times noted that although there has never been the slightest possibility that the Cambridge crew would be of really first rate the hard work had produced a presentable University crew Meanwhile although Oxford had no stars and had arrived at Putney as an unusually backward crew progress during practice made for definite improvement
Race
Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station handing the Middlesex side of the river to Cambridge The race commenced at 11.30am in a fresh north-north-westerly wind As had been anticipated Cambridge took an early lead and were three-quarters of a length ahead after the first minute of the race Continuing at a higher stroke rate than Oxford in the second minute the Light Blues were almost clear by the end of the Fulham Wall Still nearly a length behind by the Mile Post Oxford cox Strong began to steer towards Cambridge forcing them towards the centre of the river narrowly avoiding a warning from the umpire
Level by Harrods Furniture Depository Oxford were half a length up by Hammersmith Bridge increasing to over a length by The Doves pub despite an almost despairing spurt from Cambridge The lead was three and a half lengths by Chiswick Steps and four and a half by Barnes Bridge Oxford won by five lengths in a time of 20 minutes 47 seconds the slowest time since the 1951 race It was the Dark Blues first victory in three years and took the overall record to 60?48 in Cambridge's favour

Garrett Dillon

Garrett or Gerald Dillon c.1640-c.1696 was an Irish judge politician and soldier who held the office of Recorder of Dublin He is mainly remembered today as one of the signatories of the Treaty of Limerick
He was born in County Westmeath son of Theobald Dillon of Portlick Castle and his wife Marcella Browne Theobald was the son of Garrett Dillon of Feamore County Mayo member of a junior branch of the family of Viscount Dillon Garrett inherited both Feamore and Portlick and acquired other estates in Westmeath and Mayo these were all forfeited in the 1690s but his eldest son Theobald recovered at least a portion of them
He entered Gray's Inn in 1669 and was called to the Irish Bar in 1674 The Roman Catholic King James II of England who succeeded to the throne in 1685 adopted a conscious policy of appointing as many Catholics as possible to high office Dillon was described as a furious Catholic and on that account was acceptable to the King His rise was rapid he became King's Counsel and Recorder of Dublin in 1685 and Prime Serjeant in 1687 In the so-called Patriot Parliament of 1689 he sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Mullingar On the outbreak of the Williamite War in Ireland he entered the military service on King James's side and was made a colonel
After the defeat of the Jacobite cause the new King William III of England was anxious to conciliate as many of his former enemies as possible The result was the Treaty of Limerick which was strictly speaking two treaties military and civil Dillon who had been dismissed from all his offices was one of the three lawyers along with John Brown and Sir Toby Butler who negotiated the civil articles on behalf of the defeated Jacobite side although Butler is said to have done most of the work
The articles were signed by Dillon and his colleagues on 3 October 1691 the terms were surprisingly generous to the defeated side In particular it was provided that those Jacobites who swore an oath of loyalty to the new regime who be permitted to retain their lands Unfortunately for the Jacobites the Parliament of Ireland was not prepared to abide by the Treaty which it regarded as far too generous to the Jacobites Life for Catholics who had supported King James became increasingly difficult while his co-signatories Butler and Brown were left in peace Dillon was proscribed and left the country He joined King James in France and became a colonel in his regiment in 1693 He died a few years later greatly mourned according to Burke as a man of integrity eloquence learning and worth
Dillon married firstly in 1677 Susanna Clifford widow of Sir Edward Crofton 1st Baronet of Moate who had died in 1675 and secondly before 1690 Mary Hamilton younger daughter of George Hamilton 4th Baron Hamilton of Strabane and Elizabeth Fagan by whom he had several children including Theobald his heir

Production
Sky Bride was able to weave a fictional story into a depiction of the stunt pilots who were part of the barnstorming circuit of the 1920s All over North America skilled pilots many of them veterans of the aerial combats of World War I plied their trade in small towns where impromptu air shows were staged Principal photography for Sky Bride began February 1932 at the Metropolitan Airport and Chatsworth Los Angeles studios in the San Fernando Valley California
Essential to telling the story of barnstormers was the use in Sky Bride of a seven-pilot team of Associated Motion Picture Pilots led by Leo Nomis and later Frank Clarke On February 5 1932 the production was halted when lead pilot Nomis was killed while performing a stunt He had been seriously injured weeks earlier in a race track accident while driving as a stunt double in The Crowd Roars 1932 Although not fully recovered from his injuries Nomis tried to fly a difficult spin and landing over railway tracks Although he completed the stunt twice a fiery exchange by the director who demanded a perfect stunt with the aircraft rolling to a stop directly in front of the cameras forced the normally imperturbable Nomis to try the stunt a third time The fatal crash was most probably caused by his inability to fly in complete control partly because of his injuries and partly because he was upset at his treatment by the director
Reception
Sky Bride was primarily a B film and although aerial scenes were notable fell short in other aspects The New York Times review said the film falls short of being good entertainment It is too argumentative and several of the flying scenes are unnecessarily lengthy


Mehar Singh pilot

Air Commodore Mehar Singh MVC DSO 20 March 1915?11 March 1952 was a fighter pilot acknowledged as one of the persons who gave the Indian Air Force its ethos of selfless service He is affectionately known as Mehar Baba a sobriquet coined by Aspy Engineer in IAF circles
Early life and career
Mehar Singh was born on 20 March 1915 at Lyallpur now known as Faisalabad in Pakistan He was selected for the Royal Air Force College Cranwell RAFC England in 1933 while he was in the final year of a B.Sc and joined in 1934 He performed exceedingly well at Cranwell which impressed college authorities
Air Vice Marshall H M Grave Commandant RAFC wrote of Singh
Singh was commissioned as a Pilot Officer in August 1936 and posted to No.1 Squadron then the only squadron in the Royal Air Force RAF It was raised on 1 April 1933 at Karachi with four Westland Wapiti aircraft The Indian element consisted of six officers and nine technicians then known as ÅeHawai SepoysÅf Singh was amongst the first six pioneering officers who joined the squadron Flight Lieutenant C A Bouchier DFC an officer of the Royal Air Force RAF was the first Commanding officer of the Squadron
Singh won the awe and adulation of both seniors and men under him during his association with the Indian Air Force Air Marshal Asghar Khan an officer under Singh in the pre-partition Royal Indian Air Force who later became the Chief of Air Staff of the Pakistan Air Force once said
In 1937 Flying Officer Singh and his air gunner Ghulam Ali were attacking a tribal post at Shaider when his fuel tank was hit by rifle fire He had to crash-land the Wapiti in rocky terrain and had to evade the hostile tribesman searching for them to make it back to the Army lines It was late in the afternoon Singh and Ali extricated the Lewis gun and took refuge in a cave as hostile tribesmen searched for them At nightfall the airmen walked back without maps evading the hostiles and returned safely

Jeju black cattle

Jeju Black Cattle are one of the indigenous cattle breeds found in the Korean peninsula Republic of Korea Since the prehistoric age this breed has survived in the subtropical environment of Jeju island a special self-governed province of Republic of Korea Evidences found in the ancient documents the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty- the annual records of Joseon Dynasty and the Tamna Sullyeokdo- the paintings depicting JejuÅfs official affairs during the Joseon Dynasty about existence of Jeju Black Cattle described that beef of this indigenous cattle was served to the King or used as ritual offerings
Although a prehistoric existence there was a substantial shrink in its population size in Jeju island and been categorized as endangered until 1980s In the last few decades South Korean government policies in agricultural industry focused on automation and increased agri-product outputs which had also driven most industrial interest to breeding of the major local beef source known as Hanwoo cattle ÅeKorean Native CattleÅf or ÅeHan-uÅf than other indigenous breeds such as Jeju Black Cattle For years as a consequence this indigenous breed has lost its economic importance to cattle farmers presumably because of their impaired growth performances in absence of systematic breeding schemes
In the early 1990s however Jeju Stockbreeding Promotion Institute Jeju SPI took initiatives for implementation of a full-fledged preservation and proliferation policy targeting Jeju Black Cattle To date a total of 150 Jeju Black Cattle are being reared under the care of Jeju SPI In 2013 Korean government formally declared the cattle breed as a valuable but an endangered animal genetic resource in the country and sanctioned a Natural Monument No 546 to emphasize its better conservation and proliferation Besides that a total of 619 Jeju Black Cattle has already been registered in the Korean seedstock database system of the Korea Animal Improvement Association
Breed characteristics
Body conformation
Jeju Black Cattle are humpless relatively smaller in body size and body length short and slender legged compared to other indigenous Korean cattle and coated with black hairs over their entire body Their foreheads are broad ears are upright short and round Dewlaps on their briskets are rarely found Horns are found in various types and some of them have two colors black on outer sides and white on the inner sides also similar to Mishima cattle in Japan
The average height at wither of mature bulls and cows at 36 months of age are 137 cm and 125 cm respectively Also their average body lengths found are 154 cm and 140 cm respectively On average the body weight of mature bulls and cows are about 600 kg and 380 kg respectively
Breeding
Sexual maturity age at first heat of heifer calves of Jeju Black Cattle is attained at about 15 months of age The duration of estrus cycle is 20 days approximately without seasonal variation Average gestation length is about 280 days Currently most of them are bred through artificial insemination or embryo transfer
Climatic adaptability and disease resistance
They show superior vigor and endurance in the local climate They show strong tolerance during winter season however exhibit less tolerance in the heat of summer mostly alike to many Bos taurus cattle breeds They are also generally resistant to many common bovine diseases and parasites i.e ticks or mites which especially favor their grazing under subtropical environments
Meat characteristics
Jeju Black Cattle beef was once served to the king because of its excellent taste It has an excellent texture and marbling Loin muscle of these cattle is thin and has delicate deposit of fat particles contributing to its rich flavor and tenderness Jeju Black Cattle beef is especially richer in oleic acid linoleic acid and unsaturated fatty acids than beef of Korean native cattle Han-u It is therefore appraised as a potential well-being food with excellent taste approved by gourmet panels
History
The first historic painting of Jeju Black Cattle was found on a mural of an ancient tomb named Anak Tomb No 3 during the Goguryeo Dynasty in 357 A.D There also exist ancient documents the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty and several others that described the shapes of cattle breeds History of breeding of Jeju Black Cattle in Jeju island dated back to 1702 A.D during the 28th year reign of King Sookjong The administrator of Jeju-mok regional office at that period known as Yi Hyeong-sang surveyed around whole Jeju island and those records were collected in Tamna Sullyeokdo According to his report there were a total of 703 black cattle raised at that time in the island Also recent scientific evidences based on DNA analysis of bones recovered from Gonae-ri and Gwakji-ri in Aewaleup Jeju City were provided by a professor in Jeju National University Oh et al 2005 that ancestors of the present Jeju Black Cattle had been raised by human since prehistoric age
However Jeju Black Cattle became endangered slowly with course of time Since 1992 scientists in Jeju Stockbreeding Promotion Institute have collected Jeju Black cattle which were scattered at private farms in Jeju island and managed as a group of genetic resource They are also carrying out preservation/ proliferation projects As per their project goals expectations if succeed there will be over 600 of these black cattle in Jeju area in near future Jeju SPI also developed a breed discrimination tool using genetic markers This tool has been applied to retain the uniqueness of the Jeju Black Cattle breed In 2013 Republic of Korean government acknowledged the historical and cultural values of Jeju Black Cattle and assigned it Natural Monument No 546 of National Cultural Property to prevent extinction and preserve the breed The Korea Animal Improvement Association which mainly functions for management of individual identification and pedigree information of seedstock animal owned either by institutions or private breeders also manages breeding herd information of Jeju Black Cattle in their registration database system which is open to public

Microfadeometry

Microfadeometry is a technique that uses tiny spots of intense light to probe and measure color changes in objects of art that are particularly sensitive to light exposure
This process is completed using a recently designed instrument known as a microfading tester The data from the test is represented by a reflectance spectra
History
Light-fastness testing dates back to as early as 1733 In the late 19th century with early art conservation studies Russell and Abney published Action of Light on Watercolors in 1888 sparking a concern with light and the aging of cultural materials Microfading as a technique was first identified in Paul WhitemoreÅfs lab book entry on September 21 1994 His work on the topic was later published in 1999
Application
Before the creation of this technique recording light-stability information directly from the objects was nearly impossible Through the use of microfading technology it is now possible to obtain both information about the chemical characterization of the dyes and the associated kinetics of color change
Benchtop microfaders and microfading testers are used to test and analyze light damage on cultural objects and potential light damage to objects in museum collections
Theory
Using a powerful xenon arc lamp 1 lumen of light is focused through a optical fiber onto a 300-400 É m spot of the objectÅfs surface The reflected light is collected by a second fiber optic The period of exposure is monitored with a probe that transforms the reflectance spectrum into color coordinates in real-time A typical microfading test is achieved in less than 10 minutes and replicates exposures equivalent to 5?12 years of display at normal museum light levels The output of the xenon arc lamp is kept at a constant by an exposure controller while it is filtered to 400-710?nm using a water filter The spectrum is then used to quantify the amount of time it would take for the color change to result in a noticeable difference This information is used to retrofit display conditions and improve the protection of vulnerable objects
Calibration of the instrument is achieved by using internal standards such as the Blue Wool Scale
Reliability
Concerns associated with microfading techniques include diffusion-limited photo-oxidation reaction rates dehydration and heating of the sample the variability of using and measuring ISO Blue Wool Standards variation in spectral power distribution between lamps used in object display and the lamp used in accelerated light aging the small sampling area the required number of sample the length of fading time and the potential interaction of individual chemical components of the object tested
Institutional Use
Cultural institutions that house their own instruments for microfadeometry are Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh the Library of Congress and the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC the Museum of Modern Art in New York the Canadian Conservation Institute in Ottawa the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Art Conservation Department at Buffalo State College in New York


Symphony for Solo Piano Alkan

The Symphony for Solo Piano is a large-scale romantic work for piano composed by Charles-Valentin Alkan and published in 1857
Although it is generally performed as a self-contained work it comprises studies Nos 4-7 from the Douze etudes dans tous les tons mineurs Twelve Studies in all the minor keys Op 39 each title being prefaced by the word Symphonie French Symphony The four movements are titled Allegro Marche Funebre Menuet and Finale Much like the Concerto for Solo Piano the Symphony is written so as to evoke the broad pallete of timbres and harmonic textures available to an orchestra It is an early example of a Piano symphony In the opinion of Francois Luguenot it does not contain the excesses of the Concerto or the Grande Sonate Op 33 But rather like the Sonatine Op 61 it proves that Alkan was also capable of writing perfectly balanced and almost ÅeClassicalÅf works Unlike a standard classical symphony each movement is in a different key rising in progressive tonality by a perfect fourth
Description
Allegro
The opening movement in C minor communicates the rich sound of an orchestra in various ways At times Alkan mimics a string section's rapid bowing or tremolos beneath a melody In other instances one can hear the timpani in a sequence of marching staccato chords in the left hand
Although written in Sonata form the thematic material of the Allegro is almost entirely derived from the opening theme which appears in octaves in the left hand This first theme can be subdivided into two sections that are transformed in many ways throughout the rest of the movement A noteworthy feature is its syncopation against the bar line an effect that Alkan uses throughout the movement to heighten the dramatic quality of the music The contrasting second theme is more joyful and light-hearted The development section elaborates at length on the two halves of the first theme In one climactic moment of the recapitulation both hands play full 5-note chords made up of stacked minor thirds in quick succession creating an explosive auditory texture across the range of the piano After a brief coda the closing chords converge to C major before taking one last unexpected step into C minor
Marche Funebre
The second movement is in ABA form with a legato melody over staccato chords in the A section and a lyrical chorale in the B section
Francois Luguenot wrote
The second movement consists of a Funeral March in F minor rather Mahlerian in style In the original edition the title page read ÅeSymphonie No 2 Marcia funebre sulla morte dÅfun Uomo da beneÅf words which have sadly been lost in all subsequent editions Of course one is reminded of the subtitle of the ÅeMarcia funebreÅf in BeethovenÅfs third symphony But might we not regard this Åeuomo da beneÅf as AlkanÅfs father Alkan Morhange who died in 1855 two years before these studies were published
Jack Gibbons wrote The funeral march's sense of restraint is borne out by Alkan's marking over the gentle central section with contained sorrow The distant drum roll that interrupts the march near its closeadds an Alkanesque sense of disquiet to this already sombre music
Menuet
The Menuet is in ABA form like the Marche Funebre and has a strong rhythmic quality and distinctive syncopation
Francois Luguenot writes that the Minuet in B flat minor is in fact a scherzo that anticipates shades of Bruckner?full of energy and brightened by a lyrical trio Adrian Corleonis suggests that Berlioz and Haydn are in closest proximity in the hectic Minuet combining the spirit of the Ronde du Sabbat and Marche au Supplice from the former's Symphonie Fantastique with a palpable debt to the Minuet from the latter's Les Quintes Quartet Op 76/2 which Alkan transcribed
Finale
The final movement is extremely technically demanding This is due not only to the need to play large leaps and arpeggiated figures at a very high speed but also for the sheer endurance required to continuously play them The left hand in particular must play passages of octaves with leaps as large as a 10th A typical performance lasts between 4 and 5 minutes
Luguenot comments that the final Presto in E flat minor memorably described by Raymond Lewenthal as a Åeride in hellÅf brings the work to a breathless close
Reception
In the opinion of Jack Gibbons
That music of this quality has remained neglected in the 150 or so years since its creation is a shocking scandal Alkan performed extracts of the work himself at his series of Petits Concerts in Paris in the 1870s but the next notable performance wasn't until 1938 when Egon Petri performed the Symphony for BBC radio in London Gramophone recordings of the work didn't appear for another 25 years and though today the work is performed more often than at any time in the past its appearance in a concert programme is still unusual

Gelae

Gelae pronounced is a genus of round fungus beetles belonging to the family Leiodidae The beetles are found in different parts of Central and North America They are small and rounded feeding on slime moulds They were originally placed in the genus Agathidium following the discovery of the first species G cognatum in 1878 The taxonomic position was revised with description of new species in 2004 by American entomologists Kelly B Miller and Quentin D Wheeler Upon creation of the new genus the five new species are Gelae baen sounding like jelly bean G balae jelly belly G donut jelly doughnut G fish jelly fish and G rol jelly roll
Discovery and taxonomy
The first species of Gelae discovered was Agathidium cognatum now Gelae cognatum John Lawrence LeConte discovered the only specimen at Marquette Michigan near Lake Superior in 1878 Another specimen was found by Andrew Matthews in 1887 from the mountains of Totonicapan in Guatemala and placed it under the then known genus Agathidium Henry Clinton Fall collected the third species in 1934 from Sugar Pine California US In 1998 Stewart Blaine Peck Pedro Gnaspini and Alfred F Newton Jr reported the occurrence of closely related but distinct species from their extensive cataloguing of round fungus beetles They noted that the species had unique features different from Agathidium and other beetles and labelled them under Undescribed Genus 7 With reexamination of the tribe Agathidiini to which they belong they were reclassified under a new genus Gelae in 2004 Kelly B Miller and Quentin D Wheeler described their significant characters and regrouped them along with five new species G baen G balae G donut G fish and G rol They derived the name from a Latin word gelatus whicn means congealed or jellied and to be pronounced like the English word jelly This refers to the slime moulds in which they were found The species names are merely wordplays without any taxonomical jargon and are simply whimsical arrangement of letters as the authors noted

Metal profiles

Metal profile sheet systems provide an efficient attractive and reliable solution to the building envelope needs of single storey building Over the years these systems have evolved from the single skin metal cladding often associated with agricultural buildings to highly developed systems used in industrial retrial and leisure applications However as with all construction components the ability of the cladding to satisfy its functional requirements is dependent on its correct specification and installation and equally as important on its interaction with the other elements of the building envelope and structure
History
Trapezoidal profiles and cassettes have been known in Europe for around 100 years Today's popular characteristic profile shape came to Europe from the USA in the 50s and has steadily and noticeably gained in relevance since about 1960 At the present moment the proportion of load bearing room sealing trapezoidal profiles used in the overall area of all new and slightly sloping roofs amounts to 90% Above all else the wide acceptance has resulted from the simple constructive training the easy fast assembly the appealing formal style and last but not least the economicalness of the trapezoidal profile construction
Description
Metal profile sheets are metal structural members that due to the fact they can have different profiles with different heights and different thickness engineers and architects can use them for a huge variety of buildings from a simple industrial building to a high demand design building
Trapezoidal profiles are large metal structural members which thanks to the profiling and its thickness retain their high load bearing capability They have been developed from the corrugated profile The profile programme offered by specific manufacturers covers a total of approx 60 profile shapes with different heights
Cassettes are components that are mainly used as the inner shell in dual-shell wall constructions They are mainly used in walls today even though they were originally designed for use in roofs
Specification of the metal profile
Weathertightness
The primary function of the cladding system is to provide a weathertight building envelope suitable for the intended use of the building
Trapezoidal metal roof sheets with through fix fasteners are generally suitable for slopes of 4% or steeper This limit is critical to the performance of the cladding For shallower pitches down to 1 5% a fix system with no exposed through fasteners special side laps and preferably no end laps should be used For low pitch roof ponding is a potential problem that must be considered at the design stage in order to avoid the deleterious effects of prolonged soaking and the increased loading due to the weight of the water
Building appearance
Building envelope made from metal sheet provide builders and architects with products which meet all of the highest demand regarding construction characteristics and design The steel from which profiled cladding sheets are made is available pre-coated in a wide range of colors and textures allowing architects to choose a finish that best suits the location and function of the building Profile shape is also a characteristic that can be adapted to the demand of the architects
Thermal performance
Buildings are responsible of the 40% of European energy consumption consequently improving the thermal performance of the cladding and associated components is very important The elemental U-value thermal transmittance W/m2K of a cladding panel depends on the conductivity and thickness of the insulation which is added the profile shape and the presence of thermal bridges
So metal profile sheets can achieve thermal performance regulations thanks of insulations and profile shape
It is very important to analyze and avoid all possible thermal bridges within the roof and wall cladding assembly to minimize local heat/cold losses
Acoustics
Roofs constructed with trapezoidal profiles have excellent sound suppression characteristics The sound reduction assessments of up to 53?dB have been realised
The measured sound reduction for wall constructions using cassettes has been assessed at an RW of 57?dB
The acoustic performance of a particular cladding system will depend on the insulation material the weather sheet and liner sheet profiles and the method of assembly
To minimize reverberation architects may take advantage of the sound absorbing properties of the cladding insulation layer by replacing the standard liner sheet with a perforated liner
Durability
In order to ensure that the building envelope remains fully functional throughout its design life it is important that it receives regular maintenance including inspection removal of debris cleaning and repair of damage The need of maintenance may be greatly reduced using specific coating depending on the weather conditions this coating guarantee the expected design life of the cladding
Sustainability
Metal profiles sheets have a high recycled scrap steel content and all steel is recyclable Many steel components can be unbolted and even reused for future applications The possibility of reusing building elements makes steel construction even more sustainable than the already significant contribution of todayÅfs simple material recycling Steel can be repeatedly recycled because it does not lose any of its inherent physical properties as a result of the recycling process
Structural performance
Metal cladding systems are required to carry externally applied loads such as snow and wind loading without deflecting excessively or compromising the other performance requirements The individual characteristic loads actions should be obtained from the appropriate part of EN 1991 taking into account the building geometry and location as applicable These individual actions should then be combined using the appropriate safety factors from EN 1990 to obtain the load cases used in design
For most application of metal cladding technology the only permanent action which the roof cladding needs to be designed is its own self-weight
For wall cladding it is not normally necessary to consider permanent actions since the self-weight acts in the plan of the cladding
In addition to its self-weight the roof cladding must also be designed for the following variable actions as specified in the appropriate parts of EN 1991
-Access for cleaning and maintenance
-A uniformly distributed load due to snow over the complete roof area The value of this load will depend on the buildingÅfs location
-Asymmetric snow load and loading due to snow drifts
-Wind loading due to pressure and suction
Care must be taken on site to avoid excessive local deflection Typical deflection limits imposed on the cladding are depend on the loading regime considered the location of the structural component and whether a brittle material is present Deflection limits may be specifies by National regulation
Main uses
Metal profile sheets due to their versatility mechanical and design properties can be used as roof and roof cladding as external walls and wall cladding and also as floors They are used in industry and in residential sector and the two sectors can be used in both new construction and rehabilitation Some of the applications where metal profile sheets are used are

Lincoln Village Columbus Ohio

Lincoln Village is a neighborhood located on the West Side of Columbus Ohio and is known for its long history and historical impacts it has had on the surrounding communities Most of the residential real estate is occupied by a mixture of owners and renters Residents in this area tend to be older and well committed to this area Homes were typically built between 1940 and 1969 while many other were also built between 1970 and 1999 Those who built and live in these homes contain a unique mix of cultural or occupational groups
Lincoln Village was founded in 1955 as a planned community by a real estate subsidiary of Nationwide Insurance The community was developed to have all the essentials such as a shopping center schools and parks and to incorporate safety considerations such as not positioning the homes on street corners to eliminate blind intersections
History
In 1953 an area located two miles west of Columbus began the lengthy construction process on 1,170 acres of Ohio farmland This village planned to house around 10,000 residents The estimated cost of Lincoln Village was $30 million which included nine miles of streets curbs sewers a million-gallon water tank and the employment of construction crews At this point in time Lincoln Village was expected to have enormous success because it was being built around a 20-acre civic center which included a school library churches playground and wooded park With the addition of apartment buildings single family homes and a shopping center Lincoln Village hoped to be the model community for future developments across the country Murray Lincoln millionaire entrepreneur established Peoples Development Company in 1947 to build housing in Bellevue Ohio Not long after Lincoln started Peoples Mortgage Company for the sole purpose of financing Lincoln Village
Murray Lincoln Ohio Farm Bureau
Born in 1892 Murray Lincoln grew up on a small farm in Massachusetts In 1914 he graduated from what today is the University of Massachusetts with a bachelor of science degree After helping form the first milk distribution cooperative in New England and becoming an agricultural representative for the Plymouth County Trust Company he was recruited to Cleveland and worked for the Society for Savings in 1917
In 1919 Lincoln was approached by farmers who wanted to entertain the idea of forming a cooperative From this meeting he became inspired and a year later the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation was founded As Executive Secretary the bureau and Lincoln experienced tremendous success by increasing state wide membership marketing goods produced by its members and establishing co-op stores where farmers bought millions worth of lower priced goods
Auto Insurance
Due to a large number of bureau members complaining about the high cost of vehicle insurance Lincoln and staff member Ezra Anstaett began exploring the idea of providing auto insurance to its members Eventually the bureau did team up with State Farm Insurance but the contract was turned down by the governor and insurance superintendent In order to provide auto insurance they were advised to start their own agency
Farm Bureau Mutual - Nationwide
In 1926 the Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Insurance Company was formed now known as Nationwide At first insurance was only offered within the state but like any successful national business they expanded and began providing numerous lines of insurance to other states and non-farmers In 1947 regulators believed it was best that the Ohio Farm Bureau and Farm Bureau Mutual split because of overlapping leadership Lincoln would eventually retire from the Ohio Farm Bureau but remain with Farm Bureau Mutual In 1955 Farm Bureau Mutual was officially changed to Nationwide Lincoln would later retire in 1962 and die four years later in 1966
Structures and Landmarks
Westland Mall
Opening in 1969 Westland Mall was one of four open-air shopping centers in the Columbus area The original stores that opened at Westland were JC Penney Sears and most popular Lazarus The Lazarus store was originally free standing in 1962 Sears and JC Penney were built along with the mall in 1967-1969 Around this time Lazarus expanded not long after in 1982 the mall was enclosed
Economic Hardship
At one point in time Westland Mall was the main attraction for people surrounding the Columbus area It offered everything that shoppers could ask for The only problem was that newer and better developments were being built nearby which would eventually attract customers to different parts of the city There were three developments that ultimately caused Westland Mall so become a not so desirable option Columbus City Center The Mall at Tuttle Crossing and Easton Town Center These malls were simply just better and more modern which shoppers found very appealing
Economic Development
According to NBC news Westland Mall plans to make a comeback in the near future The City of Columbus has been working with the casino developer Penn National The new Western Town Center will replace the old Westland Mall and be very similar to Easton Town Center It will include nearly everything that the popular east side attraction offers except new residential properties Many locals are looking forward to this enhancement It will bring in large amounts of tax money and create many new jobs

T?ebo? Altarpiece

The T?ebo? Altarpiece or the Wittingau Altarpiece is a dismantled retable altarpiece commissioned for the Augustinian Canons church of St Aegidius Trebon completed c 1380-1390 It was executed by the unidentified Bohemian painter known by the notname Master of Wittingau one of the most important gothic artists of the courtly international style
The altarpiece depicts events around the death and resurrection of Christ and is considered influenced by the Devotio Moderna religious movement which placed emphasis on meditation and the inner life The T?ebo? Altarpiece is regarded for its intense use of colour and light and its loose brushwork and elegant rhythmical forms
At some point the work was broken up with two surviving panels in the National Gallery Prague and a third in the Alsova Jihoceska Galeria Hluboka Czech Republic The extant panels are the The Agony in the Garden Entombment and the Resurrection The reverse of the Agony shows languid touching rosy-cheeked representations of Saints Catherine Mary Magdalene and Margaret
It is not known how many panels made up the original altarpiece or how they were arranged A total five is considered the most likely number which would allow for four wings and a larger center piece
Description
File:Eichhorn Madonna.jpg|thumb|Master of the Eichhorn Madonna Eichhorn Madonna c 1350 Tempera paint
on wood
It is thought the work consisted of five panels a main now lost crucifixion and two pairs of wings of which three survive The outer panels visible when the wings were folded showed groupings of saints and apostles
Each extant panel is dominated by a single horizontal line in which Christ is centrally positioned Examination of the underdrawings show that the artist frequently deviated from his preliminary sketches an indication of the looseness and freshness of his overall approach The images are flat as they are completed before the advent of perspective They are the more remarkable for the rich and precisely rendered small details and use of glazes given that they were completed before the development of oil painting some 30 years later According to art historian Robert Suckale never before have weapons appeared sharper or shields more spiked The painting is quintessentially Gothic and does not evidence any Italian influence Rather it can be within the tradition of Bohemian painting or possibly Franco-Flemish art Its innovative use of light may be traced to the techniques of the Master Theoderic while the positioning of the knight below Christ in the Resurrection references the Christ child in the c 1350 Italian-Byzantium icon the Eichhorn Madonna
Several of the figures wear heavily folded and sweeping robes or dresses and the work is considered an important precedent to the Faltenstil Fold style popular in 15th Century Bohemian painting and sculpture
It is associated with the Devotio Moderna movement because it was commissioned at a time when the canon's church was undergoing growth and reform It's high altar was consecrated in 1378 and the emperor Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia seems to have played a role in financing these moves Certainly the Master of Wittingau was a leading painter in central Europe at the time and the commissioning of a lavish polyptych would not have been inexpensive
Agony in the Garden
The panel is set in mountain terrain at night with Chris kneeling and in profile He addressed an angel in the upper right corner of the pictorial space To his right side of are three sleeping apostles - saints Saint James John the Evangelist and St Peter At the upper left is knight in armor The colour scheme is composed of browns intense reds most vividly the sky and garments of St John and blues The highly detailed rocky landscape contains stylised trees and smaller elements including the many flowers and birds The panel is overall harmonious and beautiful It contains characteristic undulating lines,for example in the curves of St Peter's robes
Entombment
The Entombment panel shows a scene from the biblical entombment of Christ as his body is lowered into the large stone sarcophagus His body is covered with a transparent shroud his head with a white blood stained scarf His body is rigid showing the effects of rigor mortis To the left of the tomb are the mourners Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus the Three Maries Mary Magdalene Mary of Clopas and Mary mother of Jesus Above them is the dark crouched figure St John the Evangelist
The mourners faces show strong emotions but rather than despair the mood is of grief and quite reflection The attendants clothes are painted with highly saturated colors St John is dressed in scarlet Mary in a blue dress Mary Cleophas in olive and yellow The lower part of the image is built from shades of gray and shows rock and small fragments of a landscape scene
Resurrection
Compared to the somewhat subdued nighttime atmosphere of the Agony in the Garden the colours of the Entombment are vibrant expressive and vivid while the light is richly gradiated The panel shows the risen Christ having just floated out of his still sealed tomb According to Suckale we are shown not the moment of resurrection but the state of of being resurrected The painter presents the events as a true miracle Chris is dressed in a red robe which is formed in curves resembling those of flames Its colour symbolises his shed blood the wounds are still visible on his hands and side He holds a long pole in his left hand which topped with a banner and golden cross Compared to the other figures in the exant panels the resurrected Christ is grand static and two dimensional according to rising from the sarcophagus like a timeless incorporeal apparition Suckdale compares him to the crucified figures in the works of the Master of Vy??i Brod
In the left hand corner is a knight seemingly just rumbled from his sleep looks up in awe at Christ He wears a Coif and is clad in armor covered with a thin red tunic He has a dagger attached to his belt and holds a long sword and shield with a rounded shield boss


Caravan to Midnight radio show

Caravan to Midnight is a subscription video podcast and syndicated radio talk show with new shows every Monday-Thursday Host John B Wells created Caravan to Midnight in late 2012 as a result of the Fukushima reactor meltdowns In December 2012 Caravan to Midnight began with a new show Monday through Thursday every week In October 2014 the show was expanded to five days a week Also in October 2014 the show became available on both IOS and android platforms CTM hosts a variety of knowledgeable guests every week and the conversation is built upon hard-hitting alternative news stories and opinions about topics and events ranging from conspiracy theories and current events to paranormal world news health and nutrition science politics religion entertainment music and pop culture According to the Caravan to Midnight website the program offers subscriptions to their video broadcasts for $5 a month and individual episodes for ninety-nine cents each
Caravan to Midnight host John B Wells had been a fill-in host for Coast to Coast AM since 2005 until January 2012 when he replaced Ian Punnett as the Saturday evening and second Sunday evening host
Controversy
Controversy surrounded WellsÅf Caravan to Midnight which he began as a paid subscription video podcast in December 2013 while still soaring high in the ratings with Coast to Coast AM WellsÅf ratings on any given Saturday night or weekend on Coast to Coast AM yielded more listeners 1.8 million plus than George NooryÅfs numbers combined 275,000 for the week Wells had stated that he planned to do both shows simultaneously with Caravan to Midnight in the daytime and Coast to Coast AM in the weekend evening Wells formally announced the launch of Caravan to Midnight on January 25 2014 which would debut on February 3 2014 Wells was fired from Coast to Coast AM on January 28 2014 There is much speculation among Coast to Coast AM fans as to the fact that Noory stated Wells left Coast to Coast AM when Wells said he never did and that he was asked to leave
Wells was extremely popular with Coast to Coast AM fans many of whom demanded and posted on Facebook for Wells to take the throne as his numbers on any given night rivaled the showÅfs founder Art Bell who also averaged millions of listeners Many outraged Coast to Coast AM fans and loyal Wells supporters followed Wells over to Caravan to Midnight
On February 7 2014 Bell posted public support and sympathy for the freshly fired Wells with a headline story he published ÅgArt Bell Tolls For WellsÅh on his official website and his official Facebook page Bell cited similar problems he experienced when dealing with the ego of a jealous Noory
Affiliates
It was announced on November 13 2014 that Caravan to Midnight has affiliated with Boston's WRKO-AM/Boston with Wells resuming his former weekend time slot


Vergara v California

In May 2012 lawyers for nine public school students filed the lawsuit of Vergara v California in California state court The suit alleged that several California statutes violated the California Constitution by retaining some grossly ineffective teachers and thus denying equal protection to students assigned to these teachers Further according to the complaint these statutes had disparate impact on poor and minority students who were more likely to be assigned to a grossly ineffective teacher In June 2014 after a two-month trial Judge Rolf M Treu of the California Superior Court issued a preliminary ruling finding that all of the statutes challenged by the plaintiff students were unconstitutional In August 2014 this ruling was finalized The decision was subsequently appealed by Governor Jerry Brown
The challenged statutes
The lawsuit identified five separate statutes that kept ineffective teachers in the classroom The argument by the plaintiffs in the lawsuit was that tenure decisions had to be made too quickly and that once tenure was granted it was too difficult to remove a teacher if a mistake had been made in granting tenure The presence of ineffective teachers necessarily meant that some students were denied their constitutional right to a good education The defendants argued that it was possible to remove bad teachers and that these laws did not cause bad teachers to be in the schools
Tenure permanent employment statute
Before being struck down in the Vergara case certain provisions of the California Education Code conferred permanent employment status or tenure on any teacher who had not been informed that his or her teaching contract had been cancelled by March of the second year of teaching Permanent status required school districts to follow specific evidentiary and procedural requirements before firing a teacher Lawyers for teacher's unions in Vergara argued that this was not equivalent to lifetime employment but instead just recognition of the due process requirements that would have to be satisfied if teachers were to be fired for any one of a number of specified reasons
Firing dismissal statutes
A series of three statutes in California specified a series of procedural requirements that had to be satisfied if a tenured teacher was to be dismissed or fired These requirements the plaintiffs argued put undue cost on districts if they wished to remove a teacher They were also considerably beyond the normal due process rights for other civil servants in California John Deasy Superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD testified that the statutes harmed students
LIFO layoff statute
The final challenged statute told district administrators how to prioritize which teachers would be laid off if they were to reduce the size of their teaching staff The California law required strict use of reverse seniority rules i.e last in first out or LIFO With a few exceptions before any tenured teacher could be laid off the district had to remove all of the more junior nontenured teachers It was impermissible to use information about teacher effectiveness in making layoff decisions
The decision the tenure firing and layoff statutes shock the conscience
On June 10 2014 the court ruled that the statutes at issue produced disparities that shock the conscience and violate the equal protection clause of the California Constitution
As background the court began the Vergara opinion with a discussion of the U.S Supreme Court case of Brown v Board of Education 1954 and the California Supreme Court cases of Serrano v Priest I 1971 Serrano v Priest II 1976 and Butt v State of California 1992 While these cases addressed the issue of a lack of equality of educational opportunity here this Court is directly faced with issues that compel it to apply these constitutional principles to the quality of the educational experience
The court examined the challenged California statutes under strict scrutiny judicial review
Evidence regarding teacher effectiveness
School administrators asked the judge to review a copy of California Standards for the Teaching Profession 2009 Edition as evidence The court pointed out that the opening sentence of those Standards state A growing body of research confirms that the quality of teaching is what matters most for the students development and learning in schools Emphasis added by the court
Based on a 4 year study Dr testified that students in LAUSD who are taught by a teacher in the bottom 5% of competence lose 9.54 months of learning in a single year compared to students with average teachers
Dr an expert called by school administrators testified that 1 - 3% of teachers in California are grossly ineffective Given that the evidence showed roughly 275,000 active teachers in this state the extrapolated number of grossly ineffective teachers ranges from 2,750 to 8,250
A tenure period of less than two years was insufficient
The court found that California's tenure period was actually less than the two year period ostensibly outlined in the statute This was because a tenure decision had to be made in March before the end of a new teacher's second school year In contrast the credentialing induction period for new teachers lasted two full school years Thus a teacher reelected tenure in March may not be recommended for credentialing after the close of the induction program in May leaving the applicable district with a non-credentialed teacher with tenure
There was extensive evidence presented including some from administrators that the tenure statute did not provide nearly enough time for an informed decision to be made regarding the decision of tenure critical for both students and teachers
Jesse Rothstein and David Berliner were experts who testified for the defendant school officials during the trial Both stated that two years was not the optimal amount of time needed to make a tenure decision Three years to five years was instead suggested as a better time frame to make the tenure decision for the mutual benefit of students and teachers
Surveying tenure periods in other U.S states the court found that as of the trial January 27 to March 27 2014 4 states had no tenure system at all 9 states had tenure periods of four to five years 32 had a three year period and 5 including California had a period of two years or less
Firing a teacher in California was too expensive and time consuming
Lawyers for the plaintiff school students alleged that it was too time consuming and too expensive to go through the dismissal process as required by the Dismissal Statutes to rid school districts of grossly ineffective teachers The court agreed concluding that such time and cost constraints cause districts in many cases to be very reluctant to even commence dismissal procedures
The court noted that school administrators and teachers unions had raised the entirely legitimate issue of protecting a teacher's due process rights when she or he was faced with the possibility of being fired However the court decided that given the evidence the Dismissal Statutes present the issue of uber due process
This Court is confident that the independent judiciary of this state is no less dedicated to the protection of reasonable due process rights of teachers than it is of protecting the rights of children to constitutionally mandated equal education opportunities
Teacher layoffs prioritized solely by seniority harm students
California's LIFO-only layoff statute required the last-hired teacher be the statutorily-mandated first-fired one when lay-offs occur
The statute did not contain an exception or waiver based on teacher effectiveness
No matter how gifted the junior teacher and no matter how grossly ineffective the senior teacher the junior gifted one is separated from students and a senior grossly ineffective one is left in place
The logic of statutory scheme is unfathomable and therefore constitutionally unsupportable
Surveying layoff rules for teachers in other U.S jurisdictions the court found that as of the trial January 27 to March 27 2014 2 states provided that seniority could not be considered 18 states and the District of Columbia left the layoff criteria to school district discretion 20 states provided that seniority could be considered among other factors and 10 states including California provided that seniority was the sole factor or one that had to be considered
Litigants
Funding for the plaintiff school students was provided by David Welch a Silicon Valley entrepreneur The school students were represented by the Gibson Dunn law firm The defense for school administrators was provided by the California Attorney General The California Teachers Association intervened on the side of the defense and was represented by Altschuler Berzon
Plaintiff experts
The plaintiff school students experts included a group of economists who examined various aspects of teacher effectiveness under value-added modeling The original complaint was built on the analyses of teacher effectiveness and the estimated economic cost of ineffective teachers by Eric Hanushek of Stanford University Raj Chetty Harvard University and Thomas Kane Harvard University testified on the distribution of ineffective teachers in California and particularly in Los Angeles Dan Goldhaber University of Washington testified on the impact of LIFO layoff statutes Plaintiff rebuttal testimony was provided by Eric Hanushek and by Dr Anthony Smith former superintendent of the Oakland Unified School District
Defense experts
Linda Darling Hammond Stanford University David Berliner Arizona State University and Susan Moore Johnson Harvard University testified on their understanding of the problems of tenure and of the impact of ineffective teachers Jesse Rothstein of the University of California at Berkeley testified that tenure restrictions served the interest of student achievement
Implications
The day after the Vergara decision was announced the Associated Press described it in a USA Today article as a landmark decision that could influence the gathering debate over tenure across the country
In reaction to this ruling a similar lawsuit was filed in New York State
The court's ruling found the statutes to be unconstitutional but did not specify what should be done The California legislature is responsible for devising any alternative statutes

Modern Slavery Bill 2014?15

The Modern Slavery Bill 2014?15 is a United Kingdom Government Bill designed to tackle slavery in the UK which consolidates the current offences relating to trafficking and slavery The bill extends to England and Wales and is expected to become law before the next UK general election in 2015 It was published in draft form in October 2013 by James Brokenshire Parliamentary Under Secretary for Crime and Security The bill's sponsors in the Home Office are Theresa May and Lord Bates
James Brokenshire was quoted as saying that the bill will send the strongest possible message to criminals that if you are involved in this disgusting trade in human beings you will be arrested you will be prosecuted and you will be locked up
Proposals
The bill contains a number of proposals
Amendments
The draft bill included no measures to counter the use of slave labour abroad as the Home Office believed that asking businesses to audit and report on modern slavery in their supply chains would be an Ågadditional burdenÅh However campaigning resulted in a supply chain clause being added to the bills so that Ågbig business will be forced to make public its efforts to stop the use of slave labour by its suppliersÅh
In November 2014 Fiona Mactaggart MP added an amendment to the bill concerning prostitution aimed at criminalising the purchase of sex In the bill's debate in the House House of Commons John McDonnell MP argued against the amendment He highlighted the lack of evidence for any correlation between the Swedish sex purchase ban and a reduction in numbers of sex workers or their clients and cited findings that not only do such measures not work they actually cause harm McDonnell quoted Reverend Andrew Dotchin a founding member of the Safety First Coalition ÅgI strongly oppose clauses on prostitution in the Modern Slavery Bill which would make the purchase of sex illegal Criminalising clients does not stop prostitution nor does it stop the criminalisation of women It drives prostitution further underground making it more dangerous and stigmatising for women.Åh The amendment was subsequently dropped
Criticism
Experts in the issue are sceptical of the bill believing that it has many shortcomings Parosha Chandran a human rights barrister and United Nations expert on trafficking claims that the bill is very poor on victim protection Anthony Steen who advised on the legislation and chairs the Human Trafficking Foundation claims that the bill fails to focus on the needs of victims of trafficking in the UK ÅgThe bill is wholly and exclusively about law enforcement ? but it shouldnÅft be enforcement-based it should be victim-based he said
Human rights group Liberty has argued that the bill should

Itamar Shimoni

Itamar Shimoni born in 1968 is an Israeli politician and current mayor of Ashkelon Israel
Early life and education
Shimoni has a B.A in Business Administration Engineering in Industrial Management
Career
He has served as CEO of Atarim Creative Manager at Teva and CEO of Dasco one of Israel's largest furniture manufacturing companies
Political career
In October 2013 Shimoni became mayor of Ashkelon when he defeated the incumbent Benny Vaknin who had served four terms He quickly declared was on organized crime in the city and ordered the bulldozing of a restaurant owned by crime boss Shalom Domrani's family In November 2013 he removed children from Ashkelon schools who had been exposed to radiation and arranged for them to enter schools elsewhere
In November 2014 Shimoni unleashed a firestorm of criticism for announcing that he would not allow Arab workers to continue construction on shelters for Ashkelon's children He said that his directive was in response to an attack at a Jerusalem synagogue earlier in the week where two Palestinians from East Jerusalem killed four Jews and a Druze policeman although unlike the perpetrators of the attack the Arab workers in Ashkelon are Israeli citizens His remarks drew immediate reaction from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and MK's who called the employment discrimination racist and illegal Economy Minister Naftali Bennett announced he would work to overturn Shimoni's directive Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein warned Shimoni against implementing his discriminatory plan saying it would have serious legal ramifications Nevertheless a poll by Channel 10 showed that 58% of Israelis support the discriminatory practice 32% did not approve and 10% did not know The only exceptions to the near universal condemnation of Shimoni's plan in the political arena were Housing Minister Uri Ariel and Likud MK Moshe Feiglin It was reported that the police force in Ashkelon is not acting on the mayor's directive and instead according to a senior officer will obey the law The equal employment commissioner in the Economy Ministry Tziona Koenig-Yair observed a jump in employment claims by Arabs who say they are suffering unemployment on racial grounds and she threatened to battle the Ashkelon mayor in court if that is necessary to reverse his decision
On the Sunday following his controversial remarks Shimoni backtracked on his decision He said that he was trying to address concerns of parents but would now allow construction to continue with children moved to a different venue until completion He added that at no time did he order Arabs to leave Ashkelon Shimoni was apparently not alone among Israeli mayors in ordering discriminatory practices against Arabs following the attack in Jerusalem Yehiel Lasri mayor of nearby Ashod allegedly targeted Arab workers for extra security checks
Personal
Shimoni is the father of three children

Triticum compactum

Triticum compactum is a species of club wheat T compactum is a hexaploid with 21 chromosomes T compactum is similar to common wheat however it has a more compact ear due to shorter rachis segments It is so similar to common wheat that it is often considered a subspecies of T aestivum Nearly all T compactum is grown in the Pacific Northwest T compactum like other club wheats has been selectively bred for its lower protein content Due to the process of selective breeding T compactum has fewer HMW-glutenin genes than other species of wheat Flour made from T compactum is thus better suited for the production of cookies T compactum like other bread wheats have never been observed to grow in the wild
History
Europe and the Middle east
The oldest primitive forms of T compactum appear to have first arisen along with similar wheats in neolithic Syria From Syria T compactum spread to Europe and was considered to be the oldest wheat species cultivated in Europe until the 1940's when older tertraploid varieties of wheat were identified T compactum appears in Europe for the first time during the Neolithic Era reaching as far as Spain by 4600 BC Evidence of T compactum in Portugal and France demonstrates that the Romans cultivated T compactum on the Iberian peninsula during the first and second centuries BCE Evidence of T compactum found along with barley in a east Finnish settlement reveals that T compactum was cultivated in Finland starting between fifth and seventh centuries AD
North America
T compactum was believed to have been introduced to North America for Chile by pacific shipping routes during the 1960's and 70's However analysis of adobe bricks in San Antonio San Fernando Soledad San Jose San Juan Bautista and Sonoma missions revealed that T compactum was present in California by the year 1787 and was likely introduced by Spaniards through Mexico."T compactum was farmed extensively during the beginning of California's agricultural history Data even suggests that T compactum was farmed more than the related T aestivum during this time T compactum erinaceum also called California Club Wheat,was a bearded hairy rachis red-chaffed subspecies of T compactum that is thought to have disappeared before 1822 As production of American wheat drastically increased during the early twentieth century T aestivum rose in popularity surpassing T compactum Today most T compactum is grown along side T aestivum because of their similar nature
Identification
Unfossilized Specimen
T compactum is small free-threshing club wheat with rounded grains In T compactum like other bread and club wheats there is a keel on the upper section of the otherwise flat glume."T compactum characteristically has a smaller crooked crease than other species of wheat and smaller cheek size at the brush end T compactum is identifiable from T aestivum mainly by its shorter rachis segments and compact ear for which it is named The now extinct subspecies of T compactum T compactum erinaceum or California club wheat can be distinguished from other subspecies by its red chaff and hairier rachides The below chart indicates the physiological factors that can be used to distinguish between various subspecies and varieties of T compactum
Fossilized Specimen
Most ancient T compactum was cultivated between the Neolithic era and the Bronze age and thus the most common evidence of ancient T compactum is carbonized Although carbonized wheat may often resemble it unfossilized counterpart and can often be identified with the same methods describe above it is sometimes difficult to distinguish carbonized wheat this way due to a damaged or incomplete specimen As a general rule if a naked wheat wheat with round grains and irregularly broken rachis forming internodes is uncovered in a European site excluding all sites on the Italian or Balkan peninsulas it should be considered a hexaploid club wheat either T aestivum or T compactum If such wheat has short internodes it should be identified as T compactum
Agronomy
Triticum compactum generally flowers during the months of June and July with its seeds ripening in August and September Triticum compactum is an annual plant growing to heights of approximately 6 meters in the summer and dying in the winter


Janos Nagy Balogh

Janos Nagy Balogh 2 August 1874 Budapest - 22 November 1919 Budapest was a Hungarian painter and graphic artist who specialized in proletarian subjects
Biography
He came from a humble working-class family His father died early and his mother had to support the family doing laundry so he spent much of his youth in poverty Later he was apprenticed to a Master Painter whose drunken abusive behavior made him seek a way to escape so he began saving his money with the goal of becoming an artist
Originally he enrolled at the School of Fine and Applied Arts where he attended night classes while supporting himself by house-painting In 1899 he was able to spend a few months in Munich attending classes taught by Ludwig von Herterich at the Academy of Fine Arts but his financial necessities continued to prevent him from attending daytime classes so he ended up being essentially self-taught and able to paint only in his spare time
At first he developed his style by painting still lifes self-portraits and portraits of his mother engaged in household chores Then perhaps under the influence of Jean-Francois Millet he decided to focus on painting the workers he knew so well from his youth For many years he remained reluctant to show his works in public or part with them What little money he earned from working went mostly to painting supplies He eventually became a local character who was readily recognizable by the very old floppy hat he always wore
In 1915 he joined the Army and received a wound that resulted in his right arm being paralyzed but he continued to work as best he could with his left hand One day his neighbors heard a loud crash and rushed to his apartment where they found him lying on his back clutching his brush He was taken to the hospital but died shortly after arriving there His friend the art critic and writer Jen? Balint 1889-1945 arranged for a quick private and apparently somewhat secret burial at the New Public Cemetery Within ten years his neglected grave had disappeared
Due to the political unrest at the time his first exhibition wasn't staged until 1922 at the Museum of Fine Arts After 1945 when the Communist government took power and social realism in the arts was being promoted his paintings gained official approbation In 1959 on the anniversary of his death a major exhibition was held at the Hungarian National Gallery A commemorative stamp with one of his self-portraits was issued in 1969 and a statue in his honor showing him in his trademark hat by Istvan Martsa was created in 1975 and placed in Kos Karoly Park

Chicago City Council
In 1983 Garcia was the campaign manager for labor organizer Rudy Lozano who challenged longtime alderman Frank Stemberk of the 22nd Ward In the February 1983 election Lozano came 17 votes short of forcing a runoff which his supporters contended was due to voters with Spanish surnames being purged from the rolls denying him the votes to force a runoff Lozano was murdered in June 1983 shot to death in his home A reputed gang member was convicted for Lozano's murder but his supporters still content that he was assassinated for his labor and political activities
In 1984 Garcia challenged Stemberk for his place as a Committeeman in the Cook County Democratic Party Supporters of Lozano rallied around him and he received the endorsement of Mayor Harold Washington Stemberk was a supporter of alderman Edward Vrdolyak of the 10th ward who controlled the City Council and opposed Washington's administration This divide within city government was dubbed the Council Wars by the Chicago media With Lozano supporters taking to the race with a religious fervour and Washington campaigning heavily on Garcia's behalf he defeated Stemberk by 2,811 votes 40.62% to 2,752 39.77% with activist and former labor union leader August Sallas taking 1,357 19.61% Unlike other committeemen and women Garcia used his office to provide constituent services which helped him maintain his high profile Garcia was also appointed Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Water by Washington a post he held from 1984 to 1986
Meanwhile Washington's allies had sued the city in federal court claiming that the ward map drawn up after the 1980 Census had unfairly dispersed black and Hispanic voters At that time whites were about 40% of the city's population blacks were also about 40% and Hispanics were about 15% but there were 33 white aldermen only 16 blacks and just 1 Hispanic In December 1985 as a result of a November 1985 ward remap judge Charles Ronald Norgle Sr of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ordered a special election for March 18 1986 in seven wards including the 22nd The special elections gave Washington the opportunity to wrest control of the city council from Vrdolyak Stemberk chose not to run for re-election and Garcia declared his candidacy In the nonpartisan election Garcia faced supermarket owner and Stemberk ally Guadalupe Martinez and beauty supply store owner Fred Yanez Yanez emphasised his military service and Martinez called Garcia 100 percent Communist and criticised him for selling garbage cans which Martinez gave away for free The result was not close Garcia winning by 3,293 votes 54.58% to Martinez 2,013 33.37% and Yanez 727 12.05% carrying 26 of the 27 precincts Garcia was also re-elected Committeeman with 53.98% of the vote carrying 24 of the 27 precincts His election and the victory of two other Washington supporters meant that Vrdolyak's supporters had a one-seat majority Six weeks later Washington ally Luis Gutierrez won a runoff in the 26th Ward and the council was thus evenly split between Washington and Vrdolyak supporters Washington had the ability to cast tie-breaking votes Vrdolyak was stripped of his powers and the Council Wars ended
Garcia was re-elected with 3,998 votes 53.59% in 1987 and with 2,707 votes 52.36% in 1991 On the council he served on the Budget and Government Operations Committees Rules Municipal Code Revision and Ethics Economic Development Education Finance License Ports Wharves and Bridges Streets and Alleys Traffic Control and Safety committees and Chaired the Aviation committee
Illinois Senate
In 1992 Garcia ran for the Illinois Senate winning the Democratic primary with 8,604 votes 52.06% to Donald C Smith's 6,159 37.26% and Gilbert G Jimenez 1,765 10.68% The primary was tantamount to election in the heavily Democratic 1st District and in the general election he defeated Republican nominee Esequiel Zeke Iracheta by 21,314 votes 81.74% to 4,762 18.26% He succeeded Democratic State Senator Howard W Howie Carroll who was redistricted to the 8th District and became the first State Senator of Mexican descent Garcia resigned from the city council and was succeed by his protege Ricardo Munoz
In the 1996 Democratic primary he was challenged by Alderman Juan Soliz of the 25th Ward Soliz who had also been elected in the March 1986 special elections had been supported by Vrdolyak earning him the ire of Chicago Hispanics When Soliz was elected he called for unity among Hispanic aldermen a plea which they ignored Soliz and Garcia even celebrated their inaugurations by hiring separate Mariachi bands to play outside the council chambers After Soliz was replaced as Chairman of the Aviation Committee by Garcia he derided it as a racist move though they were both Mexican-Americans Garcia defeated Soliz by 6,839 votes 59.34% to 4,686 40.66% Garcia was re-elected unopposed in the general election
In office Garcia helped shepherd immigrant-friendly health care and education reforms through the legislature
Garcia was defeated in the 1998 Democratic primary election by Antonio Munoz who was backed by the Hispanic Democratic Organization Mayor Richard M Daley's campaign group and political machine Munoz defeated Garcia by 6,924 votes 53.72% to 5,964 46.28% Alderman Ricardo Munoz no relation to Antonio Munoz talking in 2010 about his mentor's defeat said Part of the rationale that I think Chuy lost in 98 was that we got sloppy and they and the HDO got lucky It rained all day and we didn't have raincoats for our guys until 11 o'clock By that time they were frozen stiff So we lost the field game
Political interregnum
After his defeat Garcia left office in January 1999 and became Executive Director of the Little Village Community Development Corporation In June 2005 he helped found the Latino Action Research Network a PAC to help better represent the city's Latino population
Cook County Board of Commissioners
In 2010 Garcia ran for the Cook County Board of Commissioners challenging 7th District member and HDO candidate Joseph Mario Moreno in the Democratic primary Garcia defeated him by 9,602 votes 54.74% to 7,939 45.26% In the general election he faced Green Party nominee Paloma M Andrade and defeated her by 24,612 votes 86.29% to 3,912 13.72%
Garcia was re-elected unopposed to a second term on the Board of Commissioners in the 2014 elections
2015 mayoral election
Garcia is currently running for Mayor of the City of Chicago and is the most formidable progressive challenge to Mayor Rahm Emanuel

Culture Clash 2012
In 2012 the event was held at Wembley Arena on the 7th November and fought between Boy Better Know bringing Grime to the scene Channel One the reigning champions who brought Reggae & Dancehall into the mix Annie Mac Presents AMP Major Lazer and was hosted by Tim Westwood on the mic
In short a chance for each team to get the crowd on their side without fear of defeat ? the clash doesnÅft officially start until Round Two Channel One bubbled Annie Mac presents took it in turns to each play short pre-planned/pre-recorded sets featuring 2012Åfs biggest dance tunes Boy Better Know hyped over low-quality mp3s and Major Lazer played ÅeGangnam StyleÅf while Diplo crowd-surfed in a Zorb Everyone remained firmly in first gear with Annie Mac Presents probably the standout
15 minutes of music no special guests and no custom dubplates as rules stated that both must be held back until round four This was broken twice once by Annie MacÅfs team when Sam Smith came on to perform ÅeLatchÅf with Disclosure and then a second time when Major Lazer brought out Stylo G for a ferociously-received rendition of ÅeCall Me a YardieÅf In truth the former set was fairly pedestrian Major Lazer who won the round were comfortably ahead of the others in terms of timing and precision ? the selection was a little too obvious at times dropping House of PainÅfs ÅeJump AroundÅf immediately after claiming youÅfre not here to play overplayed tunes was a low point but overall it was impressive
Boy Better Know had already come out complaining that Major Lazer had broken the rules by bringing out the custom dubs in round one and like an angered lion with about fifteen heads and one astonishingly ripped body who was that guy ? anyone Skepta and co turned up the heat over low-end classics like ÅeDuppyÅf BreakageÅfs ÅeHardÅf instrumental and ÅeR U Really From the EndsÅf though the biggest reactions came from Wiley ? both when he dropped his classic Åggetting Åeem hyperÅh bars and in a pleasant surprise when he closed the set on recent hits ÅeHeatwaveÅf and ÅeIÅfm SkankingÅf
Channel One meanwhile gave Major Lazer a bit of a talking to dissed ÅgSgt PokeyheadÅh and ÅgSkream and BhangraÅh we think thatÅfs what they said anyway referred to Annie Mac as looking like a lost sheep and then bubbled Brilliantly in a stadium full of laptops light shows and CDJs Channel One DJ Jah T had two turntables in front of him all night and only ever needed to use one of them Respect
At this point the rules had gone out the window The premise of Round Three was that each stage plays the music of another sound thus beating a rival at their own game Channel One didnÅft really change a thing bar bringing a younger MC on stage as a loose throw-down to Boy Better Know while Major Lazer one-upped Channel One with an excellent showcase of foundation reggae and ska that included a performance by ÅeBuddy ByeÅf singer Johnny Osbourne ThatÅfs right ? another secret guest before Round Four and it put BBK into a stinker of a mood The lions got angrier turning on Ms Dynamite for being on the Annie Mac stage instead of theirs and throwing the ultimate underhand serve at Major Lazer by revealing that Diplo had Usher ready to bring out in Round Four to perform ÅeClimaxÅf They then played it themselves to save everyone the trouble
The undoubted winner of Round Three however was Annie Mac Presents In truth AMP was completely losing the crowd mid-way through the round Maverick Sabre covered ÅeWonderwallÅf ? that really is all you need to know until a demolition job on Diplo saved their day First they aired the producerÅfs infamous Blackberry advert on the big screen with the phone replaced by a pink dildo and a text message from Skrillex reading ÅeWhoÅfs this How did you get my number?Åf superimposed onto its screen And then even better a team of camp chubby male dancers in golden hot pants came on to ape DiploÅfs ÅeExpress YourselfÅf routine complete with an edit of ÅePon de FloorÅf that dropped into the Benny Hill theme tune
A deserved winner to the round thenÅc that is until Westwood announced that the results of both Round Two and Three were void due to cheating The score went back to zero for both Major Lazer and Annie Mac and Round Four was to be the decider
The deciding round of the Culture Clash was ultimately one of missed opportunities Channel One brought out roots reggae singer Luciano and continued to do what theyÅfd done all competition very well and with great dignity It was obvious at this point however that there would be no repeat of the past Culture Clash at LondonÅfs Roundhouse where they took home the crown partially as a result of Skream & Benga and Metalheadz trying to turn the event into a one-on-one competition
Annie Mac Presents went for quantity over quality in terms of the secret guests and ultimately paid for it Baby Sol and Lottie Tricity performed RedlightÅfs ÅeLost in Your LoveÅf Ms Dynamite returned for ÅeWile OutÅf and Katy B ? to the biggest cheer of AMPÅfs Round Four ? hit the stage for ÅeOn a MissionÅf But by the time Example had played and Rudimental collaborator John Newman spilt onto the stage in a suit so ill-fitting youÅfd swear you were back in sixth form the whole thing had turned into a one-trick clusterfuck that could have been done a lot better
Boy Better Know produced comfortably their best round of the competition after an appearance by Chipmunk that could have been jarring but resulted in a pleasant surprise they unloaded a series of vicious war dubs that included BBK re-versions of ÅeHard in the PaintÅf and ÅeI DonÅft LikeÅf and an special of GiggsÅf ÅeTalkinÅf da ÅeArdestÅf ? the latter getting the biggest reaction for GiggsÅf reference to Skream and BengaÅfs coke habits The climax though and the moment that BBK fans had clearly been waiting for was wheeling out Lethal B first for ÅeLeave It YeahÅf with Arsenal reserve-turned-celebrity wrecking ball Emmanuel Frimpong joining him on stage and then for ÅePowÅf
Major Lazer went on last and despite clearly thinking that they had it in the bag ? a view shared it seemed by the majority of the crowd ? produced their weakest showing since Round One A solid start a war dub from Pharaoh Monch over ÅeSimon SaysÅf was completely negated by ÅeSmells Like Teen SpiritÅf and ÅeSong 2Åf WTF and although the Diplo phonebook was in full effect bringing out an incredible-looking Rita Ora as well as Usher neither performer was actually much cop After fumbling a response to BBKÅfs outing him in Round Three Usher half-sung his way through the original version of ÅeClimaxÅf before performing it again over the ÅeStaleg RiddimÅf and weÅfre not sure anyone could even hear Ora ? though that might be due to the bass which was at a throat-shuddering high on the Major Lazer stage at this point
The winners of Culture Clash 2012 was Boy Better Know
Culture Clash 2014
In 2014 the event was held at Earls Court Exhibition Centre on the 30th October and fought between Boy Better Know the reigning champions bringing Grime to the scene Stone Love Movement who brought Reggae & Dancehall into the mix Rebel Sound a one-off crew made up of Chase & Status MC Rage David Rodigan and Shy FX who brought Drum & Bass and Jungle to the table ASAP Mob who brought Rap music into the arena and was hosted by Annie Mac and Doc Brown on the mic
BBK open proceedings gunning for war It was like an ultimate grime version of ÅeStars On 45Åå ? JME batters out Åe96 F**kriesÅf Frisco and Solo 45 trade bars Skepta runs out for ÅeThatÅfs Not MeÅf with JME and the pair of them get the first serious noise of the night ? only surpassed by the sudden appearance of Wiley Jammer does ÅeMurkle ManÅf dressed as well the Murkle Man and in a dizzying climax they drive the Void system to its limits with ÅeToo Many ManÅf and ÅeShakeyÅf
Stone Love struggle to return fire despite being musically strong too ? Damien MarleyÅfs ÅeWelcome To JamrockÅf gets the inevitable forward as does Sister NancyÅfs ÅeBam BamÅf and they throw cross-genre curveballs with the likes of Lethal BÅfs ÅePowÅf and A$AP FergÅfs own ÅeShabba RanksÅf ? but Rebel Sound put up more of a fight First Rodigan cackles as Trevor McDonald appears in a faux-TV report to cuss the opposition then the teamÅfs DJs rain down a barricade of jungle favourites old and new ? from Roni Size to Chase and Status Their system was by far the clearest and heaviest sounding and the pace of selections and smooth mixing seems to be winning the crowd over
A$AP Mob end the round on a lethargic tip playing through favourites like ÅeMultiplyÅf and ÅeWorkÅf Clearly the concept of ÅgclashÅh hasnÅft really registeredwith the rap giants On the positive side Rocky does ride a quad bike onto stage and a backstage rumour suggests heÅfs brought loads more gas guzzlers with him but that Chase and Status have nicked the keys
Definitely the Round where David Rodigan and Rebel Sound began to run considerably ahead of the others ? not surprising considering the experience of the man on top Opening with a Sampha dub plate of ÅeToo MuchÅf other highlights of their set include a Max Romeo dub of ÅeChase The DevilÅf and a return-fire remix of Skepta & JMEÅfs ÅeThat Not MeÅf from Round 1 To a chorus of boos cheers and the sound of thousands of pubescent grime fans going Ågcheeeeeeez!Åh Rodigan brings out defector Tempa T who promptly slays everyone with ÅeNext HypeÅf BBK are seriously annoyed ? JME gets their supporters chanting ÅgTempa PRICK Tempa PRICKÅh
A sluggish A$AP Mob muster a good sequence with FlockaÅfs ÅeHard In The PaintÅf Lethal BÅfs ÅePowÅf Chief KeefÅfs ÅeI DonÅft LikeÅf and finally ÅeNiggas In ParisÅf whilst BBK draw for ÅeGhetto KyoteÅf ÅeWoo RiddimÅf and bring out Lethal B himself to do ÅePowÅf proper Stone Love opt for dancehall classics ? Barrington Levy Elephant Man the ubiquitous and highly appropriate ÅeRum & RedbullÅf ? and bring out Stylo G to do ÅeCall Me A YardieÅf
The title of this round was Sleeping With The Enemy the idea being that each crew would use the otherÅfs riddims to send back at them in a musical Mobius loop Sadly BBK put a middle finger up to the rules claiming that they didnÅft like the opposing teamsÅf songs enough to play them Some great pars in this round from the camp namely from Skepta ÅgChase & Status canÅft fight their own battles so they called their uncle and granddadÅh and Jammer ÅgLets not call them Stone Love more like Stone AgeÅh
Rebel Sound bring out the cast of Kurupt FM as an oblique intro to a re-vocal of ÅeWith A Little Bit Of LuckÅf and then reel out dubplates by Pusha T Ghetto Riko and Emile Sande who calls out BBK Ågfuck Jammer fuck SkeptaÅh over ÅePulse XÅf Stone Love have their strongest round musically speaking Rick Ross DMX and Ruff Ryders classics 50 Cent and two versions of Buffalo Soldier but it feels like the pace is too swift and they arenÅft letting the tracks catch the audience reaction properly A$AP keep things simple with Tenor SawÅfs ÅeRing The AlarmÅf Juicy JÅfs ÅeBandz A Make Her DanceÅf and G.O.O.D MusicÅfs ÅeMercyÅf instrumental getting a surging forward
The final round purely dubplates and specials allowed ? this should separate the wheat from the chaff Rodigan is not ramping ? opens by calling A$AP Åga living joke in London tonightÅh and telling Rocky to go live in Atlanta because he canÅft go back to Harlem and then plays a dubplate by Rihanna ÅeWe Found LoveÅf re-versioned to say ÅhRebel Sound killing BBK / Rebel Sound killing A$AP MobÅh etc which stuns the crowd for a few seconds A$AP bring out Danny Brown who finally blows the cobwebs out of their stage with a great rendition of ÅeBlueberry Pills & Cocaine)Åf though he also shows up A$AP MobÅfs own performance
BBKÅfs round peaks with a great rendition of ÅeR U Really Really From The EndzÅf their best effort of the night and a vintage BBK performance in all senses while Stone Love draw for dubs of Jimmy CliffÅfs ÅeThe Harder They ComeÅf and Millie SmallÅfs ÅeMy Boy LollipopÅf which sends a shriek round the arena so high-pitched you can hear windows shattering
The Winners of Culture Clash 2014 were Rebel Sound The last 3 winners of Culture Clash Channel One Boy Better Know & Rebel Sound Have all been put in the Red Corner

Manuel Polo y Peyrolon

Manuel Polo y Peyrolon Canete 1846 ? Valencia 1918 was a Spanish novelist philosopher academic and a Carlist politician
Family and youth
Manuel Polo y Peyrolon was born in Canete a village on the Western slopes of Montes Universales a southern ridge of Sistema Iberico Located in the Castillan province of Cuenca the area bordered the regions of Aragon and Valencia and formed part of what was once known as Alto Maestrazgo He was descendant to a petty bourgeoisie family His father Domingo Polo originated from the Aragonese city of Belchite during the First Carlist War he sided with the legitimists and served as a secretary of general Jose Maria Arevalo y Requeno Following the Carlist defeat he had to abandon his job and settled in Canete practicing as a lawyer ManuelÅfs mother Maria Peyrolon was also Aragonese from Calomarde Following her early death in 1853 Manuel and his younger brother were partially looked after by her sister Concepcion Spending most of his childhood and youth with relatives in Gea de Albarracin he considered himself a turolense
Manuel was brought up in a fervently Catholic ambience politically strongly flavored by Carlism He graduated in filosofia y letras from Universidad Central in Madrid and in derecho civil y canonico from Universidad de Valencia guided by Miguel Vicente Almazan and obtaining later PhD laurels in philosophy Following a brief and temporary episode as profesor auxiliar of metafisica in Valencia in 1868-69 he returned to Aragon and successfully applied to Instituto de Segunda Ensenanza de Teruel where he commenced teaching Psicologia Logica y Etica in 1870 Manuel Polo y Peyrolon has never married and had no children
Novelist
PoloÅfs first literary work Realidad poetica de mis montanas appeared in 1873 Except that it was a collection of short stories instead of a novel it revealed characteristics marking his later works traditional themes simple plot and clear educational purpose with narration set in provincial milieu of Sierra de Albarracin painted with attention to detail and with focus on local customs typical rather for an ethnographical study All these features were developed in PoloÅfs first novel Los Mayos 1878 a rural love story intended as a praise of loyalty and fidelity and considered his best work translated into Italian and German The consecutive ones Sacramento y concubinato 1884 and Quien mal anda ?como acaba 1890 assumed a more militant tone aimed against liberal and secular lifestyles Pacorro 1905 confronted deeds of a young liberal with virtues of a young Carlist cast against the background of a small town undergoing the turbulent period of 1868-1876 The last of Polo's major literary works El guerrillero 1906 revealed more threads of an adventure story set during Third Carlist War it was heavily based on wartime recollections of his brother Florentino PoloÅfs shorter stories remain scaled down versions of his novels
Among his contemporaries Polo was appreciated usually by those sharing similar traditional outlook like Emilia Pardo Bazan and his friends Marcelino Menendez y Pelayo and Jose Maria de Pereda A conservative literary review Ilustracion Catolica identified him as a brilliant follower of Fernan Caballero classified his writings as Ågnovela de familiaÅh and hailed his prose as Ågrestauradora de la novela castellana en los tiempos modernosÅh Noted for authenticity Ågwhich does not disfigure realityÅh his realism was appreciated as an antidote to naturalism ? the trend he consciously opposed - and Ågthe venom of ZolaÅh By favourably disposed contemporaries he was put next to Fernan Caballero de Pereda Francisco Navarro Villoslada Julio Alarcon y Melendez Juan Valera and padre Coloma critics dubbed him Ågmamarracho literarioÅh
Limited popularity of PoloÅfs works hardly outlived their author Even in the early 20th century he was only marginally mentioned by historians of Spanish literature later on he went into oblivion though was occasionally acknowledged in anthologies Today he is missing even in fairly detailed studies written either by Spanish of foreign scholars though mentioned by some dictionaries He is usually situated in-between Romanticism and Realism falling into the costumbrismo or Ågrealismo costumbristaÅh trend also a good representative of Ågnovelas de tesisÅh It is noted that his conventional meager plots can hardly support the weight of nagging moralising objectives especially given repetitive nature of his works On the other hand his novels are appreciated as inexhaustible sources of pefectly captured anecdotes and customs few readers admitting even some charm Apart from realism he is credited for introducing new narrative techniques
Scholar and philosopher
Polo taught Psicologia Logica y Etica in the Teruel college for 9 years Harassed for his pro-Carlist sympathies he decided to leave Aragon Following a successful application and selection process he assumed the same chair in Instituto de Segunda Ensenanza in Valencia in 1879 where he kept teaching until early 20th century Member of Asociacion de Catedraticos Numerarios he was active in a number of Spanish and foreign scholarly institutions His career was crowned in 1908 when he joined Real Academia de la Historia
During his Valencia tenure Polo wrote textbooks for students of philosophy Elementos de psicologia 1879 Elementos de logica 1880 Elementos de Etica 1880 Elementos de Etica o Filosofia Moral 1882 Elementos de Filosofia Moral 1889 Logica elemental 1902 and Etica elemental 1902 in use also in other scholarly centres across the country He did not develop any original philosophical contribution himself apart from works on history and general overviews Polo is known for confronting some trends forming the liberal educational mindset especially krausism and darwinism His stance is classified as neotomismo or neocatolicismo in philosophy and as regeneracionismo politico-educativo in pedagogy
PoloÅfs repudiation of krausism developed in course of the teaching career and stemmed from his growing interest in pedagogy and education in general During last decades of the 19th century krausism became a philosophical powerhouse of liberal Spanish politics represented mostly by Francisco Giner del Rios and Instituto Libre de Ensenanza Its principal intellectual antagonist was Menendez y Pelayo His friend Polo remained rather a proponent and did not construct an own anti-krausian theory though his vehemence gained him the opinion of Åggrande enemigo de la barbarie krausistaÅh especially as Spanish krausism initially avoiding direct confrontation with the Church later assumed a decisively challenging tone Fiercely advocating Catholic integrity as a basis of public education he nevertheless recognized the necessity of incorporating elements from the liberal mainstream some scholars even maintain that Polo was completely integrated in the liberal system of education
Another characteristic feature of PoloÅfs outlook was his position towards evolutionism though opinions on his stance differ Some view it as an exemplary obscurantist Catholic reaction to scientific progress dismissed as Åginvolucionismo integrismo tradicionalismo e ideario reaccionarioÅh Some suggest that his neotomism was not an abrupt rejection of advances produced by science as Polo tried to work out a conciliatory approach Though his stance on darwinism is portrayed as Ågaggressive and intolerant attackÅh others consider it in line with scientific standards of the era systematic and posing questions - like those related to hereditary transmission or variability patterns ? which remained unanswered until the 1920s A detailed study suggests that Polo engaged in the discourse not so much to challenge the evolutionist theory but to confront secularism which used it as a ram against the Spanish Catholic outlook
Politician
Polo commenced his political career in 1870 speaking at local meetings in Sierra de Albarracin During the Third Carlist War he supported the insurgents as an ojalatero placed under police surveillance with most of his property embargoed Facing restrictions and fearing for his life he temporarily went into hiding even following the Carlist defeat in 1876 he was longtime harassed at his workplace in Teruel
In the 1880s he contributed to the legitimist cause mostly as a novelist propagating Carlist virtues of his protagonists and as a catedratico lambasting liberal ideas disseminated by Jews and freemasonry He lost in 1891 and 1893 campaigns to Cortes finally victorious in 1896 In parliament he focused on education opposing Liberal secularisation plans and promoting local languages in schools Following defeats in successive elections he resumed parliamentary career as a senator in 1907 re-elected in 1910 and 1914 In the upper chamber he kept defending the position of Catholic church especially during the Ley del Candado crisis he was sort of acknowledged as dangerous opponent by procedural gimmicks employed by his adversaries Lambasting the others for compromising party line he himself engaged in secret talks with the conservatives
In the 1890s Polo emerged among the Valencian Carlist chieftains He forged friendly relations with marques de Cerralbo and a number of other national leaders gradually becoming a pivotal figure Personally introduced to Carlos VII in 1901 he was considered a candidate for his personal secretary Revealing interest in the emerging workersÅf question he contributed to Acta de Loredan published official Carlist program and persuaded the claimant to re-organise the party uniting military and civil command chain Fully aware of the need to modernise Traditionalism he appreciated the role of efficient party structures building a dense network of circulos
In 1904 Polo was nominated jefe of the Valencian branch Personally intransigent he was resented by other Levantine leaders Manuel Simo Marin and Joaquin Llorens Fernandez The conflict fuelled by strong personalities PoloÅfs adamant leadership style and discrepancies between legitimistas and posibilistas continuously plagued his Valencian tenure Also on the national scene bedeviled by intrigues among Carlist pundits PoloÅfs relations deteriorated including those with Carlos VII and especially his wife Berthe de Rohan He considered his resignation handed to the new Carlist king Jaime III a purely procedural gesture and was shocked to see it accepted though as a senator he was appointed to national executive Junta Nacional Tradicionalista in 1912
With no close family surrounded only by books moths and butterflies personally intolerant and sour up to acrimony by the end of his life Polo grew into a misanthrope and passed into living memory as Åggrumpy old manÅh He became increasingly pessimistic as to the future of Traditionalism highly skeptical of its political leaders and the claimant himself At one point he considered himself close to Integrism though until his death he remained loyal to the Carlist dynasty

Resistance to Federation arrest and death
Totally opposed to the Federation of Nyasaland and Rhodesia he was supposed to be part of the delegation of chiefs to London to oppose its institution But because of poor health his son Willard represented him This delegation met some key figures in London including Reverend Michael Scott at the African Bureau and Cannon Collins of Christian Action
When the Federation was imposed in 1953 Gomani began to pursue resistance by ignoring official agricultural and conservation regulations In response the colonial government suspended and then withdrew its recognition as the paramount chief In May 1953 the police tried to force Gomani out of the district but failed due to the thousands of people that had gathered at his house in Lizwe la Zulu or Lizuli in short
In the midst of the chaos Gomani and heir to his throne Willard together with Reverend Michael Scott escaped into Mozambique where they hid near Villla Courtinho Michael Scott was visiting the chief's court when this happened They were arrested by Mozambican authorities and handed back to the authorities in Malawi Scott was declared a prohibited immigrant and deported

The book which was della Quercia's debut novel was published in 2014 by St Martin's Griffin an imprint of publishing company St Martin's Press The author described the book's genre not as singular distinct genre but as an equal parts cocktail of adventure historical fiction science fiction thriller and comedy
The book has many references to actual events some such as the sinking of the RMS Titanic are important plot points while others such as the destruction of the zeppelin Erbsloh are passively mentioned as news or memories The author also includes excerpts from real newspaper articles which were used to provide exposition in the storyline Similarly all of the main characters in the book were real relevant figures in the 20th century The characters profiles were fictionalized to fit in with the book's plot and atmosphere but their names positions occupations and personalities are kept largely intact
Plot
In 1910 Robert Todd Lincoln an esteemed scientist and the only remaining son of former president Abraham Lincoln is a close personal friend of President William Howard Taft Taft Lincoln and Secret Service Chief John Wilkie are returning to Washington on Taft's secret government zeppelin Airship One Lincoln reveals that he has found his father's pocket watch while going through his files Lincoln explains that he could find no records of Abraham ever acquiring or owning the watch though the watch fob was found on Abraham's person the night of his assassination Lincoln also explains that although the watch was been running for a very long time there is no way to open or adjust it Furthermore he could find no power source save for a small gold cylinder Furthermore the watch has a Russian inscription that translates to Made in America suggesting that the watch came from Russian America which is now known as Alaska Lincoln believes that the watch is so advanced that it could not possibly have built by humans leading Lincoln to believe that extraterrestrial beings are beginning to populate Alaska Lincoln requests to use Airship One to travel to Alaska and perform experiments which Taft happily allows
Meanwhile while conversing with Nikola Tesla over a wireless telegraph Airship One picks up a mysterious encryption broadcast on Tesla's line Tesla decrypts the transmission and reveals it to be an exchange between five anonymous gentlemen in Paris Brussels New York Philadelphia and Boma respectively The men have begun mining an unknown substance in the Bonanza mines which they will begin transporting to other parts of the globe in approximately one year The men also hint that they have just caused a mass murder and that they are maintaining unknown operations in Belfast After the transmission Tesla is almost assassinated as a victim of the mass murder but he kills the assassin with one of his inventions
After landing in Washington Taft personally drives Lincoln Wilkie and George Wickersham the Attorney General to the White House wrecking a fish wagon and destroying two of the White House's cars in the process Once there the President is informed that his android which was designed by Thomas Edison as a robotic duplicate of Taft used to simulate his presence while he is away on secret matters has begun to terribly malfunction In an ensuing battle between the automaton and the White House staff and Secret Service the near-indestructible machine repeatedly targets Taft before it is finally destroyed by Taft's friend John Hays Hammond Taft's wife Nellie who is said to be the real authority in the White House insists that Taft join Lincoln on his expedition to Alaska
Once Taft Lincoln Hammond and Captain Archibald Butt Taft's closest friend board Airship One to travel to Alaska they hold a meeting in which they discuss recent events They deduce that the automaton must have been programmed to kill Taft as it repeatedly targeted Taft specifically Lincoln reveals that on the same day that gas from Halley's Comet had been predicted to destroy all life on Earth a mysterious deep blue light was seen in the night sky over the Wrangell Mountains in Alaska near the site of a recent scandal at the Kennecott Mines in which J.P Morgan and the Guggenheim Syndicate were caught mining in areas set aside for conservation This reinforces Lincoln's belief in extraterrestrial activity Hammond who has worked as the Guggenheims chief mining engineer tells the group that miners in the Wrangell mountains were constantly pressured to dig deeper and deeper and that he believes that the Morgan-Guggenheim Syndicate were secretly looking for a different material He remembers that what caused him to quit was frequent mention of Belgian King Leopold II who was notorious for oppressing the natives of the Congo Free State The expedition proves fruitless as Lincoln and the President do not find any extraterrestrial activity or information about the pocket watch
Meanwhile Wilkie and Wickersham travel to New York to talk to J.P Morgan They force him to send them all of his financial reports under threat of federal investigation As Wilkie and Wickersham leave to discuss how they are going to have Miss Knox hired to Morgan's enterprise as a mole it is implied that Morgan is the Gentleman from New York from the Tesla broadcast Months later while working for Morgan Miss Knox has found clues indicating that the International Mercantile Marine Company specifically the White Star Line is at the center of a smuggling operation and she plans to have herself transferred to the Line
Over the next year Lincoln writes to scientists such as Theodor Wulf and Albert Einstein for information about the pocket watch and the blue light over the Wrangells He finds out that the power source in the watch is made of lead a material which can not create the necessary heat to power machinery Lincoln also finds out that the Wrangell mountains possess large quantities of the radioactive element cesium which may have caused the blue light He learns that the Guggenheims have begun shipping material out of the Bonanza mine which was mentioned in the Tesla broadcast meaning that the operation the gentlemen were planning has gone undeterred An inquiry into the U.S Steel Trust which includes Morgan and the Guggenheims has begun and a criminal investigation of the trust is now certain Captain Butt has been promoted to Major and is the President's new aide One night in 1911 Lincoln suddenly remembers that his father accidentally left the pocket watch in Lincoln's room at the White House the night of the assassination He rushes to Washington to tell the President that his father owned the watch In the White House as the Tafts are celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary a disturbance occurs on the East Wing While the Secret Service agents are distracted a silver-plated skull is snuck into the Treaty Room and Taft's son Robert is kidnapped Inside the skull they find a note telling Taft to come alone to the Skull and Bones tomb at Yale University The note states that if Taft does not come Robert will be killed and that if he brings any military or Secret Service or alerts the University New Haven will be destroyed by an unknown superweapon
The night of the meeting Taft enters the building alone and is told by a man named Basil Zaharoff who claims that he works neither for Morgan nor the Guggenheims to sign a document abolishing the U.S Constitution Taft escapes his bonds and kills all of Zaharoff's mercenaries with his bare hands while Zaharoff escapes Meanwhile Lincoln Wilkie and his Secret Service agents discover the superweapon in Yale's underground steam tunnels in the form of capsules of elemental cesium mined Believing that the highly explosive cesium would be used to destroy the university with a large explosion Lincoln collects the capsules to test them The rescue team rescues Robert and advances through the halls of the University killing many enemies while Buffalo soldiers sharpshooter provide cover fire from the Airship Wickersham Wilkie Lincoln Taft and Robert are safely returned to the zeppelin As they fly to Washington it is deduced that Zaharoff was the Gentleman from Paris from the Tesla broadcast and that Morgan and the Guggenheims could not have been responsible After testing the capsules Lincoln realizes that the superweapon is not an explosive but rather an aerosol the steam tunnels would have been powered up and the steam would have carry the extremely corrosive cesium up into New Haven corroding the town away and killing all its citizens Based on the Belgian bullets and guns the enemies were carrying it is deduced that they were from the Belgian Congo After a Congolese butterfly is found in Zaharoff's briefcase Taft and Lincoln travel to the Congo to investigate The crew finds a house in the middle of the jungle that belongs to insane murderous Belgian military officer Leon Rom who is found to have been the Gentleman from Boma The crew kill Rom but are taken aback by his level of psychosis
Taft Wilkie Lincoln and several Secret Service agents travel to London for a meeting with The Colossus set up by Miss Knox The Colossus Who turns out to be Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Reveals that Miss Knox is really Violet Jessop After hearing that the pocket watch's power source is made of lead Doyle explains that the watch was originally powered by uranium and the lead is the uranium in its decayed state The group soon realizes that the uranium gold copper in the watch and the gold-bearing quartz in the watch fob were all mined in the Kennecott Mines and Doyle guesses that the watch was constructed by Russian minister Eduard de Stoeckl to facilitate the Alaska Purchase by proving that the land contained precious materials After learning that Zaharoff has a duplicate of the watch made from silver Doyle guesses that Zaharoff stumbled upon the design for the watch and developed the idea for the superweapon which he created from Alaskan uranium Robert realizes that the blue lights in the sky over the Wrangells were caused by a test of the weapon which was purposely performed when Earth passed by Halley's Comet to mask the effects However Robert also realizes that to do substantial damage the superweapon would have to be the size of three city blocks and would require the use of steam Doyle realizes that the plan from the beginning was to activate the superweapon via the steam tunnels of the RMS Titanic
On April 14 1912 Taft Robert and Wilkie are aboard Airship One while Nellie is aboard the SS Californian and Butt is already aboard the Titanic After meeting up with Miss Knox who is now a waitress aboard the ship Archie boards the deck of the ship and prepares to fight The three men aboard the airship along with the men who provided cover fire during the New Haven raid descend upon the ship Mercenaries soon kill the captain and hold Taft hostage The men are greeted by J.P Morgan and Leopold II the Gentleman from Brussels who had faked his death to escape disgrace
Leopold reveals that he has killed Benjamin Guggenheim who was the Gentleman from Philadelphia from the Tesla broadcast Leopold has chosen to attack the United States with his weapon because the United States was the first country to expose Leopold's brutalities in the Congo Free State Crippling the United States will plunge the world into war and when the great powers collapse Zaharoff and Leopold will become the most powerful people on Earth Taft escapes and runs after Leopold while Wilkie and Lincoln are chased around by Morgan who is actually an android As passengers take arms and fight Leopold's men Airship One is shot down and crashes onto the deck Meanwhile Robert shorts out the power on the ship preventing use of the superweapon As Taft and Wilkie prepare to leave it is revealed to a shocked Taft that Wilkie is really ex-president Theodore Roosevelt The Californian arrives to aid the Secret Service and rescue Taft and the others Taft throws the badly wounded Roosevelt to a lifeboat but before Taft can jump the Titanic begins to rise out of the water Leopold sees Taft jumping and prepares to shoot him but Butt subdues the monarch as the rising waters rush over and kill them Taft jumps off the ship and is reeled aboard the Californian
Passengers aboard the Titanic who fought against Leopold are delivered to the U.S and given new lives by the American and British governments The public is told that the Titanic collided with an iceberg and sank while the real story is kept a state secret J.P Morgan is forced to appear in court for an investigation of his money trust and dies from stress three months later Butt is given a state funeral and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery Taft is not reelected for a second term but in 1921 President Warren Harding offers him a position as Chief Justice of the United States Taft and Lincoln are briefly reunited at the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial where it is revealed that the pocket watch saved Robert's life on the Titanic by catching a bullet
In 1936 an extremely rich and healthy Zaharoff is living comfortably at the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo Zaharoff laments that working for Leopold had been a mistake as Leopold relied to heavily on lunatics such as Rom and had lucrative motives Zaharoff suddenly begins to go into convulsions as his maid who is actually Miss Knox steals from him the designs for the pocket watch and his silver duplicate of the watch Miss Knox poisons Zaharoff and delivers the watch to Nellie Nellie mails the watch to Lyman James Briggs chairman of the Uranium Committee along with a letter from President Franklin D Roosevelt detailing the use of uranium as a weapon As Nellie who has always had a negative opinion of the Roosevelt family ponders working with President Roosevelt she opposes her anti-Roosevelt stand by stating I like these Roosevelts
Characters
Primary characters
William Howard Taft is the 27th President of the United States for most of the novel Taft loves his wife Nellie more than anyone and was deeply saddened during her period of extended illness Nellie persuaded Taft to run for President so that she could influence Taft to implement her political agenda though he desires to be Chief Justice Throughout the book he is shown to be in surprisingly good shape despite his weight He is not very knowledgeable in matters regarding science or history but is surprisingly intelligent and deductive
Robert Todd Lincoln is the only remaining son of former President Abraham Lincoln and a highly respected figure in the world of science This is a departure from Lincoln's real-life profile as in reality Lincoln was never involved in science However his lifelong interest in astronomy is faithfully depicted in the novel as is his personal observatory at his Manchester mansion Hildene Robert is always looking for information about his father's assassination This desire causes Robert to discover the watch thus setting the plot of the book in motion
Archibald Butt is captain of Airship One and Taft's closest personal friend After Taft's personal aide Charles Dyer Norton is fired Taft personally hires Butt to take Norton's place During the raids of New Haven and the Titanic Butt is portrayed to be a talented strategist and commander as shown when he expertly directs the sharpshooters to provide cover for the protagonists Butt is shown to think a lot about his mother and has a near-romantic relationship with Miss Knox
Theodore Roosevelt is one of the most depicted characters in the book but in most of his appearances he is disguised as Secret Service Chief John Wilkie Roosevelt's wartime experience makes him a strong leader of the Secret Service as demonstrated by his skills in combat Roosevelt's resourcefulness is another distinguishing quality Roosevelt is able to significantly damage the android by creating a makeshift Molotov cocktail and is clever enough to short out the power by shooting Tesla's electric rifle at the android of J.P Morgan He is able to effectively fool Taft and the others with his disguise for several years though he expresses disdain for Wilkie's habit of smoking cigars which he must enact to maintain his disguise Nellie Taft often voices her suspicion that Wilkie is a spy working for Theodore Roosevelt which is in a sense true
Miss Knox is an elite Secret Service agent She is highly trained in martial arts and can easily get herself hired and transferred throughout companies as she pleases She is one of the Secret Service's most talented agents as shown by the effectiveness with which she investigates the White Star Line under the alias of Violet Jessop In real life after the Titanic sank Violet Jessop served on its sister ships the Olympic and the Britannic suggesting that Miss Knox's character would have continued to monitor the Line even after the Taft administration is out of the White House
Secondary Characters

Basil Zaharoff is a Greek arms dealer and the Gentleman from Paris from the Tesla broadcast Zaharoff first conceptualized the superweapon after seeing the designs for the pocket watch and developed it from the cesium mined in Alaska He serves as the main facilitator of Leopold's plans

J.P Morgan is a famous millionaire businessman Drawn into Leopold's plan for world domination Morgan believed that he would become even more powerful than he was however it is implied that Leopold has merely used Morgan for his wealth and power planning to kill him once the plan is complete
Benjamin Guggenheim is a world-renowned mining magnate Though unseen in the novel Guggenheim plays a key role in Leopold's plot by providing Leopold and Zaharoff access to his uranium mines He was likely drawn into the plot just as Morgan was and Leopold has him killed before he can claim his reward

Reception
When reviewing Yohioloid the Vocaloid 3 software was given a 7/10 by Hollin Jones of the website MusicTech Jones in his review noted that despite it being easy to use the software had a steep learning curve and investing time and effort was the only way to get results However when listing off the pros and cons of the software he did note that Vocaloid was as close to realism that one can get but he noted it was better as a back up singer He noted that there was still a great deal of artificiality to the sound and its not possible to get Vocaloid to mimic a singer like Adele He felt the Vocaloid software was more aimed at a electronic pop genre and in regards to the Yohioloid vocal itself perhaps aimed at a Japanese market despite the fact Yohioloid was a western built Vocaloid
It was also noted that for English vocaloids Oliver and Avanna though they were completed a significant delay was reported by studios between the completion of their developments and release In regards to Avanna at one point it appeared Zero-G themselves did not know when she was going to be released Another issue was that Avanna's originally concept was of an Elf as Avanna was aimed to be a fantasy theme vocal but this was rejected by Yamaha themselves in favour of a anime style of artwork Previously they had not shown any signs of directing the studios towards one particular direction The artist of the illustration for Avanna also theorized this had something to do with the large negative reaction that followed the original concept for Spanish vocals Bruno and Clara
Hatsune Miku remained the most popular vocal for the software Upon release she overloaded the yamaha server as users made activation requests As well as this a backlog of 10,000 copies of her software was reported at one stage as supplies failed to meet the demand

On her next appearance Proud Spell started the odds-on favorite when matched againt Godolphin Racing's filly Music Note in the Grade I Mother Goose Stakes over nine furlongs at Belmont on June 28 The filly stumbled badly exiting the starting stalls and had a rough trip being blocked when attempting a forward move two furlong out She finished second behind Music Note but was demoted to third place after hanging sharply to the right and hampering Never Retreat in the stretch Larry Jones commented from the beginning it looked like it wasnÅft going to be our day When we needed somewhere to go we had nowhere to go And when it was time to go we werenÅft going Proud Spell was then dropped in class to contest the Delaware Oaks on July 12 and started the 0.3/1 favorite against five opponents Conceding at least six pounds to her rivals she tracked the leader African Violet before taking the lead inside the final furlong and winning by three-quarters of a length

On her next appearance Proud Spell was assigned top weight of 124 pounds but nevertheless started odds-on favorite for the Grade II Cotillion Handicap at Philadelphia Park on September 20 After tracking the leaders she was bumped when attempting to make a forward move in the straight and finished second two and a half lengths behind the winner Seattle Smooth After the race Brereton Jones announced that the filly would be rested before probably returning in 2009 He said that Saez had been given a lesson in race riding by the other jockeys in the Cotillion but added IÅfm going to stick with him heÅfs a great kid and I think heÅfs going to be a Hall of Fame jockey one day

Proud Spell remained in training as a four-year-old in 2009 making her first and only appearance in a minor race at Oaklawn Park on March 12 She started the 1/5 favorite but was beaten two and a half lengths by Superior Storm She developed a leg infection after the race and her retirement was announced on April 13 Brereton Jones explined The infection would not have caused her retirement were we not already thinking about retiring her We had made the decision to race her this year and we felt comfortable with that but when she got the infection it meant we couldnÅft make the Apple Blossom because she needed a work So we retired her
Assessment and awards
In the 2007 Experimental Free Handicap Proud Spell was rated the third-best two-year-old filly in the United States She was the highest-earning three-year-old filly of the year in the United States in 2008 and the eighth-highest money winner of any age or sex In the Eclipse Awards for 2008 Proud Spell was named American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly On receiving the award Brereton Jones said No horse has ever passed her in the stretch during her entire racing career and thatÅfs a big statement when youÅfve been running against the best fillies in America whilst The Blood-Horse described her as one of the grittiest runners on the track today
In 2014 Proud Spell was inducted into Fair Grounds Race Course's local Hall of Fame On accepting the award Larry Jones said Proud Spell had such perseverance She always gave her all I've always said you can learn as much about what makes good character from a horse as you can from other people and Proud Spell was the perfect example of that
Breeding record
Since her retirement from racing Proud Spell has produced at least three foals


Eulalia Norman Park

Eulalia is a heritage-listed villa at 75 McIllwraith Avenue Norman Park Queensland Australia It was built in 1889 It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992
History
Eulalia is a single-storeyed brick house which was constructed in 1889 The land on which the house stands was first bought by August Dimper who purchased 88 acres in 1860 In 1888 the land was further subdivided and 22 acres was purchased by Patrick Real
In the following year Real employed Brisbane architects John Hall & Sons to design a house for the site and Morley Whitehead of Ipswich were subsequently contracted to build Eulalia a Greek word meaning speaking well of everybody At this period John Smith Murdoch was employed in the office of John Hall and Sons and it is possible that he may have been the designer for Eulalia
Patrick Real was the son of impoverished Irish emigrants and left school at twelve to become an apprentice carpenter and later to work at the North Ipswich Railway Workshops After deciding on a legal career he studied law and was admitted to the bar at the age of twenty-seven By the time he built Eulalia in 1889 his practice was one of the largest in Queensland Real was appointed to the Supreme Court of Queensland bench in 1890 and in 1903 he became Senior Puisne Judge He retired in 1922 and died in 1928
After Real's death the house was closed and left vacant for a decade during which time it fell victim to vandals and the weather becoming known locally as the haunted house Most of the land had been subdivided and sold by 1925 leaving a property of about 2.2 hectares surrounding the house
In 1938 Eulalia was bought by Stanley and Sheilah Hancock who restored the property discovering many items in the gardens where they had been discarded by vandals and re-instating them in the house
The Hancock family first arrived in Queensland when they moved from Sydney to Ipswich in the late 1850s The family established a successful timber milling business which involved five generations of the Hancock family and continued until the late 1970s Stanley Hancock was president of the National Trust of Queensland from 1974 to 1978 This was a period when a number of National Trust of Queensland properties were established including Bellevue Homestead Claremont and Brennan & Geraghtys Store
Whilst Eulalia was a family home for the Hancocks they also used it as a venue for fundraising functions for a number of Brisbane charities
This public use of Eulalia was further expanded in 1965 when the Hancocks established Early Street Historical Village in the grounds of Eulalia The establishment of the Village is the earliest known example of the Queensland practice of creating historical villages by moving various buildings to one central site It is therefore demonstrative of the development of conservation practice and theory in Queensland
Early Street Historical Village closed in 1998 having reached the end of its life in terms of public appreciation The other buildings on the site were auctioned off most were relocated to outer suburban sites for use as housing
Description
Built on a prominent hill with expansive views Eulalia is a single- storeyed house with two rear wings rendered brick walls and a hipped slate roof
The entire block on which Eulalia and the adjacent Early Street Historical Village are located is planted with mature gums palm trees bunya pines jacarandas and bougainvillea and many other species making it a dominant landmark in an otherwise typical suburban setting and one of the few surviving examples of mature planting in the area These plantings are also instrumental in conveying an impression of the original semi-rural setting of Eulalia
Associated structures on the site include a tank stand and a substantially modified coach house
The house faces north and comprises a pedimented entrance porch leading onto a wide verandah flanked by two projecting bays The verandah continues around three sides of the house featuring a cast iron balustrade separated by tapered octagonal timber posts with decorative capitals and fretwork brackets The principal timber is beech
Tessellated floor tiles continue from the slate steps at the porch through the entry and into the wide hallway The main door is panelled with leaded glass sidelights and an etched fanlight featuring gum leaves a swallow and a dragonfly A similarly lit doorway is located at the opposite end of the hall On the right of the hallway are separate drawing and dining rooms the former incorporating a window bay with Doric fluted columns and pilasters on either side and the latter a set of cedar folding doors which can be folded back to create one large area incorporating the hallway On the left of the hall are the master bed dressing and sitting rooms
Joinery throughout the house is of cedar including architraves and pedimented overdoors which reach almost to the plaster cornice of sixteen feet high ceilings The ornate drawing room mantelpiece is of a mahogany whilst others are of oak The long sash windows which open from the main rooms onto the verandah feature hinged dog-doors at floor level At the end of the hall the house divides into two wings one dowel- balustraded verandah on the left leading to the bathroom and two bedrooms and the other on the right to the former study and service rooms including a kitchen pantry maid's room and laundry A large cellar is located beneath this wing
Heritage listing
Eulalia was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland&apos;s history
Constructed in 1889 Eulalia and its grounds are important for the evidence they provide of the way of life of prosperous citizens in the outer reaches of Brisbane in the late nineteenth century
The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places
The house is important as an example of a fine quality 1880s Queensland residence of masonry construction that is substantially intact both externally and internally It is also an uncommon example of a 19th century residence still located in substantial grounds which separate it from the surrounding suburban development The grounds and gardens which contain mature plantings including gums palm trees bunya pines jacarandas and bougainvillea contribute to the overall integrity of the place
The place is important because of its aesthetic significance
It has several rare and highly decorative architectural features including the verandahs surrounding the bay windows and their finely detailed verandah posts and brackets These features combined with the fine quality of interior finishes and fittings including cedar joinery internal pilasters and columns and flooring of tessellated tiles give Eulalia considerable aesthetic significance
The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social cultural or spiritual reasons
Its prominent location and mature plantings ensure that the entire site is a significant landmark in the area
The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person group or organisation of importance in Queensland&apos;s history
Eulalia is significant for its association with its first owner the Hon Patrick Real Senior who was a prominent Brisbane lawyer and Puisne Judge in the early 1890s and is perpetuated in the surrounding streets including Judge Patrick and Real Streets Katherine Street is named after a family member
It is also significant for its association with its second owner Stanley Hancock who was President of the National Trust of Queensland from 1974 to 1978 and was influential in the early conservation of Queensland's heritage
Eulalia also has strong association with the adjacent Early Street Historical Village established in 1965 in conjunction with the house by the Hancocks as the first known heritage property in Queensland to be promoted as a tourist and educational attraction


Cliffside Apartments

Cliffside Apartments is a heritage-listed apartment block at 76 Lower River Terrace Kangaroo Point Queensland Australia It was built from 1936 to 1937 It is also known as Cliffiside Flats It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 February 2004
History
Cliffside Apartments a five storey masonry building prominently located on the cliffs at Kangaroo Point was built in 1936-37 to the design of architect and engineer Ronald Martin Wilson The building is sited on two blocks originally part of an early land purchase by John and George Harris in 1855 The land passed through the hands of several owners until it was purchased by Mrs Doris R Booth at the beginning of 1930 At the time that Mrs Booth bought the site it was a sheer cliff of solid porphyry with a railway and wharves at its base
Mrs Booth was born in 1895 in a house named Cliffside next to the railway gates on the cliff at Kangaroo Point She married Captain Charles Booth in 1919 and together they travelled to New Guinea in 1920 Mrs Booth distinguished herself by breaking convention and securing her own miner's right and then becoming a licensed recruiter of labour She was the only resident white woman in the Bulolo Valley and stayed there alone in her house also named Cliffside while her husband prospected at Edie Creek From September 1926 to January 1927 she organized and managed a racially segregated bush hospital to control a dysentery epidemic She received an O.B.E for this work in 1928 Later that year in London she recorded these and other adventures in Mountains Gold and Cannibals which was written with the assistance of M O'Dwyer
Mrs Booth returned to New Guinea in 1929 and gradually wrested control over the family business affairs from her husband whom she left in 1932 The Booths became embroiled in an acrimonious court case when in 1933 Charles Booth sued in the Central Court of the Territory of New Guinea for restitution of property The case was a test case as no Mandated Territory law explicitly safeguarded married women's property rights Judge F B Phillips held that British and Australian Acts passed before 1921 superseded the common law notion of male control of joint property and gave Mrs Booth the verdict The judgement was upheld in a subsequent appeal in the High Court of Australia and territorial law was amended by the Status of Married Women Ordinance 1935-36 Booth returned to prospecting and Mrs Booth went on to become a successful mine manager and company director and amongst other achievements was appointed as the sole woman member of the first and second Legislative Councils of Papua and New Guinea in 1951-57
The construction of Cliffside in 1936-37 attested to Doris Booth's extraordinary independent effort and acumen After securing the land adjacent to her childhood home Mrs Booth granted power of attorney to her sister Mrs Selma Dore who took responsibility for supervising the design and construction of the building Work on the ambitious project began in late 1935 when R Martin Wilson began his first drawings Wilson was both an architect and engineer and it is possible that he was commissioned on the basis of his engineering expertise a skill that would obviously be required on this job However both Wilson and Doris Booth had close connections with the Burns Philp Company and it is possible that this connection brought them together Burns Philp Ltd had financed the Booths first foray into the goldfields of New Guinea and Wilson and his father had provided extensive architectural services to the company
A tender notice appeared in the Architects and Builders Journal of Queensland in June 1936 and George Mitchell's tender was accepted in July A Special Note in the Bill of Quantities stated that Contractors are advised to visit and inspect the site and satisfy themselves as to the nature of excavations to be carried out as it is anticipated rock will be met with No blasting will be allowed All excavations in rock to be done by the use of an air compressor Wilson went on to specify that all rock and fill from the excavations was to be re-used to form terraces steps and paving
Cliffside was considered the height of modernity when it was opened in June 1937 The Telegraph reported on June 7 that Cliffside Flats at River Terrace Kangaroo Point have given Brisbane an example of the most advanced flat design in Australia Although the practice of converting houses to flats was well established in Brisbane the development of the purpose-designed flat was slower in Brisbane than in other parts of the country The Telegraph described that Until quite recently the flat-habit was looked on by Brisbane with mixed feelings of disfavour and doubt but now the general desire for easier living coupled with the acute problem of obtaining competent domestics is spreading the flat-habit over a wider field The article went on to expound the virtues of properly designed and planned flats of which Cliffside was the foremost example
Cliffside was equipped with all modern conveniences including built-in furniture dining nooks and serverys electric refrigerators electric hot water water softening and incinerator and laundry chutes The design of the building maximised privacy views light and the flow of air Each of the eight flats had their own private entrance and floors were sound-proofed The slope of the site was used to advantage so that no more than one and a half flights of stairs had to be scaled to gain access to any one of them Plumbing connections were housed in a special duct with access from outside the building so that maintenance and repairs could take place without bothering the tenants A caretaker's quarters was part of the original design as was the provision of lock-up garages The building was designed in the popular interwar style of English Revival or Tudor Revival with elements such as eaves and bay windows having a half-timbered appearance As the promotional literature stated Cliffside was the newest the best and the most attractive offering in Brisbane
At the opening of Cliffside on June 10 Alderman Louis Luckins announced that the Brisbane City Council was introducing new bylaws to regulate the standards of construction and design of flat buildings emphasising however that not everyone would be able to achieve the heights of quality embodied in Cliffside These ordinances were ratified by the Executive Council of Brisbane City Council in August 1937 and dealt with issues such as plot ratios sanitation and fire rating 1936-37 was the peak time for interwar flat construction in Queensland In the following years construction decreased due to the uncertain investment climate created by the threat of war in Europe as well as the refusal of banking institutions to lend on flat constructions
Cliffside is a fine example of the work of R Martin Wilson and demonstrates his skill in the fields of both architecture and engineering Born in Brisbane in 1886 he was the son of architect Alexander Brown Wilson and studied and worked with his father from 1902-8 He received a Bachelor of Engineering at the University of Queensland in 1915 and won the Walter and Eliza Hill Travelling Fellowship allowing him to study architectural engineering in the United States from 1915 to 1917 He went on to London and studied at the Architectural Association as well as completing a town planning course at London University From 1919 he lectured in engineering at University of Queensland and was the first person to gain a Masters in Engineering at that institution
He practised with his father as Alex B and R Martin Wilson Architects and Architectural Engineers Brisbane from 1920 becoming a registered architect in 1929 He was active in professional bodies such as the Institute of Architects and the Town Planning Association Alex Wilson retired in 1928 and R M Wilson was later joined by his son Blair in the firm of R M Wilson and Son

Life and professional career
As son of a farmer and wine producer Werner Doppler managed the family farm on his own for some years After this he studied Agriculture and Economics at the universities of Hohenheim and Kiel in Germany He did his PhD in Economics under the guidance of Gunther Weinschenck in 1974 in the field of Application of recursive linear mathematical models to analyze and predict regional development in the agricultural sector He then joined the research team of Hans-Hartwig Ruthenberg as research scientist dealing with the development in the Tropics and Sub Tropics In this period he spent research semesters at the University of Bradford/England and at the International Rice Research Institute IRRI in the Philippines This period ended with the ÅgHabilitationÅh the German assessment for the qualification of a university professorship From 1979 to 1981 he joined the University of Nairobi/ Kenya as Associate Professor until he got the position of Professor at the University of Hohenheim Germany in the field of farm management in the tropics and sub tropics
Werner Doppler married Dorothea Frank in 1970 They have two sons Fabian and Leander and a daughter Adriane
Lectures and academic training
The main focus in teaching was the application of quantitative socioeconomic methods and holistic approaches in farming and rural development in developing countries Werner Doppler gave lectures in MasterÅfs and PhD programs at the universities of Hohenheim Karlsruhe and University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]]/Germany and at the University of Nairobi/Kenya University of Florence/Italy Universities of Amman/Jordan Bradford/U.K Thai Nguyen and Hanoi/Vietnam as well as in the Lutheran University in Palmas/Brazil
At the European Union level Werner Doppler was involved in internationalizing the postgraduate university programs in accordance with the guidelines of the Bologna Process During his time as Dean of Faculty at the University of Hohenheim he was responsible for the decisions preparations and introduction of the international concept of BSc./MSc curricula and the European academic transfer system in 1997 as well as for the introduction of the first formalized international PhD program for students from developing countries in 1991 While he was director of the International PhD program in Hohenheim funded by the German Academic Exchange Service DAAD 104 students from 33 different overseas countries finished their PhD degree Under his direct supervision 57 from 25 countries did their PhD research
Research
In farming systems research Werner Doppler combines the descriptive and comparative approach represented by Hans-Hartwig Ruthenberg who explains the development process by analyzing the past with quantitative methods in agriculture and economic research e.g Earl O Heady R.H Day and G Weinschenck As a result quantitative systems models for simulating future rural development are available which allow measuring the impact of future strategies in development projects and developing countries
In a further step space in rural areas has become another dimension through information provided by integrating remote sensing in the methodological concept With this Geographical Information Systems GIS can be applied and the economic models for future development extended to comprehensive spatial rural development models which allow a high degree of internalization of problems processes and decisions
The application of classical farm management in developing countries is expanded by social ecological and cultural influences in decision-making of families with similar consequences in the evaluation of development strategies Werner Doppler considers living standard of families as central at the micro level and defines it with economic food and health related social and dependency-on-resource-owner and risk criteria At the level of the society in a rural area rural welfare is applied and defined as the sum of the living standard of all social groups in the region plus ecological social and cultural aspects considered relevant from a societal point of view Socioeconomic analyses and assessments of future strategies may show different results at the micro or societal level and indicate conflicts which can be seen in ecological misuse of resources
The relationship between family and society also shows a vertical link in decision-making and dependencies and may function as Ågbottom-upÅh or Ågtop-downÅh between families communes ethnic groups projects markets regional administration and even the national level This is especially relevant for availability use and prices/costs of land water labor capital social network and social security as well as skills and knowledge
With all these extensions in at various levels of the methodology Werner Doppler aims at a holistic approach in analyzing the past and the present and forecasting the future to better meet real life conditions of people and give more practical relevance to the quantification and assessment of impacts of future strategies
The empirical research of Werner Doppler was exclusively related to developing countries The research focus was on the impact of future problem-solving strategies on the living standard of families and rural welfare in the following fields
In all research programs the issues of food security mobility and human migration the regional administrative capacity as well as regulations in ownership/renting and hiring rights regulations in market infrastructure and social services and the cultural framework have been elements in the concepts and their evaluation
The research programs have been carried out in cooperation with seven international research centers of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research CGIAR and with 26 universities in Africa Asia and Latin America

Craig McDonald

Craig McDonald is a journalist and the author of The Hector Lassiter series The Chris Lyon series the standalone novel El Gavilan as well as two collections of interviews with fellow fiction writers Art in the Blood 2006 and Rogue Males 2009
Born in Columbus Ohio he grew up in Grove City Ohio a fictionalized version of which serves as the setting for his 2011 work of fiction El Gavilan McDonaldÅfs debut novel Head Games 2007 was nominated for the Edgar Award the Anthony Award and the Gumshoe Award in the U.S for best first novel as well as the 2011 Selection du prix polar Saint-Maur en Poche in France
Writing
For many years Craig McDonald has steadily balanced his award-winning efforts as a journalist?functioning variously as reporter columnist and editor?while maintaining a fiction-writing career of notable international profile
In 2006 he published a collection of interviews with crime and thriller writers Art In the Blood praised for its in-depth conversations with a whoÅfs who of genre novelists discussing the craft of writing A critically-acclaimed sequel Rogue Males followed in 2009 from Bleak House Books
In 2007 McDonald published his debut novel Head Games which quickly garnered major awards attention including Edgar Award and Anthony Award nominations for Best First Novel by an American Author
Head Games featured fictional novelist/screenwriter Hector Lassiter a character McDonald introduced in a highly praised 2005 short story The Last Interview that was selected for an online Mississippi Review anthology of ÅgHigh PulpÅh and subsequently selected for print anthologies and short story collections
The Lassiters constitute McDonaldÅfs most noted and consistently praised fictional works They have been translated into numerous languages some going on to achieve international best-seller status A graphic novel of Head Games is in production
Writing style/major themes
Hallmarks of McDonaldÅfs fictional works include consistent use of historical crimes and personages including several appearances by Ernest Hemingway and Orson Welles over the course of the series
The voice and style of the Lassiter novels have drawn favorable comparisons to a wide range of authors frequently mentioned are James Crumley and James Ellroy both of whom McDonald interviewed as a journalist and whom he has confirmed in interviews and essays as significant influences as well as James Carlos Blake and Jack Kerouac among others
In 2010 crime fiction critic and scholar Woody Haut declared McDonald Ågone of the few writers who can move comfortably within a post-Ellroy framework of crime fiction.Åh
In addition to noting his tendency to write in a historical fiction vein ala Ellroy and Blake critics and scholars have focused on McDonaldÅfs exploration of the male psyche and critiques of masculine influences on popular culture and 20th Century art and history
In her seminal study The Noir Thriller Palgrave Macmillan 2009 in a chapter examining ÅgLiterary Noir in the Twenty-First Century,Åh Lee Horsley identified McDonald as one of several Ågneo-noirÅh authors who embody Åga recurrent motif of men in pursuit of a lost treacherously illusive notion of masculinityÅcÅh in which ÅgÅcnarratives are shaped to expose the cost of pretending to a toughness one doesnÅft possess.Åh Horsley goes onto quote McDonald from an interview with Scottish novelist Tony Black in which McDonald says of his 1957-set Head Games ÅgI wanted to write a novel that took a hard look at a certain kind of masculinity that has for better or worse kind of passed from the scene I wanted to look at a the cost of acquiring maintaining and ultimately losing a grip on that kind of masculinity.Åh
Picking up a similar theme Woody Haut critiquing McDonaldÅfs second-published novel commented ÅgBy portraying Hemingway and Hector Lassiter warts and all Toros & Torsos from the novelÅfs opening scene to its denouement critiques the effect of masculine values on the culture and examines the relationship between reality and fiction.Åh
Hector Lassiter known to readers and critics as Ågthe man who writes what he lives and lives what he writes,Åh eventually comes to use himself as a character in his own novels as the series unfolds The Lassiter novels brim with metatextual undertones and veiled commentary regarding not just the craft of creation but artistic mediums themselves including painting and sculpture Toros & Torsos 2008 fiction writing Print the Legend 2010 and One True Sentence 2011 television The Running Kind 2014 and cinema Roll the Credits 2014
Yet McDonald has also been praised by critics and fellow authors for his knowing and sensitive portrayals of female characters Critic Jen Forbus commenting on Toros & Torsos noted of Hector Lassiter ÅgHe can be a womanizer but he can also be attuned to women often more so than the other men around Lassiter.Åh
In speaking about One True Sentence and the character Brinke Devlin in a public event in Arizona in 2011 novelist James Sallis said of the character ÅgI loved her the first time she came on the page and I loved her at the end too She's a fascinating character Those of us who are male writers can really appreciate how difficult it is to write such a strong and believable female character.Åh

The Hector Lassiter series
One True Sentence Hector Lassiter series #1
One True Sentence was first published by St MartinÅfs Press Minotaur in February 2011 In original publication sequence it was the fourth Lassiter novel to appear European publisher Betimes Books re-issued One True Sentence in August 2014 as the first installment of the series which Betimes determined to present in chronological order for the first time
The novel is set in Paris France during one week of February in 1924 and revolves around the members of the Lost Generation
Hector Lassiter young and relatively unknown is struggling to find his voice and to establish himself as a novelist A new vogue is gaining ground in Paris and threatening the lives of HectorÅfs closest friends ? a literary movement that embraces nihilism ÅgNada,Åh a despair-driven cult impels its disciples to acts of murder and self-destruction One by one the editors of Left Bank literary magazines are falling prey to savage attacks As the killings escalate the literati including Gertrude Stein HectorÅfs best friend Ernest Hemingway and the dark mysterious novelist Brinke Devlin form their own improbable vigilante band to catch the killers
One True Sentence achieved international critical acclaim including praise from Library Journal the Dayton Daily News and several fellow novelists including Charlie Stella Craig Holden Ace Atkins Diana Gabaldon and Duane Swierczynski The novel along with Toros & Torsos and Print the Legend also received significant scholarly attention in Robert McFarland's Appropriating Hemingway McFarland & Company Inc 2014 a critical work examining Hemingway's use by other authors as a fictional character
McDonald humanizes these literary icons like only he can I have always found the Lassiter novels to be intelligent rich and thought-provoking but One True Sentence takes the series to a new level This one has it all mystique intrigue mystery erotica murder the occult ?"Signs and Wonders
Lassiter is always engaged in the writing process even in the midst of murder and romance his thoughts wandering to a story or the theme of his first novel It is in this regard that McDonald excels connecting the writer to his environment be it a tumble in the sheets in a menage a trios or facing certain death at the hands of a murderer Hector never takes anything for granted and never underestimates his environment as McDonald spins a twisted tale of writers their passions and their pasts ? Curled Up With A Good Book
One True Sentence like the three books before it is a work of art Hector Lassiter consistently finds himself in various artistic communities and it's fitting The novels are full of spirit and creativity and individuality Experiencing the work of Craig McDonald is akin to experiencing a painting by Picasso a dance by Baryshnikov music by Tchaikovsky No two people will experience it exactly the same but everyone who does experience it will walk away richer ?Jen Forbus Jen's Book Thoughts
The author draws them with a breathtaking at times unflattering accuracy Nevertheless it is the fictional character of mystery writer Brinke Devlin who steals the spotlight One True Sentence has almost the feel of a memoir but overlaid with?or cloaked by?a traditional mystery of its time period ?Naomi Johnson The Drowning Machine
McDonald has a lot of fun peppering the legendary milieu with literary in-jokes and trivia while still crafting a compelling and complex mystery which engrosses and surprises to the very end The Lassiter series is unique in crime fiction a hardboiled take on the twentieth century through the lens of a no nonsense pulp writer savvy in both high and low culture One True Sentence is a fine addition and leaves the reader eager for his next appearance ?"Radio Free UBU
VERDICT Certain to attract Hemingway aficionados and readers who enjoy hard-boiled historical crime fiction ?Library Journal

13th Field Regiment Australia

The 13th Field Regiment was an Australian Army artillery regiment During World War I the unit was formed in early 1916 as the 13th Field Artillery Brigade and fought as part of the 5th Division in Egypt the Sinai and on the Western Front After the war it was re-raised as a part-time unit based in the state of South Australia It was redesignated as the 13th Field Regiment during the early years of World War II and following Japan's entry into the war it was mobilised and later deployed to New Guinea where a detachment fought during the Battle of Buna?Gona in 1942?43 returning to Australia in late 1943 After the war the regiment was re-formed in 1948 in South Australia and remained in existence until being disbanded in 1975
History
During World War I the regiment was designated the 13th Field Artillery Brigade and was assigned to the 5th Division Formed in February 1916 it served in Egypt the Sinai and on the Western Front Its recruits were mainly drawn from the state of Victoria After the war when Australia's part-time military forces were reorganised in 1921 to replicate the divisional structure and numerical designations of the First Australian Imperial Force the unit was re-raised in South Australia as part of the 4th Military District adopting the designation of the 13th Field Brigade It was one of three field brigades assigned to the 4th Division at this time
In 1940?41 the regimental system was introduced for Militia artillery units with the previously existing field brigades being redesignated as regiments and the designation of the 13th Field Regiment was adopted Following Japan's entry in to World War II the regiment was mobilised as part of the 3rd Brigade Its component batteries during the early war years were the 48th 49th 50th and 113th Field Batteries The regiment was initially a unit of the AMF but militia units with more than 75% volunteers could be identified as AIF units and the 13th was subsquently redesignated as such
It was subsquently deployed to New Guinea During the Battle of Buna?Gona in 1942?43 the regiment deployed a troop of four guns under command of Captain N.R Stokes These were QF 4.5-inch howitzers Two of these guns were flown to Dobodura on 20 December Two were transported by sea and landed at Hariko on 23 December The troop was initially positioned on the Dobodura?Buna track This was about 2,500 yards 2,200 m south of the bridge between the two strips The troop fired in support of the US 32nd Division during fighting at Buna The troop later moved to a position near Giropa Point to support the Allied attacks to take the final Japanese positions at Sanananda and Giruwa
The 13th Field Regiment remained in New Guinea until October 1943 when it was withdrawn back to Australia Throughout 1944 the regiment undertook training on the Atherton Tablelands and was re-assigned to the 11th Division It remained in Australia until the end of the war when the regiment's personnel were demobilised and the regiment disbanded
Following the war Australia's part-time military force was re-raised in 1948 at which time the 13th Field Regiment was re-formed in South Australia The 48th Battery returned to the 13th Field Regiment's order of battle in June 1966 when the regiment's battery designations were changed In 1975 the 13th Field Regiment was disbanded and some of its component batteries such as the 48th which was based in Adelaide became independent
In 1988 the 6th/13th Field Regiment Royal Australian Artillery was formed by merging the 6th and 13th Field Regiments but this unit was disbanded in 1997 with its components being absorbed into the 16th and 48th Field Batteries In mid-2013 these batteries were reduced to troop-sized elements and the 6th/13th Light Battery was formed


Sony Pictures Entertainment hack

The Sony Pictures Entertainment cyberhack was a release of confidential data belonging to Sony Pictures Entertainment on November 24 2014 The data included personal information about Sony Pictures employees and their families e-mails between employees information about executive salaries at the company copies of unreleased Sony films and other information The hackers called themselves the Guardians of Peace or GOP and demanded the cancellation of the planned release of the film The Interview a comedy about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un United States intelligence officials evaluating the software techniques and network sources used in the hack allege that the attack was sponsored by North Korea North Korea has denied all responsibility and some cybersecurity experts have cast doubt on the evidence alternatively proposing that current or former Sony Pictures employees may have been involved in the hack
Hack and perpetrators
The duration of the hack is yet unknown though evidence suggests that the intrusion had been occurring for more than a year prior to its discovery in November 2014 The hackers involved claim to have taken over 100 terabytes of data from Sony Following the breach the hackers implanted Wiper on Sony's computer infrastructure a malware software program designed to erase data from the servers The malware also led to the discovery of the hack in late November 2014 as many Sony employees computers were rendered inoperable by the software with the warning by the Guardians of Peace and several Sony-related Twitter accounts were also taken over
The Guardians of Peace GOP have made various threats relating to terrorism and the September 11 attacks that have drawn the attention of U.S security agencies North Korean state-sponsored hackers are suspected by the United States of being involved in part due to specific threats made toward Sony and movie theaters showing The Interview a comedy film about an assassination attempt against Kim Jong-un North Korean officials had previously expressed concerns about the film to the United Nations stating that to allow the production and distribution of such a film on the assassination of an incumbent head of a sovereign state should be regarded as the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war
Information obtained
According to a notice letter dated December 8 2014 from SPE to its employees SPE learned on December 1 2014 that personally identifiable information about employees and their dependents may have been obtained by unauthorized individuals as a result of a brazen cyber-attack including names address social security numbers and financial information On December 7 2014 C-SPAN reported that the hackers stole 47,000 unique Social Security numbers from the SPE computer network
Although personal data may have been stolen early news reports focused mainly on celebrity gossip and embarrassing details about Hollywood and film industry business affairs gleaned by the media from electronic files including private email messages released by the computer criminals Among the information revealed in the e-mails was that Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai pressured Sony Pictures co-chairwoman Amy Pascal to soften the assassination scene in the upcoming Sony film The Interview
Other e-mails released in the hack showed Pascal and Scott Rudin discussing Angelina Jolie and the fact that she wanted David Fincher to direct her film Cleopatra In the e-mails Rudin referred to Jolie as a minimally talented spoiled brat and said he did not want her getting involved with a planned film about Steve Jobs Pascal and Rudin were also noted to have had an e-mail exchange about Pascal's upcoming encounter with President Barack Obama that included characterizations described as racist The two had suggested they should mention films about African-Americans upon meeting the president such as Django Unchained 12 Years a Slave and The Butler all of which depict slavery in the United States or the pre-civil rights era Pascal and Rudin later apologized Details of lobbying efforts by politician Mike Moore on behalf of the Digital Citizens Alliance and FairSearch against Google were also revealed
The leak revealed multiple details of behind-the-scenes politics on Columbia Pictures current Spider-Man film series including e-mails between Pascal and others to various heads of Marvel Studios In addition to the emails a copy of the script for the upcoming James Bond film Spectre which is due to be released in 2015 was obtained Several future Sony Pictures films including Annie Mr Turner Still Alice and To Write Love on Her Arms were also leaked The hackers intended to release additional information on December 25 2014 which coincided with the originally planned release date of The Interview in the United States
In December 2014 former Sony Pictures Entertainment employees filed four lawsuits against the company for not protecting their data that was released in the hack which included Social Security numbers and medical information
In January 2015 details were revealed of the MPAA's lobbying of the United States International Trade Commission to mandate US ISPs either at the internet transit level or consumer level internet service provider to implement IP address blocking pirate websites as well as linking websites
Threats surrounding The Interview
On December 16 for the first time since the hack the Guardians of Peace mentioned the then-upcoming film The Interview by name and threatened to take terrorist actions against the film's New York City premiere at Sunshine Cinema on December 18 as well as on its American wide release date set for December 25 Sony pulled the theatrical release the following day
Seth Rogen and James Franco the stars of The Interview responded by saying they did not know if it was definitely caused by the film but later cancelled all media appearances tied to the film outside of the planned New York City premiere on December 16 2014 Following initial threats made towards theaters that would show The Interview several theatrical chains including Carmike Cinemas Bow Tie Cinemas Regal Entertainment Group AMC Theatres and Cinemark Theatres announced that they would not screen The Interview The same day Sony stated that they would allow theaters to opt out of showing The Interview but later decided to fully pull the national December 25 release of the film as well as announce that there were no further release plans to release the film on any platform including home video in the foreseeable future
On December 18 two messages both allegedly from the Guardians of Peace were released One sent in a private message to Sony executives stated that they would not release any further information if Sony never releases the film and removed its presence from the internet The other posted to Pastebin a web application used for text storage that the Guardians of Peace have used for previous messages stated that the studio had suffered enough and could release The Interview but only if Kim Jong-un's death scene was not too happy The post also stated that the company cannot test again and that if Sony Pictures makes anything else will be here ready to fight
President Barack Obama in an end-of-year press speech on December 19 commented on the Sony hacking and stated that he felt Sony made a mistake in pulling the film and that producers should not get into a pattern where you are intimidated by these acts He also said We will respond proportionally and we will respond in a place and time and manner that we choose In response to President Obama's statement Sony Entertainment's CEO Michael Lynton said on the CNN talk show Anderson Cooper 360 that the public the press and the President misunderstood the events Lynton said that the decision to cancel the wide release was in response to a majority of theaters pulling their showings and not to the hackers threats Lynton stated that they will seek other options to distribute the film in the future and noted We have not given in And we have not backed down We have always had every desire to have the American public see this movie
On December 23 Sony opted to authorize approximately 300 mostly-independent theaters to show The Interview on Christmas Day as the four major theater chains had yet to change their earlier decision not to show the film The FBI worked with these theaters to detail the specifics of the prior threats and how to manage security for the showings but noted that there was no actionable intelligence on the prior threats Sony's Lynton stated on the announcement that we are proud to make it available to the public and to have stood up to those who attempted to suppress free speech The Interview was also released to Google Play Xbox Video and YouTube on December 24 No incidents predicated by the threats occurred with the release and instead the unorthodox release of the film led to it being considered a success due to increased interest in the film following the attention it had received
On December 27 the North Korean National Defence Commission released a statement accusing Obama of being the chief culprit who forced the Sony Pictures Entertainment to indiscriminately distribute the movie Obama always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest
U.S accusations towards North Korea
U.S government officials stated on December 17 2014 their belief that the North Korean government was centrally involved in the hacking however there was some early debate within the White House over whether to publicly accuse North Korea White House officials are treating the situation as a serious national security matter The Federal Bureau of Investigations FBI formally stated on December 19 that they have connected the North Korean government to the cyber-attacks Including undisclosed evidence these claims were made based on the use of similar malicious hacking tools and techniques previously employed by North Korean hackers?including the Bureau 121 on South Korean targets According to the FBI
The FBI later clarified more details of the attacks and attributing them to North Korea by noting that the hackers were sloppy with the use of proxy IP addresses that originated from North Korea FBI Director James Comey stated that Internet access is tightly controlled within North Korea and as such it was unlikely that a third party had hijacked these addresses without allowance from the North Korean government The National Security Agency assisted the FBI in analyzing the attack specifically in reviewing the malware and tracing its origins NSA director Admiral Michael Rogers agreed with the FBI that the attack originated from North Korea
The North Korean news agency KCNA denied the wild rumours of North Korean involvement but said that The hacking into the SONY Pictures might be a righteous deed of the supporters and sympathizers with the DPRK in response to its appeal North Korea offered to be part of a joint probe with the United States to determine the hackers identities threatening consequences if the United States refused to collaborate and continued the allegation The U.S refused and asked China for investigative assistance instead Some days after the FBI's announcement North Korea temporarily suffered a nationwide Internet outage which the country claimed to be the United States response to the hacking attempts
On the day following the FBI's accusation of North Korea's involvement the FBI received an e-mail purportedly from the hacking group linking to a YouTube video entitled you are an idiot apparently mocking the organization
On December 19 2014 U.S Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson released a statement saying The cyber attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment was not just an attack against a company and its employees It was also an attack on our freedom of expression and way of life He encouraged businesses and other organizations to use the Cybersecurity Framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST to assess and limit cyber risks and protect against cyber threats On the same day U.S Secretary of State John Kerry published his remarks condemning North Korea for the cyber-attack and threats against movie theatres and moviegoers This provocative and unprecedented attack and subsequent threats only strengthen our resolve to continue to work with partners around the world to strengthen cybersecurity promote norms of acceptable state behavior uphold freedom of expression and ensure that the Internet remains open interoperable secure and reliable said he
On January 2 2015 the U.S installed additional economic sanctions on already-sanctioned North Korea for the hack which North Korean officials called out as groundlessly stirring up bad blood towards the country
Doubts about accusations toward North Korea
Members of the press and various cybersecurity experts have expressed doubt on the claims that North Korea was behind the hacking Cyber security experts independently analyzing the hack separately from the FBI?including Kurt Stammberger from cyber security firm Norse DEFCON organizer and Cloudflare researcher Marc Rogers Sabu and Kim Zetter a security journalist at Wired Magazine?have tended to agree that North Korea was not behind the attack
Michael Hiltzik Los Angeles Times journalist said that all evidence against North Korea has been circumstantial and that some cybersecurity experts have been skeptical about accusations against the government Cybersecurity expert Lucas Zaichkowsky said State-sponsored attackers don't create cool names for themselves like Guardians of Peace and promote their activity to the public Kim Zetter of Wired magazine called released evidence against the government flimsy Former hacker Hector Xavier Monsegur who once hacked into Sony explained to CBS News that exfiltrating one or one hundred terabytes of data would have taken months or years not weeks without anyone noticing Moreover Monsegur doubted the accusations due to North Korea's possibly insufficient infrastructure to handle much data He believed that it could have been either Chinese Russian or anyone else
Stammberger provided Norse's findings to the FBI that postulates the hack was an inside job stating Sony was not just hacked this is a company that was essentially nuked from the inside We are very confident that this was not an attack master-minded by North Korea and that insiders were key to the implementation of one of the most devastating attacks in history Stammberger believes that the security failure may have originated from six former disgruntled Sony employees based on their past skillsets and discussions these people made in chat rooms Norse employees identified these people from a list of workers that were eliminated from Sony during a restructuring in May 2014 and noted that some had made very public and angry responses to their firing and would be in appropriate positions to identify the means to access secure parts of Sony's servers After a private briefing lasting three hours the FBI formally rejected Norse's alternative assessment
Reactions
In December 2014 Sony requested that the media stop covering the hack Sony also threatened legal action if the media did not comply but according to law professor Eugene Volokh Sony's legal threats are unlikely to prevail Sony then threatened legal action against Twitter if it did not suspend accounts of people who posted the hacked material American screenwriter Aaron Sorkin wrote an op-ed for The New York Times opining that the media was helping the hackers by publishing and reporting on the leaked information On the 18th of December Reddit took the unusual step of banning a sub reddit SonyGOP that was being used to distribute the hacked files
The threats made directly at Sony over The Interview was seen by many as a threat on free speech The decision to pull the film was criticized by several Hollywood filmmakers and actors including Ben Stiller Steve Carell Rob Lowe Jimmy Kimmel and Judd Apatow Some commentators contrasted the situation to the non-controversial release of the 2004 a film that mocked the leadership of North Korea's prior leader Kim Jong-il The Alamo Drafthouse was poised to replace showings of The Interview with Team America until the film's distributor Paramount Pictures ordered the theaters to stop
In light of the threats made to Sony over The Interview New Regency cancelled its March 2015 production plans for a film adaption of the Pyongyang graphic novels which was set to star Steve Carell Hustler announced its intentions to make a pornographic parody film of The Interview Hustler founder Larry Flynt said If Kim Jong-un and his henchmen were upset before wait till they see the movie we're going to make
In China the media coverage of the hackings has been limited including in search engines except Google which has given out 36 million results Hua Chunying a spokeswoman of foreign affairs shied away from directly addressing the Sony hacking situation On December 25 2014 Russia offered sympathy to North Korea saying it was quite understandable that North Korea would be upset over the film Russia said American threats of retaliation were counterproductive and dangerous and that the US did not provide any proof of who hacked Sony


Exchange code protection

In telephony central office code protection or exchange code protection is a numbering policy intended to ensure that the same local telephone number is not assigned in both of a pair of adjacent communities on opposite sides of a telephone area code boundary It is most commonly used to preserve seven-digit dialling in border communities in the North American Numbering Plan
Central office CO code protection was once common in communities such as Ottawa-Hull or Washington D.C which were constructed on provincial or state boundary lines It is declining in use as inefficient allocation of numbering resources to the growing number of competitive local exchange carriers has caused depletion of available number prefixes often requiring ten-digit local calls or overlay plans where multiple area codes serve the same geographic location
Operation
In the North American Numbering Plan telephone numbers are allocated to individual communities as blocks of 10000 consecutive numbers each block is identified by +1 - area code 3 digits - exchange code 3 digits The remaining four digits identify a specific local number within the exchange These blocks may then be split between multiple local providers or assigned directly to individual local telephone companies
As an example the entire +1-506-752- prefix is assigned to Aliant Telecom NB and serves Campobello Island New Brunswick Campobello is a border community and is a local call to Lubec Maine in area code 207
The +1-207-733- prefix serves Lubec split between FairPoint Communications and a pair of competitors using number pooling Both area code 506 and 207 use seven digits for local calls
A seven-digit local call from Campobello to Lubec is possible provided that 733-XXXX is not assigned to anything in the 506 area code which is local anywhere near Campobello This may be done in one of two ways
Similarly Edmundston is local to Madawaska Maine exchanges +1-207-316 +1-207-436 and +1-207-728 The corresponding +1-506-316 +1-506-436 and +1-506-728 prefixes as of 2014 are not issued by the Canadian Numbering Administrator CNAC
A few small towns on US state boundaries have one central office which serves both sides using different prefixes in different area codes All South Coffeyville Oklahoma exchange prefixes are served from Coffeyville Kansas population 10000 the two are local to each other but long distance to everything else
Limitations
If code protection is implemented by reserving every seven-digit number for a border town in both or all of the affected area codes that community and points in its local calling area occupy numbering resources at double the otherwise-expected rate This is a minor drawback in small cities such as Lloydminster but can consume numbers rapidly in larger centres such as St Louis or Kansas City
In large cities located directly on area code boundaries such as Ottawa-Hull in 613/819 the fourth-largest Canadian metropolitan area this can lead to a situation where none of the many vacant prefixes are assignable to a city without breaking seven-digit calling across the area code boundary Code protection in Ottawa-Hull broke down in 2006 for this reason The 1-819 versions of Ottawa 1-613 numbers were reserved and made unavailable to anyone instead of being assigned out-of-region so eventually the few remaining 1-819 prefixes could not be assigned without requiring ten-digit dialling from Ottawa to Hull Similarly seven-digit calling between Washington D.C and its suburbs broke down in 1991
A local calling area spanning three US states such as Sioux City Iowa extending into North Sioux City South Dakota and South Sioux City Nebraska would require any number local to any part of the town to be reserved in all three area codes
Even if a city is not directly on an area code boundary it may require code protection if a suburb in its local calling area can call another area code locally Chicago is long distance to Indiana but Calumet City Illinois is local to both Chicago Illinois and East Chicago Indiana A dial plan which uses purely seven-digit local calling from Calumet City would protect a massive number of Chicago 312 numbers from assignment in Indiana's area code 219 forcing that code to split from central Indiana's 317 in the first year 1948 after the original area codes were assigned 1947
Severing the border community from its exhausted home area code using a split plan may prolong the life of a seven-digit exchange code protection scheme if the piece being split off is outside the extended local calling area Code protection is most often removed entirely in large cities if an overlay plan is implemented as these plans break the seven-digit dialling that code protection was devised to preserve The plan also can be expected to break down if new split-plan codes are added within a Chicago-sized city as the city itself no longer fits into one seven-digit area

Rajkumar Keswani

Raajkumar Keswani born Bhopal India is a senior journalist Keswani was the first journalist to bring attention to the safety lapses and impending Bhopal disaster that eventually came to pass at the town's Union Carbide pesticides plant over night on December 2-3 1984 Keswani had written several articles from 1982 through 1984 detailing that safety standards at the plant were inadequate and that a catastrophic leak could result
Rajkumar began to take an interest in the affairs of the Union Carbide Bhopal India plant in 1981 when Mohammad Ashraf his friend who also was a plant employee spoke of possible dangers posed by leaks and died in an accident at the plant on 24 December 1981 after inhaling phosgene For internal information sources Rajkumar found two persons who were fired - Bashirullah and Shankar Malvia who helped him to get hold of all manuals and confidential reports it took rajkumar nine months to write his first piece in 1982
Raising alarm about the Disaster
Reports of Safety lapses in the plant had started surfacing in 1981 three years before the disaster when a minor gas leak killed an employee inside the plant Rajkumar first wrote about inadequate safety standards on Sept 26 1982 with a title Åg Save Please This CityÅh in a small weekly paper Rapat He repeated the warning in two follow-up articles on Oct 1- Bhopal sitting on the brink of a volcano and on Oct 8-ÅeIf you donÅft understand all will endÅf that year On Oct 5 four days after the second article 18 people at the Union Carbide plant were exposed to a mixture of chloroform methyl isocyanate and hydrochloric acid from a leaking valve None was seriously harmed In the article Bhopal On the Brink of a DisasterÅh
Rajkumar reported on a series of incidents that had taken place and asserted that the leak on Oct 5 1982 had affected thousands of residents of neighboring slum districts who fled in fear and returned only after eight hours Request to Move Plant Cited Rajkumar also asserted in the article that in 1975 M N Buch an Indian bureaucrat had asked Union Carbide to move the plant away from its present site because of the rapid growth of residential neighborhoods around it Union carbide were lucky because Mr Buch was transferred from his post
Rajkumar reported a Telex exchange about Union carbide India works manager named J Mukund one of the accused who was convicted on June 7 sent asking for advice about coating the pipes and the US-based parent company sent him a message saying that the best material for piping would be too expensive and too difficult to acquire and highlighting how Union Carbide USA escape their responsibility when they were advising Bhopal to economise on safety measures and instructed Bhopal to use cheaper material They were advising it to compromise on safety Mukund's message was sent on August 27 1984 Just a few weeks before the fateful leak
Rajkumar a journalist not an engineer,knew nothing about the composition of chemicals or their behaviour His conviction that the Union Carbide Bhopal plant was headed for disaster grew out of two small pieces of information that he happened to read independently One was in a Union Carbide report that mentioned in passing that several of the gasses that MIC broke down into such as phosgene were Ågheavier than air.Åh Reference to phosgene caught his eye while reading an article on WWII it had been one of the chemicals used in the German gas chambers With these two incidental pieces of information Rajkumar launched an investigation that convinced him that Bhopal was on the road to certain tragedy.In spite of the shrillness of his warnings no one paid him any attention Even his friends thought he was crazy
Life after the Disaster
Post the disaster Rajkumar was interviewed on radio and television shows as he was the only journalist who knew anything about the Union Carbide Bhopal plant He was called a ÅgCassandraÅh and a Åglone voice in the wildernessÅh Rajkumar became the youngest person ever to receive the prestigious Indian PTI Press Trust of India Award for Excellence in Journalism In his acceptance speech Rajkumar noted that he might also be the first to receive the award for such a spectacular journalistic failure had he succeed at his task no one would have ever taken noteÅh
Rajkumar also received the Madhav Rao Sapre PuraskarÅf award 2008 Prem Bhatia Award 2010 for Outstanding Environmental Reporting

Rooster Andrews

William Edward Rooster Andrews Jr was a former University of Texas team manager who gained fame as a drop-kicking player whom the media called the All-American Waterboy He later opened a sporting goods store and in that capacity developed the university's iconic Longhorn logo and changed the uniform color to burnt orange He was also the older brother of Texas starting quarterback John Bunny Andrews
Early life
William Rooster Jr was born in Dallas TX where his father worked in the pursing office of Texas Pacific Railways
As a 17-year-old at Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas Andrews participated in the 1936 Texas state championship track meet as the school's manager There he met legendary Texas track coach Clyde Littlefield who put Andrews to work setting up for the Texas Relays Andrews ended up staying three extra days to work even after the track team left on the bus for Dallas For this he was paid $9 Malcolm Kutner a classmate of Andrews asked Texas football coach Dana X Bible to bring Andrews on as a team manager but said that Andrews would need a job Texas A&M coach Homer Norton also wanted Andrews as a manager and even sent him a dorm room key But the night before Andrews was to leave for Texas A&M Andrews classmate called to tell him that Bible had found him a job through the National Youth Administration so Andrews headed to Austin instead

The nickname All-America Waterboy came not from his play on the field but from serving as manager in college postseason games the 1941 East-West Shrine game and College All-Star games in Chicago every year from 1942 to 1946 The nickname Rooster came from a college incident in which Andrews broke an arm trying to retrieve a chicken from a tree
Longhorn Logo and Burnt Orange
In 1961 coach Darrell Royal talked to Andrews about ways to improve the Longhorns uniform Back then the Longhorns helmets were white with orange numerals on the side and a thin orange stripe down the center Andrews told Royal he had an idea and would work on it that night He found a Longhorn head in a book traced it and colored it in with crayon and then found a distributor to make decals of the logo They were added onto the helmets of the 1961 Longhorn football team and have remained there ever since In 2013 Athlon Sports named the steerhead logo that Andrews developed as the nation's best college football logo
One year later Royal and Andrews worked together to change the uniform color from the bright orange that was then used to the burnt orange in use today Royal wanted the color to be darker closer to the color of the football the way the practice uniforms looked when they were stained with sweat after a hot hard practice Andrews soaked a uniform in water and showed it to a manufacturer who was then able to make uniforms with the burnt orange color
Later life
In 1946 Andrews turned down an offer to be a manager with the Miami Seahawks of the All-American Football Conference to become a salesman for a C&S Sporting Goods The self-described jockstrap peddler later became president of the company from 1961-69 In 1969 he along with his brother Bunny moved to the Texas Sporting Goods Company becoming a Vice-President and manager of the Austin store In 1971 he opened the first of his own sporting goods stores in Austin At its peak Rooster Andrews Sporting Goods had four retail locations across Austin an annual sales volume of $5 million and employed more than 70 people Andrews married his high school sweetheart and had three kids He was an active member of the community serving on boards and as presidents of many Austin civic organizations including the Optimist Club and the Travis County Grand Jury

Spanish Hill

Spanish Hill is a landform in the town of South Waverly Bradford County Pennsylvania United States The hill is controversial among historians and archaeologists opinions regarding the origin of structures found on the site vary from embankments created by early farmers to the remnants Native American village and battlements due to the site's similarity to the description found in the account of Etienne Brule of a settlement called Carantouan The area was previously occupied by Susquehannock Native Americans It was a common site for both amateur and professional archaeology as well as relic hunting The source of the name remains unknown but various theories have been proposed as to its origin
History
Spanish Hill is located in South Waverly Pennsylvania inside Bradford County just south of the state border with New York Occupying a site that was formerly home to portions of the Susquehannock people the hill has been acknowledged and studied by historians and archaeologists for over two hundred years The source of the name is unknown but individuals traveling through the area between 1795 and 1804 described Spanish Ramparts as a feature of the hill and some of the earliest settlers to the region report that local Native Americans referred to the hill either as Hispan or Espan In 1615 Etienne Brule was sent to the area by Samuel de Champlain to meet with Native American tribes in the hope of finding assistance to fight the Iroquois against whom Champlain had allied with the Wyandot people During his voyage Brule recorded a town called Carantouan meaning Big Tree according to ethnologist William Martin Beauchamp which was subsequently included on a map published by de Champlain in 1632 In the early nineteenth-century a Native American man who lived in the area near Spanish Hill reportedly refused to ascend it for fear of a deadly spirit that lived on top According to the man the spirit spoke with a thunderous voice and made holes through Indians bodies Archaeologist Louise Welles Murray suggested that this could be a reference to cannon or musket fire
In the early twentieth-century archaeological and historical research was conducted regarding a potential connection between Carantouan and the structures described on the hill After surveying the area in spring and fall archaeologist L.D Shoemaker discovered evidence of Native American habitation including shell heaps corn and flint chips along with various other implements Speculation that Spanish Hill was the site of Carantouan was countered by James Bennett Griffin who found nothing of interest in the area following an archaeological survey in 1931 However historian Deb Twigg suggests that prior excavations conducted by early twentieth-century archaeologist Warren Moorehead as well as years of heavy farming activity in the area may have contributed to the lack of artifacts found during the Griffin expedition
the site was a popular location both for archaeological excavations and amateur collecting According to Twigg Spanish Hill was looted by Moorehead and his finds likely sold to collectors In addition the area was heavily scoured by relic collectors approximately since the early nineteenth-century
On October 15 1915 the Historical Society of Bradford County Pennsylvania dedicated a memorial on Spanish Hill in honor of the tricentennial of the arrival of Brule to the present-day border of Pennsylvania Later in 1939 Section of Painting and Sculpture artist Musa McKim depicted the hill in a mural entitled Spanish Hill and the Early Inhabitants of the Vicinity for display in the United States Post Office branch of nearby Waverly New York
Features
Originally created by receding glaciers Spanish Hill comprises approximately of earth that rises approximately above the floodplain of the Chemung River which is located nearby
A traveler reaching the site in 1795 described the hill as a mountain in the shape of a sugar loaf about 100 feet high with level top on which are remains of intrenchments One perpendicular breastwork is still remaining plainly indicating a parapet and ditch In 1833 another individual visiting the hill described the remains of a wall which runs around the whole exactly on the brow and within a deep ditch or intrenchment running round the whole summit In 1898 I.P Shepard created a sketch of Spanish Hill including the portions still visible at the time as well as those no longer extant Shepard enlisted the assistance of a longtime local resident Charles Henry Shepard who claimed to remember fortifications as consisting of an embankment with a trench behind giving a height of four or five feet on the inside In addition an indent was discovered on the site which was pronounced to be a corn cache by Beauchamp
According to John S Clark a surveyor and historian active in the area until the early twentieth-century the topography and size of the site were appropriate to correspond with Brule's description of Carantouan Brule described a palisaded town populated by approximately 800 warriors and 4,000 individuals in total He also described the dwellings and fortifications as being similar to those utilized by the Wyandot people Clark based his opinions on antique maps as well as a survey of the area that he conducted in 1878 during which he also noted what appeared to be gateway bastions Amateur archaeologist Ellsworth C Cowles conducted an excavation at the base of the hill in 1932 uncovering what he described as seventy five postholes extending east and west as well as the effigy of a huge animal


Heugh lighthouse

The Heugh lighthouse is a navigation light on The Headland in Hartlepool in north-east England The current lighthouse dates from 1927 it is owned and operated by PD Ports Its early-Victorian predecessor is believed to have been the first gas-lit lighthouse in the world
History
Following the establishment of the Hartlepool Dock & Railway company West Hartlepool quickly grew into a sizeable coal port on the Durham coast In 1844 mariners tasked with navigating their way into the new docks had expressed concern about the inadequate provision of lights on this dangerous stretch of rocky coastline and in 1846 the Corporation of Trinity House instructed the harbour authority to make necessary provision
1847-1915 the first light on The Heugh
A lighthouse was promptly built in sandstone a tapering cylindrical tower high It was first lit on 1st October 1847 fuelled by natural gas from one of the local coal mines The main light was visible for 18 miles out to sea
The old light's demise came about as an indirect result of the German raid on Hartlepool in December 1914 The lighthouse itself was unscathed though several nearby buildings received severe damage but it was realised that the tower obstructed the line of fire of the defensive guns of the Headland batteries It was therefore dismantled in 1915
1915-1927 temporary light on the Town Moor
As a temporary measure the light lantern and lens from the Heugh lighthouse were instead mounted on a wooden lattice structure on the nearby town moor They remained here until the erection of the new Heugh light in 1927 When the structure was dismantled the optic lenses and light array were saved they are now on display in the Museum of Hartlepool
1927 onwards the current lighthouse
The current lighthouse of a prefabricated steel construction is a white-painted cylindrical tower high Built not far from the site of the first lighthouse though without obstructing the line of fire of the guns it was designed to be able to be dismantled in the event of war so as not to provide a landmark for enemy gunsights It was from the start electrically-powered and fully automated
Present-day operation
The lighthouse is still in use today under the management of the local port authority It displays a white light flashing twice every ten seconds One of the adjacent buildings housed a nautophone fog signal which used to sound three 3-second blasts every 45 seconds The other building houses radio equipment for HM Coastguard
Other nearby lighthouses
Nearby Seaton Carew had a pair of lighthouses for many years They were decommissioned in the late nineteenth century years later one of the two was re-erected in Hartlepool Marina as a mariners memorial
South Gare Lighthouse stands on a pier head at the opposite end of the bay to the Heugh marking the southern approach to the River Tees
Just south-west of the Heugh the Old or Pilots Pier has been marked by a lighthouse since 1836 The present wooden structure painted white with two narrow red horizontal stripes dates from 1899 the lantern is strikingly topped by a rotating radar It displays a green light one flash every three seconds with a white sector indicating the deep-water channel into the Old Harbour and Hartlepool Docks

Tropidolaemus laticinctus

Tropidolaemus laticinctus is a venomous pit viper species native to Indonesia
Etymology
The specific epithet the Latin adjective laticinctus meaning broad-ringed or broad-banded alludes to the color pattern on the body of the new species which consists of comparatively broad brick-red to brown rings and readily distinguishes it from sympatric congeners with very narrow blue or red spots or bands on an otherwise solid bright green dorsum as well as from any other known member of the genus Tropidolaemus
Description
A species of Tropidolaemus an Asian pitviper genus characterized by strongly keeled gular scales a splenial that is separate from the angular Burger 1971 and a unique dorsal scale microdermatoglyphic pattern of rounded cells that are strongly covered with longitudinal parallel lines and comb-like ridges Hoge & Romano-Hoge 1983 striocristate pattern subtype sensu Price 1982 verified in ZMB 47809 Tropidolaemus laticinctus differs from all congeners by the following combination of characters lack of pronounced sexual or ontogenetic differences in color pattern presence of ornate head pattern with brown dorsalmarkings on green ground that are bordered by cream scales and are largest on the posterior head wide brown pre- and postocular stripe that extends to lower side of head beyond angle of jaw ornate labial pattern consisting of brown spots bordered by white or black on green to cream ground color conspicuous large brown spot extending from anteroventral corner of eye and posteroventral margin of pit to lower margin of supra labials lower side of head with similar pattern as dorsal side of head or mottled with numerous brown and black spots and streaks dorsal body pattern consisting of broad brick-red to brown rings that may be incomplete dorsally or laterally and are about as wide as or wider than the cream to white interspaces anterodorsal part of light interspaces of body pattern containing wide green bands brown rings across belly connected midventrally to form midventral stripe if brown rings incomplete ventrally venter heavily spotted with chessboard-like pattern base of tail with whitish and brown rings tip of tail lighter reddish brown with no or only indistinct bands Unlike other temple viper species this species lacks age-related and sexually dimorphic coloration
Geographic range
Tropidolaemus laticinctus is endemic to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi and is known to occur in the northern and central provinces of that island Sulawesi Utara and Sulawesi Tengah respectively and possibly the southern province Sulawesi Selatan
Habitat
This species inhabits humid lowland to hill rainforest on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi up to elevations of at least 550 meters


Niebla marinii

Niebla marinii is a fruticose lichen that grows on lava along the Pacific Coast of Baja California from near San Fernando Canyon south to Morro Santo Domingo The epithet marinii is in honor of a field assistant Richard Marin who accompanied the author on lichen collecting expeditions to Baja California during 1985?1996 while he also assisted in the gathering of samples of flowering plants for cancer research
Distinguishing Features
Niebla marinii is distinguished by the thallus divided into linear-subterete or linear-prismatic branches from a common attachment base or holdfast the primary branches often tubular inflated near base with a glossy smooth cortex dividing frequently into equal secondary branches above the branches wide spreading arcuate or horseshoe shaped densely tangled together terminally flexuous or whip-like the whole thallus to 15?cm in diameter and 6?cm high The species N marinii also recognized by containing salazinic acid without triterpenes but often with an unknown possibly scabrosin derivative Pycnidia are prominent at tips of branches and on the upper parts of branches Niebla josecuervoi is similar differing in the numerous short spine-like branchlets along the upper side of primary branches the branches appearing comb-like
Niebla marinii"?consistent in its morphological features at specific locations but variable in cortical features when viewed collectively from all locations?may possibly comprise two species one of which has distinctly raised cortical ridges This may be a hybrid with Niebla siphonoloba Evidence for hybridization is seen by the same morphological variation in another species one that has the bushy habit and smooth cortex of N marinii Niebla suffnessii as found at its type locality?Cerro Elefante on the Vizcaino Peninsula Approximately 200 miles north of Cerro Elefante?which is about half way up the northern Baja peninsula and just north of Punta Canoas?are both N marinii and N suffnessii that occur together on Mesa Camacho?a red lava mesa 300?400 m in elevation At this location the thalli of both species have conspicuously raised sinuous short wavy cortical ridges proposed species names have been suggested one for the salazinic acid species the other for the sekikaic acid species Although the same species of Niebla can vary in a particular feature such as in its cortical ridge patterns it may also retain other morphological and chemical taxonomic features at different locations in this case Niebla marinii has the wide angle branching horseshoe-shaped branchlets and prominent pycnidia at both locations whereas N suffnessii has inconspicuous pycnidia and long drawn-out branches at both locations
Sinuous cortical ridges are generally characteristic of the sekikaic-acid species Niebla siphonoloba throughout its geographical range and it occurs frequently on Mesa Camacho This species N siphonoloba is recognized by its simple stubby branches in addition to having sekikaic acid and a prominent reticulated honeycomb-like cortex A logical explanation for the occurrence of the distinct cortical sinuous ridges in N marinii and N suffnessii on Mesa Camacho is hybridization which in lichens is rarely mentioned and when it is it usually is in context with chemical variation or vegetative diasporas such as soredia and isidia isidium In Niebla the chemical features are believed to be genetically conserved and closely linked to morphological features for each species while less genetically linked features are suggested to be easily exchanged As a further example in the Channel Islands Santa Cruz Island N siphonoloba is suspected to hybridize with another sekikaic-acid species Niebla fimbriata as seen by their intermediates The morphological variation in Niebla marinii N suffnessii and N siphonoloba are just a few examples of the broad spectrum of morphological variation that can be found in each species referred as morpho-syndrome variation in contrast to chemo-syndromes recognized in the related genus Ramalina Morpho-syndrome variation generally has not been recognized in lichens because it would seem that environmentally induced variation is considered a more likely explanation
Taxonomic History
Niebla marinii was first recognized from thalli collected at Morro Santo Domingo a peninsula 22 miles north of Guerrero Negro type specimen Spjut 9783 collected 18 May 1986 towards a lichen flora of Baja California It was the dominant fruticose lichen on red lava A common associated species was Niebla lobulata also its type locality
Niebla marinii has been included under a very broad species concept Niebla josecuervoi one that essentially recognizes only three species in the genus Niebla defined by a two-layered cortex isolated chondroid strands in the medulla and by the lichen substances lacking the terpenes found in Vermilacinia Under the broad species concept the morphological differences are seen as environmentally induced variation and the chemical differences e.g N pulchribarbara protocetraric acid are viewed as belonging to a chemo-syndrome however no data was presented to support this view other than reference to studies in other genera in which the species differences mentioned were not applicable

Cuban Thaw

The Cuban Thaw is a historic warming of U.S.-Cuba relations which was announced suddenly around mid-December 2014
On December 17 2014 U.S President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced the beginning of a process of normalizing relations between Cuba and the United States Negotiated in secret in Canada and Vatican City over preceding months and with the assistance of Pope Francis the agreement would see the lifting of some U.S travel restrictions fewer restrictions on remittances U.S banks access to the Cuban financial system and the reopening of embassies in Havana and Washington which closed in 1961 after the breakup of diplomatic relations following the establishment of CubaÅfs close alliance with the USSR
As far back as May 2012 it had been reported that the U.S had declined a spy swap proposed by the Cuban government wherein the remaining three of an original group of convicted Cuban spies known as the Cuban Five in prison in the U.S since the 1990s would be returned to Cuba in exchange for USAID contractor Alan Phillip Gross imprisoned in Cuba for illegally providing equipment allowing Cuban Jews to have internet access
The prisoner swap eventually took place in December 2014 as part of the Cuban Thaw In addition to Gross the swap included Rolando Sarraff Trujillo a Cuban who had worked as an agent for American intelligence and had been in a Cuban prison for nearly 20 years Additionally in early January 2015 the Cuban government began releasing a number of imprisoned dissidents as requested by the US it being reported that Cuba had released 26 by January 8 and at least 36 by January 9
The breakthrough has widely been referred to as the Cuban Thaw by media sources who have predicted that it will lead to a wide variety of social and economic benefits for the two countries Newsweek reported that the stock market jumped once elements of the Cuban thaw were reported Reuters reported that the Cuban thaw would make it more likely the Cuban government will extradite fugitives sought by U.S officials The New Zealand Herald reported environmentalist concerns that the Cuban thaw would lead to the opening of one of the most prolific oil and gas basins on the planet which sits off the coast of Cuba Bloomberg reported that the Cuban thaw would even benefit Major League Baseball with teams having major new opportunities to sign Cuban players
International reactions were mostly positive with Radio Poland having reported that the Foreign Ministry of Poland is encouraging Washington to go further by lifting a long-standing embargo But in Israel it was reported that the Israeli Foreign Ministry is miffed at having been caught off guard by the change and Israel was one of the few countries not to issue a statement welcoming the change
The Cuban Thaw has had some political consequences in the United States most highlighted by a published exchange of opposing assessments by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida who opposes the thaw and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky who supports the thaw

Eylul Cans?n

Eylul Cans?n 1992 to 5 January 2015 was a 23-year-old Turkish transgender woman that committed suicide by jumping off the Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul Turkey despite police's attempts to stop her She died on impact
Shortly before her death she posted a suicide note/video in Turkish to her Facebook account
Life
Eylul Cans?n was born in 1992 She died shortly before her twenty-fourth birthday She was laid to rest at the Ferikoy Cemetery Istanbul
She worked as a sex worker up until her death on 5 January 2015 a common occupation in Turkey - especially Istanbul - for LGBT people especially transgender women
Contents of the suicide note/video
In her suicide note/video she begins with Today is my most beautiful day IÅfm so happy Today is going to be another beautiful day for me
She goes on to explain that despite people being friendly to her she felt as though she had no friends This is due to the fact that the day before she committed suicide her friends physically attacked her violently
Eylul expresses how difficult life being transgender was and how could not because people did not allow her to work they interfered with a lot and victimized a lot.Åh
Eylul also tells her mother specifically that she wants her to take care of her pet dog saying as she cried ÅgMom I have a very small dog at home I know that you will take her in and that you will take good care of her Mom I entrust her to you Please think of me whenever you look at her Think of only me And donÅft give her away to any one.Åh
Reactions following her death
Protests in Turkey
Following Eylul Cans?n's suicide protests stating that her death was murder by society were held in several Turkish cities like Ankara Istanbul Izmir and Kocaeli
The protests brought light to Turkish police brutality and gang violence directed towards trans sex workers They also brought up social issues such as the low employment ratings for transgender citizens Prostitution is legal in Turkey Transgender women are at the most risk to be swept into this dangerous business and are at a greater risk for sexually transmitted diseases STD or sexually transmitted infections STI and police brutality due to few protective rights of sex workers
The Media
Social media was outraged by her suicide and sparked more uproar for international LGBT equality in society
The Turkish Psychologists Association TPA expressed concern that Eylul's suicide would spark more suicides in Turkish LGBT youth They say that it is critical that detailed explanations of the death should be avoided as it often will become a role model for adolescents and young adults who are the most inclined to depression and suicidal actions

Stephen B Small

Stephen B Small 1947-1987 was a prominent businessman in Kankakee Illinois In 1987 he was kidnapped and held for ransom by Danny Edwards and Nancy Rish The conditions of his confinement caused him to die of asphyxiation As a result Edwards was given the death penalty later commuted and Rish was sentenced to life in prison without parole
Small Biography
Small was born and raised in Kankakee Illinois His parents Burrell and Reva Small owned and operated a media conglomerate called Mid America Media the Small family also owned the controlling interest in United Press International and this is where Small himself worked His great grandfather was Illinois governor Len Small Stephen Small had received his education at Lake Forest Academy the University of Denver and Mark Hopkins College In 1969 he married Nancy Pedersen with whom he had three sons
Kidnapping
Around 12:30?a.m on September 2 1987 someone claiming to be a Kankakee police officer called the Small home and told Stephen Small that a burglary had occurred at the Bradly House a property that Small owned and was in the process of renovating Small got dressed and left his home Around 3:30 that morning someone called the Small residence and told Stephen's wife Nancy We have your husband Nancy then heard her husband say that he had been handcuffed inside a box underground Small told his wife to obtain $1 million in cash The caller directed Mrs Small not to report the matter to the police
The matter was reported to the authorities however and devices were connected to the Smalls telephone line to record incoming calls and to determine their origins At 5:03 that afternoon the same person called again asking Mrs Small how much money had been collected This call was placed from a telephone located at a Phillips 66 gas station in Aroma Park Edwards was seen there at that time in the company of a blonde-haired woman
At 5:40?p.m Jean Alice Small Stephen Small's aunt telephoned the Small residence to tell them of a call she had just received Jean said that the caller had told her that he knew that Nancy Small's telephone was tapped After telling Jean that the victim was buried the caller threatened to kill Jean's husband Nancy Small received another telephone call from the kidnapper at 11:28 that night This call originated from a telephone at a Sunoco station in Aroma Park where an FBI agent saw a white male at a telephone and a blonde-haired woman in a car that was later identified as belonging to Nancy Rish EdwardsÅf girlfriend Rish had blonde hair The caller played a tape recording of Stephen Small's voice On the tape Stephen provided instructions for delivering the ransom After audio enhancement a voice in the background could be heard threatening Small
Tracking and Arrest of Edwards and Rish
Nancy Small received one more telephone call from the kidnapper at 11:46 that night The call was placed from a Marathon service station in Kankakee The caller accused Nancy of having notified the police and refused her offer of the ransom Minutes later at 11:50?p.m an Illinois State Police officer saw Rish's car with its trunk partly open driving from Kankakee toward Aroma Park
Law enforcement officers then placed EdwardsÅf home under surveillance They saw a dark-colored Buick with its trunk partly open arrive at the house in Bourbonnais where Edwards and Rish lived Edwards and a white woman with blonde hair left the car and went inside
Officers carried out a search of the residence later that morning on September 3 Rish and Edwards were arrested at that time Later that day Edwards led law enforcement officers to the site where the victim was buried There officers dug up a wooden box and found the victim's body inside The box measured about six feet long and three feet wide and was constructed of plywood It contained a light connected to an automotive battery a one gallon jug of water candy bars gum and a flashlight
A medical examiner later determined that the victim died of asphyxiation caused by suffocation The medical examiner believed that the victim would not have survived more than three or four hours inside the enclosed box The medical examiner noted that the pipe extending from the box into the open air was too long for its diameter to serve as an adequate air-exchange system
Edwards Trial
The State presented other evidence connecting Edwards to these offenses On the night of the victim's disappearance around midnight a neighbor of Edwards heard Edwards say Let's go let's hit it get into his car and drive off Also two neighbors of the Small family saw EdwardsÅf van or one similar to it parked in their neighborhood after midnight on September 2 One neighbor also noticed a mid-sized car at that time heard two car doors slam and saw the car and EdwardsÅf van drive away with their lights off
Several witnesses saw Edwards constructing a wooden box in his garage during summer 1987 preceding the offenses here Edwards gave various explanations for the project saying that it would be used for a lemonade stand or by his brother for transporting things or at his brother's pool in Florida A neighbor of the Smalls had seen a white van similar to EdwardsÅf van driving through an alley next to the Small's home about 10 times that summer While Edwards and Rish were visiting a boat store that summer Edwards saw Stephen Small leaving the store in a sports car Edwards was heard to say Boy it sure would be nice to afford stuff like that
The search of Edwards's residence at the time of his arrest turned up a Kankakee telephone book with the name Small circled Edwards boots were found behind a washer and dryer at the residence and soil on the boots matched a sample from the location where the box was buried Soil in EdwardsÅf van also matched the sample White caulking material on gloves found in EdwardsÅf trash had the same chemical composition as the caulking material used to fill in the seams of the wooden box in which the victim had been buried Edwards fingerprints were found on PVC pipe and duct tape recovered from the box
A person who owed Edwards money had had a pair of handcuffs stolen from him and the same pair was later discovered on the victim Another person who owed Edwards money had had a gun stolen and it was found by investigators in the countryside near Aroma Park Edwards purchased a battery that was found in the wooden box Bolt cutters belonging to a company owned by EdwardsÅf brother were found at a point between where the box was uncovered and where the victim's car was found and they could have been the implement used to cut the chain connecting the handcuffs on the victim's wrists
Edwards Sentence

Nancy Rish
On September 2 1987 during the kidnapping and murder of Kankakee business man Stephen B Small the investigation focused on Danny Edwards and Nancy Rish who lived together in a townhouse in Bourbonnais
On September 4 a search warrant was executed for the townhouse That evening Edwards led the police to a rural area where Small's body was recovered It appeared that Small had been placed in a wooden box which had been fitted with a PVC pipe designed to give him air for 24 to 48 hours Small's wrists were handcuffed and the box was buried The coroner later determined that his death was caused by asphyxia due to suffocation
That same night the police arrested Rish and held her at the station for questioning Rish requested a specific attorney J Scott Swaim who had previously represented her and she was given an opportunity to obtain his counsel Rish did not know that Swaim was friends with the victim
For the next four days between September 4 and September 8 the police questioned Rish with counsel present Eight statements were elicited concerning her knowledge and actions in the early days of September None of the statements was totally consistent with any other
Rish Trial
On October 1 Rish was charged by indictment with first-degree murder and aggravated kidnapping for her alleged role in Small's death On November 2 1988 Rish was tried by a jury No direct evidence was presented linking her to the kidnapping or death of Small However the State was able to enter Rish's eight inconsistent statements into evidence Witnesses were also presented who testified that they had seen her at various times with Edwards when he was purchasing some of items that were ultimately found with Small's body Other witnesses reported that they had observed her at various related locations during the course of the kidnaping and ransom calls Lastly the State submitted evidence that Edwards had used their garage to build the box in which Small's body was found The jury found Rish guilty on both counts and the trial court sentenced her to a term of natural life imprisonment and a concurrent 30-year term
Ryan Commutation
On January 11 2003 Illinois Governor George Ryan a native of Kankakee commuted all death row sentences in Illinois to life imprisonment This act commuted the sentence of Danny Edwards who had murdered RyanÅfs next-door-neighbor Stephen Small This is what Ryan had to say about the Small case at the time of the commutation ÅgI grew up in Kankakee which even today is still a small midwestern town a place where people tend to know each other Steve Small was a neighbor I watched him grow up He would babysit my young children ? which was not for the faint of heart since Lura Lynn and I had six children five of them under the age of 3 He was a bright young man who helped run the family business He got married and he and his wife had three children of their own Lura Lynn was especially close to him and his family We took comfort in knowing he was there for us and we for him One September midnight he received a call at his home There had been a break-in at the nearby house he was renovating But as he left his house he was seized at gunpoint by kidnappers His captors buried him alive in a shallow hole He suffocated to death before police could find him His killer led investigators to where SteveÅfs body was buried The killer Danny Edwards was also from my hometown He now sits on death row I also know his family I share this story with you so that you know I do not come to this as a neophyte without having experienced a small bit of the bitter pill the survivors of murder must swallow My responsibilities and obligations are more than my neighbors and my family I represent all the people of Illinois ? like it or not The decision I make about our criminal justice system is felt not only here but the world over.Åh


Stand Up Stand Up for Jesus

Stand Up Stand Up for Jesus is an American Christian hymn It was written by George Duffield Jr in 1858 and is based on the dying words of Dudley Atkins Tyng The music was composed by George James Webb
History
In 1858 Presbyterian minister George Duffield Jr was an associate of Dudley Atkins Tyng who had recently been removed from his local Episcopalian community for speaking against slavery Duffield assisted Tyng in supporting a revival of evangelicalism in Pennsylvania In March 1858 Tyng gave a sermon at a YMCA meeting of over 5,000 men on Exodus 10:11 Go now ye that are men and serve the Lord converting over 1,000 men listening in the crowd The following month Tyng was maimed in a farming accident Before he died a few days after the accident he told his father Tell my brethren of the ministry wherever you meet them to stand up for Jesus Duffield then wrote the hymn based on those words and also incorporated the phrase Ye that are men now serve Him from Tyng's memorable sermon the month before he died At a memorial service for Tyng Duffield gave a sermon based on Ephesians 6:14 Stand firm wearing the whole armor of God and ended it by reciting the new hymn he had written as a tribute The hymn was first brought into public knowledge through leaflets printed by the superintendent of the local Christian school containing the words of the hymn One of these leaflets ended up being published in a Baptist newspaper and Stand Up Stand Up for Jesus was published in The Church Psalmist in 1859
After first publication the hymn was popular and was sung by both the Union and Confederate soldiers in the American Civil War The hymn also became popular among British revivalists and within public schools in England As a result of the images of Christian militarism in the hymn some people object to the hymn and some people do not stand to sing it The hymn was excluded from a more politically correct volume of The Presbyterian Hymnal published in June 1990 in order not to offend handicapped people
Tune
Several melodies have been written for Stand Up Stand Up for Jesus The one used most often now was written by George James Webb who had originally composed it in 1837 for Tis Dawn the Lark is Singing a song in a secular musical show performed on a ship travelling across the Atlantic Ocean

Plot
Bob Mitchell Dabney Coleman and his wife Jean Cloris Leachman are driving through the hot Arizona desert on their way home to Los Angeles A detour has taken them 100 miles out of the way down a deserted road...because Jean insisted on taking photographs of a particular area to take back to their daughter Bob is irritated by the delay in getting home - and after throwing a few jabs at Jean the two stop at a roadside cafe/inn called the Arroyo Motel It's a rundown claptrap and aside from the cook Jim Cutler Ross Martin and one customer named Tom Ned Beatty the place is empty.But the two travelers are hungry and the diner will do for now To their surprise both Jim and Tom are hostile and downright rude to them The situation makes Jean uncomfortable She tries to call home using the payphone but the line is busy
Jean gets up to go to the restroom and wash her face When she returns Bob is nowhere to be found Perhaps he went to use the bathroom himself she thinks Their station wagon is still parked outside.Minutes pass and still no Bob A tight-lipped Jim and Tom are extremely unhelpful telling Jean that Bob probably just abandoned her At Jean's request Tom agrees to go into the men's room to see if her husband is alright The seconds seem to take forever but when he emerges he tells Jean that Bob isn't there
Jean goes next door to the motel where a woman named Vi Louise Latham works the front desk She's also vaguely unfriendly and of no help Unbeknownst to Jean hurried calls are being made between Vi and Jim in the diner.Starting to worry even more Jean tries to go inside the cafe men's room but it is locked Jim finally opens the door when Jean threatens to call the police Bob isn't around naturally but she does notice a second door...that may lead to another exit.The cook refuses to open it for her and Jean contacts the police Meanwhile someone drives off in the Mitchell station wagon and Jean runs out screaming for her husband
Night has now fallen and the Sheriff Dana Elcar arrives As Jean tells her story the officer looks bewildered It all sounds so far-fetched In fact the door to the men's room isn't locked The other door inside leads to an old storage shed...but still no trace of Bob An APB is put out for the car and Jean plans on staying in the motel until further notice from the Sheriff Neither Jim nor Vi are particularly happy to have her hang around And despite Jean's plea for him to check out the other rooms the Sheriff doesn't see any cause to do so
Later Vi refuses to place a call to the FBI and Jean is unable reach her home in Los Angeles Jean confronts Vi and tells her I don't know what's going on here but I will find out The now frantic wife has no choice but to search around the motel by herself She enters the shed behind the men's room Peeking through the keyhole into the restroom beyond she spies Tom entering on the other side...and immediately she notices a light bulb illuminate next to her That's how they did it she thinks A third man must have been hiding in the shed when Bob entered the restroom...the lighted bulb must have served as an alert to the kidnapper that it was time to nab her husband...leaving Tom and Jim free to distract her as they carried off their plan
At that moment Jean is relieved to see the family vehicle pull up But instead of Bob stepping out she is frightened by a tall hulking character with a limp played by Ron Feinberg She runs into some underbrush and when Tom comes near her she whacks him with a stick And then at last she catches a glimpse of her husband...bound and gagged he's being shuffled into the station wagon and driven away
The Sheriff returns and this time he believes her story The two drive through the desert towards an abandoned pump station while Tom follows behind The Sheriff tells her that the man with the limp is named Lou McDermott and that he recently jumped parole Oh...and there have been other mysterious disappearances a fact he neglected to tell Jean earlier At the gas station the Sheriff shoots and kills Lou and then the officer himself is snuffed out by Tom Jean grabs the steering wheel of the police vehicle and tries to run Tom down - but she's caught
Both Bob and Jean are taken back to the motel and are kept in Jim's truck until the three perpetrators can figure out what to do Vi turns on Jim and shoots him As she comes towards the truck with gun in hand Jean lights a flare and blinds Vi She then grabs the revolver and holds both Vi and Jim at bay until the authorities arrive Now safe Jean places a tearful call to her children and tells her daughter they had a fine time on their trip They're coming home she says...fast as they can

Release
Dying Room Only had its world premiere on ABC as part of the network's Movie of the Week series airing for the first time on September 18 1973 Although the film was praised for its acting and cinematography it did receive feminist criticism for its positioning of Leachman's character as a helpless woman who has had her selfhood stolen when she loses her husband In review after its world broadcast Jack Friedman of The Village Voice criticized the film saying The only frightening aspect of this tale of horror was that its latent hatred class regional sexual were being spewed all across the country And the loam out there is rich enough already
After its premiere in 1973 the film became a staple of late night TV airing erratically throughout the 1970s and 1980s It was also released on VHS and later on DVD in 2010 through the Warner Archive Collection

Stanley Hall Clayfield

Stanley Hall is a heritage-listed former residence at 25 Enderley Road Clayfield City of Brisbane Queensland Australia It was first built in 1885 and redeveloped to a design by architect George Henry Male Addison It is also known as St Rita's Convent School It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992
History
This large masonry residence was erected -86 as a single-storeyed building for successful Brisbane produce dealer John William Forth The house was remodelled and two-storeyed additions were constructed for the subsequent owner Western Queensland pastoralist Herbert Hunter in 1890
The site was part of a larger parcel of land comprising portions 86-90 parish of Toombul first alienated by Brisbane businessman James Sutherland in 1858 Sutherland's interest in this property was purely speculative He later subdivided portions 86 & 87 into four allotments but in 1879 transferred the bulk of these subdivisions approximately 23 acres to Queensland pastoralist and politician William Alcock Tully Tully also acquired the property as an investment and in 1881 sold subdivisions 3 & 4 of portions 86 & 87 comprising over 12.5 acres to another Queensland pastoralist politician and businessman Charles Lumley Hill This property was transferred in January 1885 to John William Forth who subsequently erected Stanley Hall on the site
John Forth and his wife Selina had arrived in Brisbane in May 1857 when in their early twenties and had been associated with the development of Brisbane for close to thirty years before acquiring the Albion now Clayfield property Forth built up a successful wholesale and retail produce business in Brisbane and was alderman for the East Ward in 1882 and 1883 In the early 1880s the family - which included 10 children by August 1880 - was resident on Wickham Terrace Stanley Hall appears to have been erected for the Forth family in 1885-86
The Forths resided only a short time at Stanley Hall Clara Forth their 20 year old daughter died there in 1886 and shortly after the family returned from a visit to Europe toward the end of the year John Forth was killed while helping transplant trees in a paddock near his home on 28 December 1886
The property had been transferred to Selina Forth in April 1886 but after John's death the family moved back to Wickham Terrace in 1887 and let Stanley Hall to Brisbane sharebroker and commission agent John Wilson In August 1888 the property was transferred to Herbert Hunter who at the same time borrowed Åí6,000 from Selina Forth
Hunter had emigrated from Scotland to Australia in 1863 when aged 27 He tried a variety of jobs eventually gaining employment as a clerk on William Miles Dulacca sheep station on the Condamine River near Roma In 1866 Hunter married Miles daughter Jessie and ran Dulacca for his father-in-law for some years Miles transferred to Hunter the lease of Redford station in the Maranoa district in the early 1870s and Victoria Downs in the Warrego district by the mid-1870s Hunter had disposed of Redford by the mid-1880s but retained the vast consolidated run of Victoria Downs Stanley Hall was purchased in 1888 as his town house
A successful grazier and horse racing enthusiast Hunter appears to have acquired Stanley Hall more for its proximity to the Eagle Farm Racecourse than for the house itself which he subsequently redeveloped into the present grand residence In 1889 he commissioned Brisbane architect GHM Addison to remodel the existing house and design extensive additions at a cost of Åí3,550 The house was virtually re-built 1889-90 and an upper storey and tower were added permitting views of the nearby racecourse and across the Brisbane River to Moreton Bay A gabled timber coachhouse and stables were erected near the house and an extensive orchard was established occupying the block now bounded by Enderley and Alexandra Roads and Florence and Craven Streets
Hunter eventually sold Stanley Hall in 1910 to wealthy pastoralist Edward Goddard Blume who owned a string of stations principally sheep throughout Queensland and New South Wales Like Hunter he owned several racehorses and won a number of Melbourne and Caulfield cups Blume was well known in Queensland social circles and during the visit of the Prince of Wales to Brisbane in July 1920 entertained the Prince at Stanley Hall
In the early 1920s Blume subdivided and sold off the bulk of the property and in 1926 the house on 4.5 acres of land was sold to the Order of the Sisters of the Presentation in Queensland for Åí22,000 At Stanley Hall the sisters established the present St Rita's Convent School in September 1926 In subsequent years the school expanded with the first new building erected in 1939 The attached single- storeyed kitchen and service wing was demolished in 1968 to make way for a new classroom block and the coachhouse and stables no longer survive None of the post-1926 structures is included in the Entry in the Heritage Register
Description
Stanley Hall is a substantial two-storeyed rendered masonry former residence located on the rise of Clayfield Heights The building is located at the core of St Rita's College overlooking a tree-lined entrance drive and front gardens to the north-east and capturing expansive views to the north and the east
Stanley Hall's complex form reflects its different stages of construction The ground floor 1885-86 is oriented north-east whilst the upper floor 1890 is orientated east west creating another primary frontage for the building The eastern elevation is asymmetrical and steps back to a single-storeyed bay to the south with a two-storeyed bay at the northern end adjacent to an off-centre tower which rises to three storeys The northern elevation is a more formal arrangement of two-storeyed bays flanking a now enclosed verandah A ground floor timber verandah encircles the building The corrugated iron roof comprises hipped roofs over bays projecting from central hipped roofs to the ground and first floors and skillions to the verandahs The tower has a crested mansard roof
The building retains some of its rich ornamentation The first floor bays on the northern frontage have single windows framed by pilasters and are encircled with cornices with a parapet with pediments above the windows The two-storeyed parapeted bay to the eastern frontage has a now enclosed belvedere with arched openings with imposts extrados keystones small balustrades and parapet with stepped cornice The tower has rectangular windows to first floor level surmounted by arched windows encircled in elaborately detailed Dutch gables The Dutch gables have festooning and are interspersed with acroteria on pedestals The tower makes a large footprint on the ground floor which frames the main entrance and has arched openings with keystones
The verandah which surrounds the building to north east and partially to the west has timber boarded ceilings fine lattice spandrels and cast iron balustrades It is supported on paired chamfered posts with small curvilinear valances On the northern frontage substantial timber posts and bases with arched cast iron valances which are probably part of the 1885-86 building are located within the verandah
Internally Stanley Hall comprises grander rooms relating to the projecting bays at the ends of the building interlinked by more modest and service rooms accessed by central corridors on each level The building contains finely crafted elements throughout The centrally located main entrance has fine stained glass surrounds with a hibiscus motif The entrance hall opens onto an impressive cedar staircase with richly turned and carved balusters and newels and fine timber panels The corridors to the ground floor have fluted cedar panels to dado level and panelled cedar doors The former dining room to the south has a fireplace with a richly carved timber mantelpiece and fine hand-painted tiled hearth The Drawing Room to the north has an arcade which separates a central rectangular space from peripheral pocket spaces formed by the projecting bays The arcades have cast iron column on cedar-encased bases with floriated capitals and extrados and keystones to the arches The drawing room fireplace has richly carved surrounds The Prince of Wales room immediately behind the Drawing Room has a marble mantelpiece and tall timber doors opening onto the verandah Amongst the ground floor service rooms is a former strong room which contains a substantial cast iron safe The first floor contains bedrooms and a former bathroom with an access hatch to the tower these rooms command an excellent view of Eagle Farm
Stanley Hall retains much of its earlier ironmongery including push plates and locks which are more richly ornamented in living areas of the building and more plain in service areas
The grounds of Stanley Hall to the north-east contain mature trees including camphor laurels jacarandas figs palms and several species of pines which mark the boundaries line the driveway and intersperse the grounds
